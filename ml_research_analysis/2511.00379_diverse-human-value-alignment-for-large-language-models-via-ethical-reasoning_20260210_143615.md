# Diverse Human Value Alignment for Large Language Models via Ethical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.00379
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00379
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Framework improves LLM performance on SafeWorld benchmark by 17.44 and 2.89 points on average for norm identification and value alignment.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a theory-grounded ethical reasoning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance alignment with diverse human values across cultures and regions. Inspired by established ethical decision-making models, the framework employs a five-step process—fact gathering, hierarchical social norm identification, option generation, multi-lens ethical impact analysis (Deontology, Common Good, Utilitarianism, Justice), and reflection—to guide LLMs through deliberative ethical reasoning rather than superficial pattern recognition. Evaluated on the SafeWorld benchmark, the framework significantly improves LLM performance in both social norm identification and culturally appropriate reasoning, outperforming baseline methods by 17.44 and 2.89 points on average. The approach offers a practical pathway toward more interpretable, culturally sensitive, and globally aligned AI systems.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a five-step ethical reasoning process that can be deployed via prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning. It processes user queries through sequential modules: fact extraction, hierarchical norm identification (prioritizing legal requirements over cultural norms), option enumeration, multi-lens evaluation using four ethical theories, and reflection. The approach was evaluated on SafeWorld, a benchmark of 2,775 queries spanning 50 countries and 493 regions with grounded social norms. Performance was measured using Norm Identification Score (S_norm) and Value Alignment Score (S_align), both judged by Qwen2.5-72B with specific scoring prompts. The framework was compared against Vanilla, Chain-of-Thought, and TDM baselines across multiple LLM models including GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-72B, Llama3.3-70B, and DeepSeek-R1.

## Key Results
- The framework achieved 17.44 and 2.89 point improvements over baseline methods on average for S_norm and S_align respectively across all models.
- Ablation studies confirmed that each ethical lens (Deontology, Common Good, Utilitarianism, Justice) contributes positively to performance, with removal of any single theory decreasing average scores.
- Hierarchical norm identification significantly improved norm coverage, particularly for underrepresented regions, though some challenges remained with norm hallucination.
- The approach demonstrated consistent improvements across different model sizes and architectures, validating its generalizability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured five-step deliberation nudges LLMs from superficial pattern-matching toward more deliberate ethical reasoning.
- Mechanism: By forcing sequential processing through (1) fact gathering, (2) norm identification, (3) option generation, (4) multi-lens evaluation, and (5) reflection, the framework disrupts "System-1" heuristic responses. It grounds reasoning in context before any judgment, making hidden assumptions explicit and examinable.
- Core assumption: LLMs possess latent capacity for deliberative reasoning that can be elicited via structured prompts or fine-tuning; they do not require intrinsic moral agency, only consistent scaffolding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an interpretable reasoning process... which can be implemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods."
  - [PAGE 2] "Current alignment approaches often yield superficial conformity rather than genuine ethical understanding, failing to address the complex, context-dependent nature of human values."
  - [PAGE 2] "Recent works suggests that diverse human value alignment requires System-2 process of slow, deliberative reasoning..."
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbors reinforce interest in value alignment across cultures, but no direct empirical test of System-1 vs. System-2 framing.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-lens ethical impact analysis using Deontology, Common Good, Utilitarianism, and Justice provides complementary coverage that reduces one-sided judgments.
- Mechanism: Each lens foregrounds a different dimension—rule compliance, community welfare, aggregate outcomes, and fairness. Sequential evaluation through all four forces the model to articulate trade-offs rather than defaulting to a single heuristic, increasing coverage of value pluralism.
- Core assumption: These four theories are sufficient and complementary for diverse cultural contexts; the sequencing does not introduce order effects that bias outcomes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multiple-lens ethical impact analysis (Deontology, Common Good, Utilitarianism, Justice)"
  - [PAGE 5] "By evaluating options sequentially through these complementary lenses, our framework ensures that the potential ethical impact is evaluated in a balanced, multi-dimensional manner..."
  - [PAGE 8] Ablation study shows removing any single theory decreases average performance across models.
  - [corpus] Related work on multi-value alignment supports benefits of handling conflicting values, but does not validate this specific four-theory combination.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical social norm identification improves accuracy by prioritizing legal requirements over cultural norms, reducing the "homogenization" error.
- Mechanism: The explicit hierarchy (laws > policies > social values > cultural norms) gives the model a principled precedence order when norms conflict. This reduces the tendency to apply one-size-fits-all norms across regions and improves context-sensitive retrieval or inference.
- Core assumption: A fixed hierarchy is appropriate across all contexts; local exceptions or context-driven reversals (e.g., civil disobedience scenarios) are rare or out of scope.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [PAGE 4] "recognizing and prioritizing applicable social norms in hierarchical order from legal requirements to cultural norms relevant to the specific context."
  - [PAGE 4] "The hierarchical structure provides principled guidance when facing conflicting norms across different levels..."
  - [PAGE 8] Table 3 shows substantial improvements in S_norm across models compared to baselines.
  - [corpus] Neighbors emphasize cultural variability but do not provide comparative hierarchy frameworks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: System-1 vs. System-2 cognition
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly frames current alignment methods as System-1 (fast, pattern-based) and its framework as encouraging System-2 (slow, deliberative). Understanding this distinction explains why structured prompting helps.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify which step in the five-step framework most directly counters "fast" pattern-matching behavior?

- Concept: Value pluralism and norm conflict
  - Why needed here: The framework assumes values often conflict and that multi-lens analysis helps navigate this. You need to understand what "pluralism" means to interpret the ablation results.
  - Quick check question: What does it imply when ablating any single ethical lens reduces performance across the board?

- Concept: Prompt engineering vs. supervised fine-tuning as alignment strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes both implementations, each with tradeoffs. Understanding these helps you choose a deployment strategy.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions would SFT be preferred over prompt engineering for this framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Fact extraction -> Norm identification (hierarchical) -> Option generation -> Multi-lens evaluation (Deontology, Common Good, Utilitarianism, Justice) -> Reflection -> Final response

- Critical path:
  Fact gathering → Norm identification → Option generation → Multi-lens evaluation → Reflection → Final response
  Failure at Step 2 (wrong norms) propagates through all downstream steps.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt engineering: Zero training cost, transparent, easy to customize; but limited by base model's parametric knowledge.
  - SFT: Internalizes reasoning patterns and improves norm knowledge; but requires curated CoT data, compute, and may reduce flexibility.
  - Fixed hierarchy: Simplifies conflict resolution; but may not reflect region-specific norm orderings.

- Failure signatures:
  - Norm hallucination: Model cites laws or policies that do not exist for a region.
  - Lens imbalance: Model heavily weights one theory (often Deontology) while superficially addressing others.
  - Context bleed: Reasoning from prior queries contaminates current query's norm identification.
  - Reflection inflation: Step 5 produces lengthy self-justifications without substantive strategy changes.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Prompt-only baseline on SafeWorld subset: Implement the five-step prompt on a capable base model, compare S_norm and S_align against vanilla and CoT baselines using the paper's evaluation prompts.
  2. Lens ablation: Remove one ethical theory at a time and measure the drop in S_norm and S_align. Confirm the paper's finding that each lens contributes positively.
  3. Region-specific error analysis: For the bottom-performing 10% of regions by S_norm, manually inspect whether failures are due to missing norm knowledge, hierarchy misapplication, or reasoning errors. This informs whether to prioritize RAG integration or SFT data augmentation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) implementation be effectively scaled without degrading the model's general reasoning capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in the "Limitations and Future Research" section that due to resource constraints, they primarily validated the framework via prompt engineering and plan to "address potential conflicts between ethical reasoning and general reasoning capabilities" in future SFT work.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if embedding the complex, five-step ethical chain-of-thought deeply into model weights causes "catastrophic forgetting" of other general skills or logical reasoning abilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of model performance on general benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) before and after applying the proposed SFT scheme.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the framework be augmented to mitigate hallucinations of social norms for underrepresented regions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a reliance on internal LLM knowledge as a limitation, noting that "models sometimes make inaccurate norm inferences or even hallucinations, particularly for less-represented regions."
- Why unresolved: The current prompt-based implementation relies solely on the model's parametric knowledge, which is known to be sparse or biased for specific cultural contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration of the proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module followed by a reduction in factual errors within the "Identify Social Norms" step for low-resource regions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What evaluation metrics can effectively capture the quality and transparency of the ethical reasoning process itself, rather than just the final output?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that their current evaluation framework "primarily focuses on result-oriented metrics" and lacks insight into reasoning reliability.
- Why unresolved: Current metrics (S_norm, S_align) score the final answer but fail to verify if the model followed the theoretical framework correctly or if the reasoning was consistent.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of automated "process-oriented metrics" that correlate strongly with human expert assessment of the generated reasoning chain.

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on the model's parametric knowledge of regional norms, which may be insufficient for underrepresented regions, leading to norm hallucinations.
- The fixed hierarchical ordering of social norms may not accurately reflect real-world norm precedence in all cultural contexts, particularly where local religious or customary laws override civil laws.
- The current evaluation focuses on final output metrics (S_norm, S_align) rather than the quality and consistency of the reasoning process itself, limiting insight into reasoning reliability.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The conceptual validity of the five-step deliberative framework and its mechanism for improving reasoning depth, supported by clear articulation and ablation results.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the four-theory multi-lens approach, as ablation shows each lens contributes positively, but the specific combination's sufficiency across all cultures is not fully validated.
- **Medium confidence**: The hierarchical norm identification approach, given reported improvements in S_norm, but uncertainty remains about whether the fixed order generalizes to all cultural contexts.
- **Low confidence**: The completeness of the SFT evaluation, as the paper describes the method but does not report results, leaving a gap in understanding the full potential of the framework.

## Next Checks

1. **Replicate LLM-as-judge evaluation:** Obtain the exact judge prompts and few-shot examples from the appendix, then rerun the evaluation on a subset of SafeWorld queries to verify S_norm and S_align scores match reported values.
2. **Test hierarchical norm ordering robustness:** For the bottom 10% of regions by S_norm, manually inspect failures to determine if they stem from hierarchy misapplication or missing norm knowledge, then adjust the hierarchy or integrate region-specific ordering rules.
3. **Implement and evaluate SFT variant:** Generate a small CoT dataset from SafeWorld using the five-step reasoning process, fine-tune a base model, and compare performance against the prompt-only version to quantify the SFT contribution.
