# Pose-Based Sign Language Spotting via an End-to-End Encoder Architecture

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.08738
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08738
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** First end-to-end video-to-video sign language spotting method; achieves 61.74% F1-score on WSLP 2025 Word Presence Prediction dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first end-to-end video-to-video sign language spotting method, designed to detect the presence of a query sign within a continuous sentence-level sign video. The approach leverages pose keypoint representations extracted via MediaPipe, encoding them using 2D CNNs to preserve spatial topology, and modeling temporal dependencies with a BERT-style transformer. A binary classification head predicts sign presence, avoiding reliance on intermediate gloss or text-based representations. Evaluated on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from WSLP 2025, the method achieves 61.66% accuracy and 61.74% F1-score. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of 2D pose encoding and binary cross-entropy loss, establishing a strong baseline for automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

## Method Summary
The method processes query and sentence sign videos through MediaPipe pose extraction to obtain 50 keypoints × 2 coordinates per frame. Each frame is reshaped into a 2D grid and encoded via 2D CNNs to preserve spatial topology. Query and sentence token sequences are concatenated with special [CLS] and [SEP] tokens and passed through a BERT-style transformer encoder with positional and token-type embeddings. A binary classification head operates on the [CLS] token representation to predict sign presence. The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss, with contrastive loss as an optional auxiliary objective. This end-to-end architecture avoids intermediate gloss representations, enabling direct video-to-video spotting.

## Key Results
- Achieves 61.66% accuracy and 61.74% F1-score on WSLP 2025 Word Presence Prediction dataset
- 2D CNN spatial encoding outperforms 1D CNN by 7.7% accuracy on validation set
- Binary cross-entropy loss alone outperforms contrastive loss and combined training strategies
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of 2D pose encoding and BCE loss configuration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** 2D CNN encoding of pose keypoints preserves spatial topology better than 1D projection, improving sign discrimination.
- **Mechanism:** Reshaping each pose frame (50 keypoints × 2 coordinates) into a 2D grid allows convolutional filters to learn geometric patterns such as hand configurations and body posture relationships, rather than treating keypoints as an arbitrary 1D sequence.
- **Core assumption:** Spatial adjacency in the 2D reshaping corresponds to meaningful biomechanical relationships (e.g., finger joints cluster together).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] Table 2 shows 2D CNN achieves 61.39% accuracy vs. 53.65% for 1D CNN on validation; precision improves from 52.29% to 60.49%.
  - [section] Section 2.3: "2D-CNN preserves spatial structure by reshaping each frame as an n×2 grid... allowing the network to learn spatial patterns such as hand configurations and body postures."
  - [corpus] Related work SignX (arXiv:2504.16315) also uses compact pose-rich latent space, suggesting pose-based representations are effective for SLR.
- **Break condition:** If keypoints were randomly shuffled or spatial grouping was meaningless, 2D structure would provide no advantage over 1D.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** BERT-style [CLS] and [SEP] token architecture enables cross-sequence attention between query and candidate videos, supporting semantic alignment.
- **Mechanism:** Prepending a [CLS] token captures global sequence representation; inserting [SEP] between query and sentence tokens allows the transformer's self-attention to compute relationships across the boundary, identifying if query pose patterns appear in the candidate sequence.
- **Core assumption:** Attention scores between query and candidate tokens reflect meaningful visual-semantic correspondence.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] Section 2.4: "The attention scores between query and candidate pose tokens serve as a key mechanism for measuring their semantic and spatial correspondence."
  - [section] Section 2.4: "Learnable positional encodings and token-type embeddings are incorporated to preserve temporal order and to distinguish between query and candidate sequences."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison for video-to-video tokenization; related work focuses on gloss-based approaches (Spotter+GPT).
- **Break condition:** If positional or token-type embeddings were removed, the model could not distinguish query from candidate tokens, collapsing the cross-sequence comparison.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Binary cross-entropy loss outperforms contrastive loss for this presence/absence classification task.
- **Mechanism:** BCE directly optimizes the binary decision boundary, while contrastive loss learns an embedding space that may not align with the verification objective without careful tuning.
- **Core assumption:** The [CLS] token representation via max pooling is more discriminative for verification than mean-pooled embeddings used in contrastive learning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] Table 2: BCE only achieves 63.04% accuracy vs. 57.20% for contrastive only; combining losses (61.39%) still underperforms BCE alone.
  - [section] Section 4.2.1: "Contrastive supervision is not satisfactory enough for this task... the embedding space learned through mean pooling may be less discriminative than the [CLS] token representation."
  - [corpus] Weak external validation; no prior work directly compares BCE vs. contrastive for sign spotting specifically.
- **Break condition:** If contrastive loss weight were better tuned or if embedding dimensionality were increased, contrastive learning might close the gap—this remains untested.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pose Keypoint Representation**
  - **Why needed here:** The architecture operates on MediaPipe-extracted keypoints (42 hand + 8 body + 19 face = 69 used; paper mentions 50 keypoints × 2D), not raw RGB. Understanding how pose extraction filters visual noise while preserving articulation is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a pose representation might generalize better across signers than RGB pixels?

- **Concept: Transformer Self-Attention for Sequence Modeling**
  - **Why needed here:** The BERT-style encoder uses multi-head self-attention to model temporal dependencies and cross-sequence interactions between query and sentence tokens.
  - **Quick check question:** How does adding a [SEP] token change what the attention mechanism can learn compared to processing sequences independently?

- **Concept: Binary vs. Contrastive Learning Objectives**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly compares BCE and contrastive losses, showing BCE is better suited for this verification task. Understanding when to use each is critical for similar retrieval problems.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might contrastive loss struggle when the task is presence/absence rather than ranking or similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Pose extraction → 2D reshaping (50×2 grid) → CNN spatial encoding → Token concatenation with [CLS] and [SEP] → Transformer attention → [CLS] max pooling → MLP classifier

- **Critical path:** Pose extraction → 2D reshaping (50×2 grid) → CNN spatial encoding → Token concatenation with [CLS] and [SEP] → Transformer attention → [CLS] max pooling → MLP classifier

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 2D CNN vs. 1D CNN: 2D preserves spatial topology; ablation shows +7.7% accuracy gain on validation
  - BCE vs. Contrastive: BCE-only training outperforms contrastive-only by 5.8% accuracy; combining losses degrades performance
  - Max pooling vs. Mean pooling: Paper uses max pooling on [CLS] token; suggests mean pooling is less discriminative for this task

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low recall with high precision (as in 2D CNN test results: 67.16% precision, 61.74% recall) suggests conservative predictions—may miss subtle or co-articulated signs
  - Contrastive loss underperforming may indicate embedding space collapse or insufficient negative sampling
  - If early/late frames without finger movement are not skipped, model may attend to irrelevant segments

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce ablation:** Train with 1D CNN encoder and compare validation accuracy against 2D CNN; expect ~7–8% gap per Table 2.
  2. **Loss function sweep:** Run BCE-only, contrastive-only (with temperature τ=0.07 per paper), and BCE+contrastive (λ=0.5); verify BCE-only achieves highest accuracy.
  3. **Token structure test:** Remove [SEP] token or shuffle positional encodings and measure performance drop; expect degraded cross-sequence attention and lower accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a specific weighting strategy for contrastive loss be identified to surpass the performance of standalone Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 4.2.1 that contrastive supervision "may interfere with classification if the weight is not carefully tuned," suggesting that optimal tuning is an unsolved aspect of the current architecture.
- Why unresolved: The fixed weight (λ=0.5) used in experiments resulted in lower performance than BCE-only, but the authors hypothesize that different weights could yield better results.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic hyperparameter search over contrastive loss weights demonstrating superior F1-scores compared to the BCE baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the spatial encoding mechanism be modified to close the performance gap between precision and recall observed in the 2D CNN model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 notes that while the 2D-CNN approach improved accuracy and precision, the F1-score "slightly decreases due to the precision-recall trade-off" compared to the 1D variant.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes the 2D approach as a baseline but does not propose a solution to the specific drop in recall associated with preserving spatial topology.
- What evidence would resolve it: An architectural variation (e.g., attention mechanisms or modified pooling) that maintains high precision while recovering the recall levels of the 1D model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can this binary presence prediction framework be extended to provide precise temporal localization (start and end times) for the spotted sign?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The introduction defines sign spotting as the ability to "locate and identify" signs, yet the methodology restricts the output to a binary presence score using a [CLS] token, leaving the localization aspect unaddressed.
- Why unresolved: The current model collapses the temporal sequence into a global classification token, discarding the frame-level information necessary to pinpoint when the sign occurs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modification of the architecture to output frame-level probabilities or temporal boundaries alongside the binary classification.

## Limitations
- Relies on pre-extracted pose keypoints, inheriting errors from MediaPipe tracking, particularly for rapid or occluded hand movements
- 61.74% F1-score indicates substantial false negatives and positives, suggesting difficulty with co-articulation and contextual variation
- Evaluation dataset lacks signer diversity, limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The 2D CNN spatial encoding mechanism and its advantage over 1D CNN (Section 2.3, Table 2) - supported by clear ablation and reasonable biomechanical assumptions.
- **Medium confidence:** The BERT-style cross-sequence attention mechanism - the role of [SEP] and [CLS] tokens is well-explained, but lacks direct comparison with alternative token structures.
- **Medium confidence:** The superiority of BCE over contrastive loss - supported by ablation but lacks broader corpus validation or alternative contrastive configurations.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to pose extraction errors:** Inject synthetic noise into keypoint coordinates (e.g., Gaussian noise, missing frames) and measure performance degradation to assess sensitivity to MediaPipe tracking failures.
2. **Generalization across signers:** Evaluate on a signer-disjoint test set or via leave-one-signer-out cross-validation to quantify generalization beyond the original training cohort.
3. **Temporal attention analysis:** Visualize attention weights between query and candidate tokens to verify that the model focuses on semantically relevant segments rather than arbitrary frame regions.
