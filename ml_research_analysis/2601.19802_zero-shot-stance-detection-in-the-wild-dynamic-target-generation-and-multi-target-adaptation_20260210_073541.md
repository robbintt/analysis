# Zero-Shot Stance Detection in the Wild: Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19802
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fine-tuned large language models outperform pre-trained models in zero-shot stance detection with dynamic target generation, with two-stage fine-tuning achieving highest target recognition (66.99% C-Score) and integrated fine-tuning achieving highest stance F1 (79.26%)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel zero-shot stance detection task called "Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation" (DGTA) that requires models to dynamically generate and adapt to multiple targets in text without prior target knowledge. The authors construct a Chinese social media dataset with 70,931 annotated samples and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for target identification and stance detection. Two fine-tuning strategies for large language models are explored: integrated (end-to-end) and two-stage (separate target extraction and stance classification). Experimental results show that fine-tuned LLMs significantly outperform pre-trained models and prompted models, with the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieving the highest target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B attains a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%. The study also demonstrates that reasoning-capable models perform better, and that introducing chain-of-thought improves prompted LLM performance.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a Chinese Weibo dataset with 70,931 samples across 36 topics using a multi-LLM consensus annotation pipeline. They employ two fine-tuning strategies using LoRA on 7B parameter models: integrated (end-to-end generation of target-stance pairs) and two-stage (separate target identification and stance detection models). The evaluation uses a C-Score metric combining BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE-L for target identification, with strict threshold filtering before stance detection F1 calculation. The task requires identifying multiple target-stance pairs from text without predefined targets, using a dataset split of 8:1:1 for train/val/test with stratified sampling across 7 different seeds.

## Key Results
- Two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves highest comprehensive target recognition score (66.99% C-Score)
- Integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves highest stance detection F1 score (79.26%)
- Reasoning-capable models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill) outperform standard instruct models (Qwen2.5) particularly for implicit targets
- Chain-of-thought prompting improves prompted LLM performance on this task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Decoupling vs. Integration Trade-off
Decoupling target identification from stance classification (two-stage fine-tuning) improves target recall by allowing exclusive focus on extraction (95.19% Recall for Qwen2.5-7B), while integrated fine-tuning improves stance F1 by modeling inter-target relationships simultaneously. The trade-off breaks if the first stage makes extraction errors, as the second stage cannot recover stances for missed targets.

### Mechanism 2: Reasoning Distillation Advantage
Models with distilled reasoning capabilities (DeepSeek-R1-Distill) outperform standard instruct models (Qwen2.5) in complex stance detection, specifically for implicit targets. Reasoning distillation equips the model with better semantic handling of irony, metaphor, or implicit sentiment that standard instruction tuning might miss. This advantage diminishes for extremely short or purely explicit texts where complex reasoning adds unnecessary latency.

### Mechanism 3: Multi-LLM Consensus Annotation
Multi-LLM collaborative annotation with cross-validation creates higher-quality dataset for "wild" targets than single-model generation. By requiring consensus among three diverse models (GLM4, Qwen, Llama) and using a fourth (DeepSeek-V3) for scoring, the system filters out hallucinations and ensures label stability. This mechanism fails if models share common bias on specific niche topics, leading to false consensus.

## Foundational Learning

- **Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD)**: Understanding the baseline ZSSD constraint (detecting stance on unseen targets) is necessary to appreciate the difficulty of dynamic target generation. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between "cross-target" stance detection (standard ZSSD) and "open-world" stance detection (this paper's task)?

- **Generative Evaluation Metrics (BERTScore/ROUGE)**: Traditional classification uses Accuracy/F1, but this task generates variable-length text targets requiring semantic similarity metrics (BERTScore) versus lexical overlap (BLEU) to interpret C-Score results. Quick check: Why would Exact Match accuracy be a poor metric for evaluating a model that extracts "Tesla's price-cutting strategy" when the label is "Tesla"?

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Understanding parameter-efficient fine-tuning is necessary to replicate integrated vs. two-stage baselines without excessive hardware. Quick check: How does freezing base model weights and training small adapter matrices affect the risk of "catastrophic forgetting" compared to full fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Weibo text -> Regex cleaning (emojis/URLs) -> LLM Consensus Annotation Pipeline (Data Creation) -> Model Backbone (Qwen2.5-7B or DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) -> LoRA modules applied to attention layers -> List of (Target, Stance) tuples

- **Critical path:** The Evaluation Logic is most brittle component. The system calculates C-Score (Target) before allowing Stance F1 calculation. If target extraction BERTScore < 0.7, stance prediction is ignored in metrics. Must optimize target extraction first.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Target Granularity vs. Recall: High recall often comes at cost of semantic fragmentation (e.g., "Baidu AI" vs "Wenxin Yiyan"). Integrated vs. Two-Stage: Integrated offers higher Stance F1 (+4% approx) but lower Target C-Score. Choose Two-Stage if extracting all entities is business-critical; choose Integrated if accuracy of detected stance is paramount.

- **Failure signatures:** Semantic Fragmentation (breaking complex events into disjointed entities), Implicit Stance Blindness (predicting "Neutral" for targets with sarcasm/metaphor), Over-generation of targets leading to low Recall.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Validation: Reproduce Qwen2.5-7B two-stage vs. integrated results on provided test set (seed=13) to validate LoRA config. 2) Threshold Sensitivity: Vary C-Score threshold (currently 0.3) to observe how "strictness" on target quality impacts final Stance F1 score. 3) Implicit Target Ablation: Isolate "implicit" test subset and compare DeepSeek-R1 vs. Qwen2.5 to verify if reasoning distillation specifically aids implicit semantic reasoning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Cross-Domain Generalization:** To what extent does model performance degrade when applied to rare, long-tailed topics within the dataset? The reported average metrics may mask specific failures on 22 sparse topics with fewer than 10 users.

- **Semantic Integrity Preservation:** How can models better preserve semantic integrity of complex or implicit targets to prevent fragmentation? Current fine-tuning strategies encourage entity extraction but fail to model dependency between words forming single abstract target.

- **Multi-Target Scaling Limit:** What mechanisms are required to close performance gap between dual-target and multi-target (>3) scenarios? Sharp decline in target identification (C-Score dropping from ~68% to ~45%) as number of targets increases.

## Limitations
- Dataset Generality: Evaluation on Chinese Weibo corpus raises questions about performance transfer to other languages, domains, or cultural contexts.
- Target Definition Ambiguity: C-Score evaluation uses strict exact match criteria that may systematically exclude partially correct or semantically equivalent targets.
- Model Size Bias: Study compares only 7B parameter models, unclear whether differences are due to reasoning capacity or other confounding factors.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Relative performance ranking between integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies is well-supported by ablation study and consistent across multiple metrics.
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that reasoning-capable models specifically improve implicit stance detection performance is supported by examples but lacks systematic ablation across different types of implicit targets.
- **Low Confidence:** Generalization of "dynamic target generation in the wild" framing beyond Chinese Weibo domain is speculative.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Evaluate two-stage and integrated fine-tuned models on English Twitter stance dataset to verify performance patterns hold across languages and platforms.

2. **Implicit Target Ablation:** Systematically categorize test instances by stance implicitness level and measure performance gap between DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen2.5 models specifically on implicit cases.

3. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary C-Score threshold from 0.1 to 0.5 and measure corresponding changes in stance F1 to determine optimal trade-off between target extraction quality and stance detection performance.
