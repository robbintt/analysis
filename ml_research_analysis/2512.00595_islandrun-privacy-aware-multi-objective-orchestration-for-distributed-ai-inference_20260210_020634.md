# IslandRun: Privacy-Aware Multi-Objective Orchestration for Distributed AI Inference

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.00595
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00595
- **Reference count:** 38
- **Primary result:** Agent-based system routing AI inference across heterogeneous compute islands while optimizing privacy, cost, latency, and trust

## Executive Summary
IslandRun addresses the challenge of multi-objective orchestration for AI inference across heterogeneous computing resources by treating resources as autonomous "islands" with varying trust, privacy, cost, and capacity profiles. The system introduces a novel agent-based architecture where specialized components decompose the optimization problem into modular, fault-tolerant units. Each agent exposes standardized scoring functions that enable compositional reasoning about multi-dimensional routing decisions.

The core routing algorithm employs a constraint-based approach that ensures privacy preservation while optimizing weighted combinations of cost, latency, and trust scores. Chat context privacy is maintained through reversible typed placeholder sanitization when crossing trust boundaries. The architecture enables users to maintain data sovereignty while accessing AI capabilities across heterogeneous environments, with applications in healthcare compliance, legal document processing, and personal productivity.

## Method Summary
IslandRun introduces a four-agent architecture (MIST for privacy, TIDE for resources, WAVES for routing, LIGHTHOUSE for coordination) that decomposes the multi-objective orchestration problem into specialized, fault-tolerant units. The system treats compute resources as autonomous "islands" with metadata including latency (L_j), cost (C_j), privacy score (P_j), trust score (T_j), and capacity (R_j(t)). The core routing algorithm filters islands by privacy compliance (P_j ≥ s_r) and optimizes a composite score combining cost, latency, and trust. A typed placeholder system preserves semantic context across trust boundaries through reversible sanitization.

## Key Results
- Formalization of privacy-aware multi-objective routing as constrained optimization problem
- Island group abstraction spanning personal ecosystems, private edge, and public cloud
- Data locality-first inference paradigm reducing privacy risks and costs
- Typed placeholder system preserving semantic context across trust boundaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by decomposing a complex multi-objective optimization problem into specialized agents that each handle a specific dimension of the routing decision. MIST performs sensitivity analysis using regex patterns and local classification to determine privacy requirements (s_r). TIDE monitors real-time resource capacity across islands. WAVES applies constraint-based filtering (P_j ≥ s_r) and optimizes weighted combinations of cost, latency, and trust. The route-then-sanitize pipeline ensures privacy preservation when crossing trust boundaries through typed placeholders that maintain semantic context.

## Foundational Learning

**Island Abstraction (why needed):** Models heterogeneous compute resources with varying trust and privacy profiles as autonomous entities with standardized metadata (latency, cost, privacy, trust, capacity scores). Quick check: Verify each island correctly exposes all required metadata fields.

**Privacy Scoring (why needed):** Quantifies sensitivity of inference requests using regex patterns and keyword matching to determine minimum privacy requirements (s_r). Quick check: Test MIST classifier on benchmark dataset with known sensitive/non-sensitive requests.

**Typed Placeholder System (why needed):** Preserves semantic context when sensitive data crosses trust boundaries through reversible sanitization using named entity recognition and bidirectional mapping. Quick check: Verify placeholder reconstruction accurately restores original context after multiple trust boundary crossings.

**Constraint-Based Routing (why needed):** Ensures privacy compliance by filtering islands based on minimum privacy requirements before optimization, preventing violations by design. Quick check: Audit routing decisions to confirm P_j ≥ s_r constraint is always enforced.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** MIST (privacy analysis) -> WAVES (routing decisions) -> TIDE (resource monitoring) -> LIGHTHOUSE (coordination); Route-then-sanitize pipeline crosses MIST and WAVES.

**Critical Path:** Inference request → MIST sensitivity scoring → WAVES island filtering (P_j ≥ s_r) → WAVES composite score optimization → placeholder sanitization if crossing trust boundaries → inference execution.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Agent-based architecture provides modularity and fault tolerance but introduces coordination overhead; privacy-first routing may increase latency; typed placeholders add complexity but preserve semantic context.

**Failure Signatures:** All requests routing to cloud despite low sensitivity (TIDE capacity reporting issue); privacy constraint violations under load (constraint bypass in routing logic); placeholder reconstruction failures (mapping storage/persistence issues).

**First Experiments:** 1) Implement mock island registry with three representative islands and verify metadata exposure. 2) Build MIST classifier and test on labeled sensitive/non-sensitive requests. 3) Create WAVES routing loop with constraint filtering and composite scoring.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Architectural overhead and real-world scalability concerns with four-agent coordination under high load
- Privacy quantification validity relies on unverified assumptions about MIST classifier accuracy and arbitrary trust score values
- Typed placeholder system complexity may not handle nested sensitive data or sophisticated privacy threats reliably

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Core routing algorithm structure and agent decomposition following established distributed systems patterns
**Medium Confidence:** Privacy-aware routing properties theoretically sound but rely on unverified classifier accuracy and trust boundary assumptions
**Low Confidence:** Real-world performance claims lack empirical validation; practical feasibility of agent coordination across heterogeneous networks unproven

## Next Checks
1. Implement benchmark dataset with labeled sensitive vs. non-sensitive inference requests and measure MIST classifier precision/recall against ground truth
2. Deploy four-agent architecture across three compute islands and measure routing decision latency, throughput, and resource utilization under varying request loads
3. Create test cases with nested sensitive data and complex data types to verify typed placeholder system's ability to preserve semantic meaning across trust boundary crossings
