# Multilingual Gloss-free Sign Language Translation: Towards Building a Sign Language Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.24355
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24355
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: Proposed gloss-free model achieves competitive performance across 10 sign languages with BLEU improvements of 1.71-2.24 on PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses multilingual sign language translation (MLSLT) by proposing a gloss-free model called Sign2(LID+Text) that uses dual Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objectives: one for token-level sign language identification (SLI) and another for spoken text generation. The hierarchical encoder structure explicitly identifies the sign language at the token level, helping manage language conflicts while the CTC-based alignment aids in accurate translation. Evaluated across three tasks (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many) on three benchmarks involving 10 sign languages, the model shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with token-level SLI proving especially effective in complex translation settings.

## Method Summary
The proposed Sign2(LID+Text) architecture uses a hierarchical encoder where the initial layer handles token-level sign language identification via CTC, and deeper layers perform translation with auxiliary TxtCTC alignment. The model uses SlowFastSign features pre-trained on spoken text (not glosses) and a Transformer backbone with joint CTC/Attention decoding. Training employs three losses: L_LID (weight 1), L_Txt (weight 5), and L_Attn (weight 3). The model is evaluated on SP-10 (8,300 samples across 10 SLs), PHOENIX14T (German SL, 7,096 samples), and CSL-Daily (Chinese SL, 18,401 samples).

## Key Results
- TxtCTC improves BLEU scores by 1.71 on PHOENIX14T and 2.24 on CSL-Daily
- In many-to-one setting, outperforms previous MLSLT systems by 0.58 BLEU
- Many-to-many setup maintains stable performance (6.22→4.58 BLEU) as language pairs increase from 2→2 to 10→10
- Token-level SLI especially effective in complex many-to-many settings (3.87→4.58 BLEU improvement)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Token-Level Sign Language Identification (SLI)
Token-level SLI mitigates language conflicts by providing fine-grained language identity cues throughout the sequence. The initial encoder layer learns classification task, conditioning deeper layers on language-specific patterns before translation begins, creating explicit alignment between sign representations and each target word.

### Mechanism 2: Text-Oriented CTC (TxtCTC) for Sign-Text Alignment
TxtCTC provides auxiliary alignment supervision that improves translation, especially for shorter and medium-length sentences. A CTC loss at the final encoder layer learns frame-to-token correspondences, with scores guiding beam search alongside the attention decoder during inference.

### Mechanism 3: Hierarchical Encoder with Layer-Wise Task Specialization
Assigning SLI to early layers and translation to deeper layers allows each task to operate at appropriate abstraction levels. The initial encoder layer handles token-level SLI (simpler task requiring less abstraction), while deeper layers reorder features for translation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC):**
  - Why needed: Core to both SLI and text alignment—learns to map variable-length video sequences to text without frame-level annotations
  - Quick check: Can you explain the role of the blank token in CTC and how the loss aggregates over all valid alignments?

- **Joint CTC/Attention Decoding:**
  - Why needed: Combines attention generation with CTC alignment guidance during beam search
  - Quick check: How does adding CTC scores to beam search differ from using attention probabilities alone?

- **Language Conflict in Multilingual Models:**
  - Why needed: The paper reports a 1.50 BLEU drop when training multilingually vs. individually
  - Quick check: Why might joint training on multiple sign languages hurt performance compared to separate single-language models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video → SlowFastSign features → Initial encoder (LIDtok CTC) → Deeper encoder → Final encoder (TxtCTC) + Attention decoder → Spoken text

- **Critical path:** SlowFastSign visual features → Initial encoder (LIDtok CTC) → Deeper encoder → Final encoder (TxtCTC) + Attention decoder → Spoken text

- **Design tradeoffs:** Gloss-free removes bottleneck but increases alignment difficulty; token-level SLI adds supervision but requires aligned LID labels; CTC provides explicit alignment but is monotonic-limited while attention handles reordering but can misalign without guidance

- **Failure signatures:** Long sentences (>30 tokens) show TxtCTC diminishing returns; SP-10 low-resource setting (830 samples/language, ~1.1k vocabulary); many-to-many scaling degrades from 6.22→4.58 BLEU; ablation without LIDtok shows more severe drops in complex settings

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce one-to-one TxtCTC effect: Train baseline Transformer on PHOENIX14T, add TxtCTC, expect ~1.7 BLEU improvement
  2. Ablate token-level SLI: Run many-to-one on SP-10 with λ₁=0 vs λ₁=1, expect ~0.5+ BLEU difference
  3. Sentence length stratification: Bucket test set by token length, plot BLEU vs. length to confirm TxtCTC helps short/medium but not long sentences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Full translation matrix evaluation:** Extending evaluation to the complete 10×10 combinations poses greater challenges and requires more computational resources. Future work will focus on scaling to more sign languages.

2. **Long sentence performance:** Can TxtCTC alignment be modified to maintain effectiveness for long, complex sentences where current CTC contribution diminishes?

3. **LID performance in simple settings:** Why does token-level SLI degrade performance in low-complexity settings (2-to-2 or 3-to-3) while improving it in high-complexity settings?

4. **Vocabulary bottleneck solutions:** What specific data augmentation techniques can effectively overcome the target vocabulary bottleneck in the many-to-one setting?

## Limitations

- Data scale severely constrained with only 8,300 training samples across 10 sign languages (~830 per language)
- Evaluation limited to three controlled sign language datasets without testing on real-world scenarios or diverse signing styles
- Exact SlowFastSign pre-training procedure and token-level LID labeling methodology not fully specified
- Model's absolute BLEU scores degrade significantly in many-to-many settings, suggesting limitations in true cross-lingual learning

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Core architectural contribution combining token-level SLI with TxtCTC is technically sound and addresses real problems in multilingual SLT
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical claims about token-level SLI mitigating language conflicts and TxtCTC benefits for short/medium sentences are supported but require more extensive testing
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about this representing a path toward "sign language foundation model" appear premature given limited data scale and evaluation scope

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study with realistic low-resource conditions:** Train on progressively smaller subsets of SP-10 (50%, 25%, 10%) to determine minimum viable data requirements and whether hierarchical CTC approach provides advantages under extreme data limitations.

2. **Cross-linguistic transfer analysis:** Systematically vary language pairs to include combinations with very different grammatical structures to measure performance degradation on structurally distant pairs.

3. **Real-world deployment validation:** Test on spontaneous signing data or sign language content from different domains (news, education, casual conversation) to assess robustness to signing style variations and domain shifts critical for practical deployment.
