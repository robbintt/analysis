# Learning to Trust Experience: A Monitor-Trust-Regulator Framework for Learning under Unobservable Feedback Reliability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09261

- Primary result: Self-diagnosis enables calibrated skepticism in RL with corrupted rewards (mean returns 854.4±103.3 vs baseline 804.6±136.6), but supervised learning shows performance recovery without epistemic recovery

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of epistemic identifiability under unobservable feedback reliability (EIUR), where autonomous agents must decide whether to learn from experiences without knowing their latent credibility. The authors propose a Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) framework that uses endogenous learning dynamics to assess experience reliability. They instantiate this framework with a self-diagnosis mechanism that maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable to modulate learning updates based on temporal coherence of internal learning signals.

Through experiments on HalfCheetah-v4 with corrupted rewards and supervised learning tasks, the study reveals a critical distinction between performance recovery and epistemic recovery. While the self-diagnosis mechanism enables agents to recover performance in reinforcement learning by learning to trust reliable experiences, supervised models can achieve high accuracy while remaining locked into misleading beliefs - demonstrating that performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. This work provides a metacognitive regulation abstraction for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning systems facing unobservable reliability.

## Method Summary
The Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) framework introduces metacognitive regulation for learning under unobservable feedback reliability. At its core, MTR uses endogenous learning dynamics as signals for reliability assessment rather than relying on external labels or explicit reliability indicators. The self-diagnosis instantiation maintains an experience-trust variable that evolves slowly over time, modulating learning updates based on the temporal coherence of internal learning signals. This allows the agent to assess whether experiences are internally consistent with its current understanding. In reinforcement learning settings, this enables calibrated skepticism toward corrupted experiences, while in supervised learning, it reveals the distinction between achieving accurate predictions and maintaining correct epistemic beliefs about the data.

## Key Results
- Self-diagnosis in MTR framework achieves mean returns of 854.4±103.3 on HalfCheetah-v4 with corrupted rewards, outperforming baseline PPO at 804.6±136.6
- RL experiments show clear recovery patterns where agents learn to trust only reliable experiences
- Supervised learning experiments reveal fundamental limitation: models can achieve high accuracy while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data
- Performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery, demonstrating the need for metacognitive regulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the temporal coherence of endogenous learning signals as a proxy for experience reliability. When an experience is reliable and consistent with the agent's current understanding, the learning updates should be coherent over time. Conversely, unreliable experiences produce inconsistent updates that can be detected through their temporal patterns. The self-diagnosis mechanism tracks these patterns through a slowly varying experience-trust variable, which modulates how much weight is given to each experience during learning. This creates a form of metacognitive regulation where the learning system can assess its own uncertainty about the reliability of its inputs without requiring external labels or explicit reliability indicators.

## Foundational Learning
- **Epistemic identifiability**: The ability to determine the reliability of feedback when reliability is not directly observable. Needed because most real-world learning involves uncertain or unreliable feedback without explicit reliability indicators.
- **Metacognitive regulation**: Using internal learning signals to regulate the learning process itself. Required because traditional approaches assume reliable feedback, which rarely holds in practice.
- **Temporal coherence**: The consistency of learning signals over time. Important because reliable experiences should produce coherent updates while unreliable ones create inconsistent patterns.
- **Performance vs epistemic recovery**: Distinguishing between achieving good predictions and maintaining correct understanding of data reliability. Critical because agents can appear successful while being fundamentally misinformed about data quality.
