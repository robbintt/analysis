# HiCaM: A Hierarchical-Causal Modification Framework for Long-Form Text Modification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.24319
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24319
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** HiCaM improves long-form text modification, achieving up to 79.50% win rate and 59.50% net win rate over strong baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HiCaM, a hierarchical-causal modification framework designed to address the challenges of long-form text modification (LTM). LTM involves updating long documents while maintaining logical coherence and avoiding undesired changes to implicitly related content. HiCaM uses a hierarchical summary tree and causal graph to guide entity-aware, logically coherent edits. The framework operates as a plug-and-play module, requiring no additional training, and shows consistent improvements across seven multi-domain benchmarks.

## Method Summary
HiCaM is a framework for long-form text modification that uses hierarchical summary trees and causal graphs to guide entity-aware edits. It extracts top-5 entities from modification suggestions, builds recursive summary trees to constrain modifications to relevant regions, and constructs causal graphs to propagate changes to logically connected content. The framework is implemented as a plug-and-play module that requires no additional training and operates on seven multi-domain benchmarks, achieving consistent improvements over strong baselines.

## Key Results
- HiCaM achieves up to 79.50% win rate and 59.50% net win rate over strong baselines.
- Performance gains are particularly notable on datasets with strong internal logical structure (e.g., MultiFieldQA-zh, QMSum).
- The framework shows consistent improvements across seven multi-domain benchmarks, including NarrativeQA, QuALITY, GOVREPORT, and QMSum.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical entity-oriented summary trees
- **Claim:** Constrains modifications to relevant text regions, reducing undesired alterations.
- **Core assumption:** Entity-centric segmentation aligns with human comprehension patterns and meaningful text boundaries.
- **Evidence anchors:** Hierarchical summary trees support precise modification control (abstract); weak corpus validation from neighbor papers on structural perturbation.
- **Break condition:** When text lacks clear entity boundaries or entity extraction fails.

### Mechanism 2: Causal graphs
- **Claim:** Captures implicit dependencies between entities, enabling propagation of modifications to logically connected content.
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can reliably extract causal relationships from text and these relationships transfer across chunks during merging.
- **Evidence anchors:** Causal graphs ensure modifications propagate properly (abstract); ~20% performance drop when removed from datasets requiring strong logical reasoning.
- **Break condition:** When texts have inherently weak logical structure.

### Mechanism 3: Top-k entity filtering with importance scoring
- **Claim:** Reduces noise while preserving modification-relevant entities.
- **Core assumption:** Importance scores correlate with modification relevance and LLM self-explanation improves entity identification.
- **Evidence anchors:** Top-5 achieves 70.66% win rate vs. 64.47% without filtering; top-3 drops to 66.84%.
- **Break condition:** Overly strict filtering removes important entities; no filtering introduces noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Hierarchical text segmentation
  - **Why needed here:** The summary tree requires recursive decomposition based on meaningful boundaries, not arbitrary token limits.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a 10,000-word document about multiple characters, how would you determine where one entity's "scope" ends and another begins?

- **Concept:** Causal relationship extraction
  - **Why needed here:** Building entity graphs requires distinguishing correlation from causation and directionality of influence.
  - **Quick check question:** In "A's departure caused B to assume control, which led to C's resentment," identify all directed edges and their labels.

- **Concept:** LLM-as-coordinator patterns
  - **Why needed here:** HiCaM uses LLMs for extraction, tree construction, graph building, and final modification—a multi-stage pipeline requiring prompt engineering.
  - **Quick check question:** How would prompt design differ for entity extraction vs. causal edge extraction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Text + Modification Suggestion → Chunking → Entity Extraction → Top-k filtering → Hierarchical Summary Tree + Causal Graph → Tree-Structured Modification Suggestions → Final Modified Text

- **Critical path:** Entity extraction → Tree/Graph construction → Modification suggestion generation. Errors in entity extraction propagate through entire pipeline.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Chunk size: Smaller (2048) = more tree nodes, more granular control but more LLM calls; larger (8192/no limit) = fewer nodes, faster but risk of summarization drift. Paper chose 4096 as middle ground.
  - Tree depth limit: Default 1 prevents excessive growth but may miss fine-grained entity sub-sections.
  - Top-k value: 5 balances noise reduction vs. entity retention; domain-dependent.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Output length plateau despite long input → model summarizing instead of modifying (check tree coverage)
  - Logical inconsistencies in output → causal graph not properly merged or edges missing
  - Unrelated content altered → tree segmentation failed to isolate entity boundaries
  - Computation cost 2-3x baseline → expected; mitigate with parallel chunk processing

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation on chunk size:** Run HiCaM on NarrativeQA with chunk sizes [2048, 4096, 8192, no_limit]. Measure win rate AND node count. Verify paper's finding that win rates stable but node counts vary significantly.
  2. **Causal graph contribution:** Run with and without causal graph on QuALITY (high logical structure) vs. GOVREPORT (weak structure). Confirm ~20% drop on QuALITY, minimal drop on GOVREPORT.
  3. **Entity filtering sensitivity:** Test top-k [3, 5, 10, none] on a single domain. Identify the knee point where filtering helps vs. hurts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can computational overhead (2-3x higher than standard generation) be reduced through architectural optimizations while maintaining modification quality?
- Does HiCaM generalize effectively to languages beyond English and Chinese, particularly morphologically rich or low-resource languages?
- Would semantic similarity-based chunking improve modification coherence compared to the current token-aware recursive splitting approach?
- How does the depth limit of the hierarchical summary tree affect modification quality, and what is the optimal depth for different document types?

## Limitations
- Computational overhead is approximately 2-3 times higher than standard generation methods due to multiple structured outputs during modification.
- Evaluation is primarily conducted on English datasets (7 out of 8), with only limited testing on Chinese.
- Prompt templates and operational definitions for key parameters (τ threshold, meaningful segmentation) are unspecified.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** HiCaM improves over baselines on multi-domain LTM tasks, with win rates up to 79.50% and net win rates up to 59.50%.
- **Medium confidence:** The hierarchical summary tree reduces undesired modifications by constraining changes to entity-relevant regions.
- **Low confidence:** The causal graph successfully captures and propagates implicit dependencies across the entire text.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on tree construction parameters:** Run HiCaM with varying depth limits (0, 1, 2) and τ thresholds on NarrativeQA. Measure win rates, tree node counts, and output length ratios.
2. **Causal graph accuracy audit:** For 50 randomly selected samples from MultiFieldQA-zh, manually evaluate extracted causal graphs for correctness, edge directionality, and completeness.
3. **Entity filtering sensitivity analysis:** Test HiCaM with k=[1, 3, 5, 10, 20] on QASPER dataset. Plot win rate against k to identify optimal filtering point.
