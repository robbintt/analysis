# A Graph-based Verification Framework for Fact-Checking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07282
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: GraphFC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3.75-8.31% macro-F1 improvements over existing methods

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses critical limitations in existing large language model-based fact-checking methods, particularly insufficient claim decomposition and mention ambiguity issues. The authors propose GraphFC, a novel graph-based framework that converts claims into structured graph representations using triplets. This approach systematically eliminates decomposition insufficiencies and resolves mention ambiguities through relational constraints. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark datasets, establishing GraphFC as a state-of-the-art solution for complex fact-checking tasks.

## Method Summary
GraphFC transforms fact-checking claims into graph structures where each claim is represented as a set of triplets, with subjects and objects as nodes connected by predicate relationships. The framework operates through three main components: graph construction using LLM-based triplet extraction, graph-guided planning for decomposition strategies, and graph-guided checking for verification. This graph-based approach addresses the fundamental limitations of traditional methods by providing structured representations that eliminate decomposition insufficiencies and resolve mention ambiguities through explicit relational constraints. The system demonstrates particular effectiveness for complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning.

## Key Results
- GraphFC achieves state-of-the-art performance with macro-F1 improvements of 3.75-8.31% over existing methods
- The framework shows consistent improvements across three benchmark datasets: HOVER, FEVEROUS, and SciFact
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the graph-based approach, particularly for complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The graph-based approach works by fundamentally restructuring how claims are represented and processed. Traditional fact-checking methods struggle with claim decomposition because they attempt to break down complex claims into simpler components without preserving relational context. GraphFC addresses this by converting claims into graph structures where triplets capture both entities and their relationships, ensuring that decomposition maintains semantic integrity. Additionally, mention ambiguity is resolved through explicit relational constraints encoded in the graph structure, preventing the confusion that arises when the same mention could refer to different entities or concepts. This structured representation enables more precise verification by maintaining the full context of relationships throughout the checking process.

## Foundational Learning

**Triplet Extraction**: Why needed - to convert natural language claims into structured graph representations; Quick check - verify that extracted triplets preserve the semantic meaning of the original claim

**Graph Construction**: Why needed - to create a structured representation that eliminates decomposition insufficiencies; Quick check - confirm that the graph maintains all relevant relationships and entities from the original claim

**Multi-hop Reasoning**: Why needed - to handle complex claims that require reasoning across multiple facts; Quick check - test the system's ability to connect disparate pieces of information through the graph structure

**Relational Constraints**: Why needed - to resolve mention ambiguities by explicitly encoding relationships; Quick check - verify that ambiguous mentions are correctly disambiguated based on their graph context

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph Construction -> Graph-Guided Planning -> Graph-Guided Checking

**Critical Path**: The system follows a sequential flow where raw claims enter graph construction, which then feeds into the planning module for decomposition strategy, and finally proceeds to the checking module for verification

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes accuracy through structured representation over computational efficiency, accepting the overhead of graph construction and maintenance for improved verification performance

**Failure Signatures**: The system may struggle with claims that contain implicit relationships not easily captured in triplet form, or with domain-specific terminology that the triplet extraction model cannot properly handle

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Evaluate GraphFC on simple single-hop claims to establish baseline performance
2. Test the framework on complex multi-hop claims requiring cross-document reasoning
3. Conduct ablation studies removing graph components to quantify their individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The graph construction approach relies heavily on LLM-based triplet extraction, which may introduce noise and inconsistencies, particularly for complex or domain-specific claims
- Evaluation focuses primarily on structured datasets with relatively clean input formats, limiting generalizability to real-world noisy claims
- Computational overhead of graph construction and maintenance is not thoroughly analyzed, particularly for large-scale deployment

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Core methodology effectiveness | High |
| Performance improvements on benchmark datasets | Medium |
| Ablation study validity | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset validation to assess performance consistency across different domains and claim structures beyond the three evaluated datasets
2. Perform thorough analysis of computational overhead and scalability, including time and resource requirements for graph construction and maintenance
3. Implement robustness testing with adversarial claims and noisy input data to evaluate real-world applicability and failure modes
