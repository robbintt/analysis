# Pi-GPS: Enhancing Geometry Problem Solving by Unleashing the Power of Diagrammatic Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05543
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05543
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Pi-GPS achieves nearly 10% improvement over prior neural-symbolic approaches on Geometry3K benchmark by resolving textual ambiguity through diagrammatic information

## Executive Summary
Pi-GPS addresses the critical challenge of textual ambiguity in geometry problem solving by integrating diagrammatic information into the reasoning process. The framework introduces a novel rectifier-verifier module that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to disambiguate text based on diagrammatic context, followed by verification to ensure geometric rule compliance. The approach also explores theorem prediction using disambiguated formal language. Experiments on Geometry3K and PGPS9K benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains, with Pi-GPS outperforming state-of-the-art models by nearly 10% on Geometry3K, highlighting the importance of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

## Method Summary
The Pi-GPS framework addresses geometry problem solving by tackling textual ambiguity through a two-stage rectifier-verifier module. The rectifier uses MLLMs to disambiguate problem text by incorporating diagrammatic information, resolving ambiguities that typically hinder multimodal reasoning. The verifier then ensures the rectified output adheres to geometric rules, reducing hallucinations. The framework also leverages disambiguated formal language for theorem prediction. By integrating diagrammatic context into the reasoning pipeline, Pi-GPS significantly improves performance on geometry benchmarks, demonstrating the critical role of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical problem solving.

## Key Results
- Pi-GPS achieves nearly 10% improvement over prior neural-symbolic approaches on Geometry3K benchmark
- Significant performance gains demonstrated on both Geometry3K and PGPS9K benchmarks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models in geometry problem solving through diagram-guided text disambiguation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Pi-GPS works by addressing the fundamental bottleneck of textual ambiguity in geometry problem solving. By incorporating diagrammatic information through the rectifier-verifier module, the framework resolves ambiguities that typically confuse multimodal reasoning systems. The rectifier uses MLLMs to interpret geometric context from diagrams, disambiguating problem statements, while the verifier ensures the rectified output maintains geometric validity. This two-stage approach effectively combines visual and textual reasoning, preventing hallucinations and improving theorem prediction accuracy through formal language processing of disambiguated text.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Why needed - to interpret and integrate diagrammatic information with text for disambiguation. Quick check - verify MLLM can accurately extract geometric entities and relationships from diagrams.
- Formal Language Theorem Prediction: Why needed - to ensure precise, unambiguous representation of geometric reasoning. Quick check - confirm theorem predictions align with established geometric principles.
- Rectifier-Verifier Architecture: Why needed - to separate disambiguation from validation, reducing error propagation. Quick check - test rectifier output for geometric consistency before verification.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Text Input -> Rectifier (MLLM) -> Verifier (Geometric Rules) -> Theorem Prediction (Formal Language) -> Output

Critical Path:
Text Input -> Rectifier -> Verifier -> Theorem Prediction -> Output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Uses MLLMs for disambiguation, inheriting potential model biases but leveraging strong multimodal reasoning capabilities
- Two-stage rectifier-verifier design adds computational overhead but improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations
- Formal language theorem prediction ensures precision but may limit handling of complex, informal geometric reasoning

Failure Signatures:
- Poor diagram quality leading to incorrect rectification
- Verifier rejecting valid but unconventional geometric interpretations
- Theorem prediction failures due to overly rigid formal language constraints

First Experiments:
1. Test rectifier performance on problems with varying degrees of textual ambiguity using controlled diagrams
2. Evaluate verifier's ability to catch geometric inconsistencies in rectified outputs
3. Compare theorem prediction accuracy between formal language and natural language approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Rectifier-verifier module may inherit MLLM-specific biases and hallucinations despite verification step
- Experimental improvements require independent replication to confirm generalizability
- Framework's performance impact from varying diagram quality and completeness remains unexplored

## Confidence
- High confidence in identifying textual ambiguity as critical bottleneck in geometry problem solving
- Medium confidence in rectifier-verifier architecture's effectiveness, pending independent validation
- Medium confidence in experimental results, given lack of detailed ablation studies and failure case analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of rectifier and verifier components to overall performance
2. Test framework's robustness across diagrams of varying quality and completeness to assess dependency on diagram fidelity
3. Implement cross-validation with independent geometry problem datasets to verify generalizability of reported improvements beyond Geometry3K and PGPS9K benchmarks
