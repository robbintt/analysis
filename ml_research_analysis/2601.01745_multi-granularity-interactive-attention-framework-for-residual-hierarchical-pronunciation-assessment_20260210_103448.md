# Multi-granularity Interactive Attention Framework for Residual Hierarchical Pronunciation Assessment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.01745
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01745
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** Proposed HIA framework achieves state-of-the-art pronunciation assessment performance, with PCC scores of 0.657 (phoneme accuracy), 0.436 (word stress), 0.628 (word total), and 0.764 (utterance total) on speechocean762 dataset.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-aspect multi-granularity pronunciation assessment by introducing the HIA framework, which features an interactive attention module and residual hierarchical structure. The framework captures linguistic features at different granularities (phoneme, word, utterance) while integrating bidirectional correlations between them. Extensive experiments on the speechocean762 dataset demonstrate that HIA outperforms existing methods across all evaluation metrics, particularly excelling at context-dependent aspects like word stress.

## Method Summary
HIA processes input speech through a multi-stage architecture beginning with acoustic feature extraction (LPP/LPR GOP features) and canonical phoneme embeddings. A Transformer encoder generates shared acoustic embeddings, which are then processed through an Interactive Attention Module that enables bidirectional interaction between phoneme, word, and utterance granularities. The framework employs residual connections to prevent feature forgetting during hierarchical processing, with 1-D convolutional layers enhancing local contextual cue extraction. The hierarchical structure predicts scores at phoneme, word (accuracy/stress/total), and utterance (fluency/prosody/total) levels, with aspect attention mechanisms at the word level.

## Key Results
- Achieves PCC of 0.657 for phoneme accuracy, outperforming baseline methods
- Reaches PCC of 0.436 for word stress, demonstrating effectiveness for context-dependent features
- Obtains PCC of 0.628 for word total assessment and 0.764 for utterance total
- Shows consistent improvements across all metrics compared to existing pronunciation assessment frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Bidirectional interaction between phoneme, word, and utterance granularities improves assessment performance, specifically for context-dependent features like word stress.
- **Mechanism:** The Interactive Attention Module concatenates query vectors from all three granularity levels ($Q_{phn}, Q_{word}, Q_{utt}$) into a single set ($Q$). By applying self-attention to this combined set, the model allows lower-level features (phonemes) to attend to higher-level context (utterances) and vice versa, rather than strictly following a phoneme $\rightarrow$ word $\rightarrow$ utterance flow.
- **Core assumption:** Linguistic features at different granularities are not independent; specifically, word stress is contextually dependent on the utterance, and this dependency is bidirectional.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...leverages attention mechanisms to achieve dynamic bidirectional interaction... effectively capturing linguistic features at each granularity while integrating correlations..."
  - [section]: "For the first time, we introduce an Interactive Attention Module that jointly encodes all pairwise bidirectional interaction within a single self-attention operation..." (Methodology, Page 3).
  - [corpus]: MuFFIN (arxiv 2510.04956) supports the efficacy of "Interactive Hierarchical Neural Modeling" for multifaceted pronunciation feedback, validating the interactive approach.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset consists of isolated, context-free utterances where no prosodic variation exists, the bidirectional attention mechanism may overfit to noise rather than linguistic structure.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Residual connections from the initial acoustic embeddings prevent the "feature forgetting" problem as the network depth increases through the hierarchy.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of only passing the output of one granularity level to the next (e.g., phoneme score to word level), the model re-injects the raw acoustic embedding ($X$) from the Transformer encoder at every subsequent level (Word and Utterance). The input to the word level is calculated as $X_{word} = X + S_{phn} + H_{word}$.
- **Core assumption:** Hierarchical processing tends to dilute or distort the raw acoustic signal information as it propagates through layers of abstraction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...residual hierarchical structure is proposed to alleviate the feature forgetting problem when modeling acoustic hierarchies."
  - [section]: "HIA optimizes the hierarchical structure using a residual connection... introducing acoustic embeddings from the Transformer encoder when modeling the target granularity" (Methodology, Page 4).
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence for residual connections specifically in this hierarchy is weak; general support for residual learning exists in "Cardioformer" (arxiv 2505.05538) regarding multi-granularity patching, but it is domain-distinct.
- **Break condition:** If the initial Transformer encoder ($X$) produces low-quality embeddings (e.g., due to domain mismatch), the residual connections will propagate these errors through all subsequent levels.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** 1-D convolutional layers at each granularity level enhance the extraction of local contextual cues, improving score prediction.
- **Mechanism:** After the attention and residual summation steps, the feature map is passed through a 1-D convolutional layer before the final regression head. This captures local sequential patterns (e.g., phoneme transitions) that might be smoothed out by global attention mechanisms.
- **Core assumption:** Local temporal dependencies (e.g., the relationship between adjacent phonemes or words) are critical predictors of pronunciation quality and are not fully captured by the Transformer's global attention.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "...use 1-D convolutional layers to enhance the extraction of local contextual cues at each granularity."
  - [section]: "...convolutional layer... further extracts and refines the phoneme-level features by learning the characteristic patterns of local regions" (Methodology, Page 4).
  - [corpus]: Explicit corpus support for Conv1D in this specific architecture is weak; related works like Gradformer (cited in paper) use convolution-enhanced Transformers, aligning with the method.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset is extremely small (the paper notes dataset limitations), adding convolutional layers increases parameter count and optimization difficulty, potentially leading to overfitting.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Self-Attention vs. Cross-Attention**
  - **Why needed here:** The Interactive Attention Module relies on distinguishing between Self-Attention (granularities interacting with each other) and Cross-Attention (granularities querying the raw acoustic features).
  - **Quick check question:** In the Interactive Attention Module, which operation mixes the phoneme and utterance query vectors, and which operation grounds them back to the audio features?

- **Concept:** **Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the primary input feature (LPP and LPR). Understanding that it represents the log-posterior probability of a phoneme given the audio is essential for understanding what the Transformer encoder is actually processing.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the model use LPR (Log Posterior Ratio) in addition to LPP (Log Phone Posterior) when constructing the input features?

- **Concept:** **Residual Connections (Skip Connections)**
  - **Why needed here:** The "Residual Hierarchical Structure" is a core contribution. One must understand how adding the input $X$ to the output of a layer helps preserve the original signal magnitude and gradient flow.
  - **Quick check question:** In the Word-level modeling equation $X_{word} = X + S_{phn} + H_{word}$, what would happen to the acoustic information from $X$ if the weights of the intermediate layers became very large?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Acoustic Front-end (LPP/LPR GOP features) -> Transformer Encoder (generates $X$) -> Interactive Attention Module (generates $H_{phn}, H_{word}, H_{utt}$) -> Hierarchical Decoders (Phoneme, Word, Utterance levels)

- **Critical path:** The **Interactive Attention Module** is the most critical novelty. If this module fails to generate meaningful query vectors, the bidirectional interaction collapses, reducing the model to a standard hierarchical uni-directional system. The reliance on $S_{phn}$ for $X_{word}$ input means phoneme scoring accuracy is also a bottleneck for higher levels.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  -   **Single-head vs. Multi-head attention:** The paper (Table 5) selects 1 head for self/cross-attention. This trades potential representation richness for lower parameter count to prevent overfitting on the limited dataset.
  -   **Parallel vs. Sequential Scoring:** While the attention module is parallel-friendly, the hierarchical structure (feeding $S_{word}$ into Utterance modeling) forces a sequential dependency, potentially increasing inference latency.

- **Failure signatures:**
  -   **Low Word Stress PCC:** If the Interactive Attention Module is ablated or under-trained, Word Stress PCC drops significantly (e.g., from 0.436 to 0.335 in ablations), as this metric relies heavily on context.
  -   **Overfitting on Utterance Completeness:** The paper notes the dataset has a distribution bias (4975/5000 sentences have a perfect completeness score of 10). The model may struggle to learn meaningful gradients for this specific aspect.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1.  **Interactive Head Ablation:** Run inference with only the residual hierarchical structure (remove $H_{phn}, H_{word}, H_{utt}$) to quantify the precise contribution of the bidirectional interaction (expected drop in Stress/Prosody).
  2.  **Convolutional Layer Sweep:** Vary the number of Conv1D layers (0, 1, 2) to verify the "local context" hypothesis and check for the optimization difficulties mentioned in the paper.
  3.  **Embedding Size Scaling:** Test embedding sizes of 24 vs. 48 vs. 96 to confirm if the performance drop at 96 is due to dataset size constraints (overfitting) rather than model capacity issues.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the HIA framework maintain performance improvements when scaling to larger model capacities and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the ablation study that "the dataset is not large enough and the increased parameters are difficult to optimize," noting performance drops when increasing embedding sizes or convolutional layers.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the current performance ceiling is due to the model architecture or simply the limited size of the speechocean762 dataset restricting optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on larger-scale L2 speech corpora demonstrating monotonic improvements with increased embedding dimensions and deeper attention layers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the severe label imbalance in the speechocean762 dataset affect the model's ability to learn robust completeness features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes the model fails to beat human experts on utterance-level completeness, attributing this to a distributional bias where 4975 out of 5000 sentences have a score of 10.
- Why unresolved: It is undetermined whether the model's lower performance on completeness is a failure of feature extraction or a result of the model converging on the majority class.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on a dataset with a balanced distribution of completeness scores or applying data augmentation/re-sampling techniques to the current set.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the HIA architecture be adapted for open-response pronunciation assessment scenarios without relying on pre-specified text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The Related Work section reviews "open-response" assessment, but the proposed HIA framework is validated exclusively on "read-aloud" tasks using forced alignment and canonical phoneme embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on GOP features and canonical inputs that presuppose the text is known; applying this to spontaneous speech requires modifying or removing these dependencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating an ASR module to generate dynamic phoneme sequences or using ASR-free input features, tested on an open-response benchmark.

## Limitations

- **Dataset size and composition:** The speechocean762 dataset contains only 5000 utterances, with a strong bias toward perfect completeness scores (4975/5000 at score=10). This limited diversity may inflate performance metrics and hinder generalization to more challenging or varied speech.
- **Feature extraction dependencies:** The model relies heavily on GOP features extracted via a Librispeech acoustic model. If the forced alignment or GOP extraction introduces noise or systematic errors, this will propagate through all downstream components.
- **Architectural complexity and overfitting risk:** The Interactive Attention Module introduces multiple novel components. While ablations show performance drops when these are removed, it is difficult to isolate the contribution of each component, and the model is sensitive to hyperparameter choices.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The residual hierarchical structure effectively alleviates feature forgetting, as evidenced by the consistent performance improvements across all metrics and the clear ablation results showing drops without it.
- **Medium confidence:** The bidirectional interaction mechanism significantly improves context-dependent metrics (e.g., word stress), but the exact contribution of each sub-component within the Interactive Attention Module is difficult to quantify.
- **Low confidence:** The model's ability to generalize to diverse speech samples outside the speechocean762 dataset, given its size and composition bias.

## Next Checks

1. **Interactive Attention Ablation:** Systematically remove the Interactive Attention Module and retrain the model to quantify the precise performance drop in context-dependent metrics (word stress, utterance fluency/prosody).
2. **Dataset Diversity Test:** Evaluate the model on a subset of speechocean762 with lower completeness scores (e.g., scores <8) to assess its ability to learn meaningful gradients for challenging utterances.
3. **Generalization Benchmark:** Test the model on an external pronunciation assessment dataset (e.g., L2-ARCTIC or another publicly available corpus) to validate its generalization beyond the training domain.
