## Executive Summary
PerfGuard introduces a performance-aware agent framework that systematically models tool performance boundaries to improve task planning and execution in visual content generation. Unlike existing frameworks that rely on generic textual descriptions, PerfGuard introduces three core mechanisms: Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM) which replaces textual descriptions with multi-dimensional scoring based on fine-grained performance evaluations; Adaptive Preference Updating (APU) which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical and actual execution rankings; and Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO) which guides planners to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across multiple metrics including color (87.53% vs 84.82%), spatial (61.20% vs 54.37%), and complex (50.07% vs 44.99%) dimensions.

## Method Summary
PerfGuard addresses limitations in current visual content generation frameworks by introducing a systematic approach to modeling tool performance boundaries. The framework implements three key mechanisms: Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM) that uses multi-dimensional scoring based on fine-grained performance evaluations instead of textual descriptions; Adaptive Preference Updating (APU) that dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical and actual execution rankings; and Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO) that guides planners to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. This systematic approach enables more accurate tool selection and improved execution of complex visual generation tasks.

## Key Results
- Tool selection error rate: 14.2% (PerfGuard) vs 77.8% (text-based methods)
- Color dimension accuracy: 87.53% (PerfGuard) vs 84.82% (competitors)
- Spatial dimension accuracy: 61.20% (PerfGuard) vs 54.37% (competitors)
- Complex dimension accuracy: 50.07% (PerfGuard) vs 44.99% (competitors)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PerfGuard works by replacing generic textual descriptions with fine-grained, multi-dimensional performance evaluations of available tools. The system continuously updates its understanding of tool capabilities through actual execution feedback, creating a dynamic preference system that improves over time. By aligning planning optimization with these performance-aware strategies, the framework ensures that subtasks are generated with appropriate tool selection in mind from the outset.

## Foundational Learning
- **Performance-aware selection modeling**: Understanding tool capabilities through multi-dimensional scoring rather than textual descriptions. Why needed: Traditional text-based approaches lack precision in tool capability representation. Quick check: Verify that performance metrics capture relevant dimensions for visual generation tasks.
- **Dynamic preference updating**: System learns from execution outcomes to refine future tool selections. Why needed: Static tool selection strategies cannot adapt to varying task complexities. Quick check: Monitor preference update convergence across different task types.
- **Capability-aligned planning**: Planners generate subtasks with performance-aware strategies in mind. Why needed: Traditional planners often ignore tool-specific performance characteristics. Quick check: Validate that planned subtasks align with actual tool capabilities.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Instruction -> Task Decomposition -> PASM -> Tool Selection -> Execution -> APU Feedback -> CAPO Planning -> Output
- **Critical path**: The core workflow flows from task decomposition through performance-aware selection to execution, with continuous feedback loops for preference updating and planning optimization.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Prioritizes accuracy over speed by implementing detailed performance evaluations, accepting additional computational overhead for improved selection precision.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor tool selection when performance metrics don't capture relevant task dimensions; planning failures when capability alignment is misaligned with actual tool constraints.
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Compare tool selection accuracy between PASM and text-based approaches on standardized tasks; 2) Measure convergence rate of APU under varying task complexities; 3) Evaluate CAPO's impact on planning efficiency compared to baseline planners.
