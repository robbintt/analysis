- First comprehensive evaluation suite for African-accented English ASR across 7 domains and 100+ accents

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AfriSpeech-MultiBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating African-accented English ASR across seven domains (Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities, and Hallucination Robustness) covering over 100 accents from 10+ African countries. The authors benchmark 19 modern ASR systems including open-source models (Whisper variants, Parakeet, conformer-based models), Speech-LLMs, and proprietary cloud services on 79 hours of speech data. Results show that global ASR benchmarks like LibriSpeech do not predict performance on African accents, with WERs typically 2-5× higher on African data. While open-source models excel in spontaneous speech, they degrade on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are accent-robust but struggle with named entities; proprietary models perform well on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Regionally-tuned models like Intron-Sahara V2 achieve the best overall performance (average WER ~15%) across all domains and accents, demonstrating the value of accent-specific training. The benchmark reveals systematic performance gaps for African accents, with West African accents showing 30% WER versus ~24% for East and North African accents.

## Method Summary
The AfriSpeech-MultiBench suite evaluates 19 ASR systems (open-source, Speech-LLMs, and proprietary models) on 79 hours of African-accented English speech across 7 domains using zero-shot evaluation. The dataset includes 20,093 samples from 11 countries with 108 accents, organized into 7 corpora including AfriSpeech-200, AfriSpeech-Dialog, Med-Conv-Nig, and others. Models are tested on clean, conversational, noisy, and named-entity-rich speech, with WER computed using JIWER after three-stage transcript normalization (lowercase, filler removal, number word to digit mapping). Evaluation runs on a single T4 GPU with model-specific preprocessing (16kHz mono for NeMo models) and default hyperparameters.

## Key Results
- Global ASR benchmarks systematically overestimate African-accented speech performance by 2-5×
- Regionally-tuned models like Intron-Sahara V2 achieve best overall performance (average WER ~15%) across all domains and accents
- West African accents show 30% WER versus ~24% for East and North African accents
- Open-source models excel in spontaneous speech but degrade on noisy, non-native dialogue

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Global ASR benchmarks systematically overestimate African-accented speech performance by 2-5×. Standard benchmarks (LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM) use read, clean, North-American/British English. African speech introduces accent-driven phonetic variation, code-switching, and out-of-vocabulary proper nouns that these benchmarks do not stress-test. Leaderboard rankings therefore mask deployment-relevant errors. Core assumption: Performance correlates with acoustic and lexical similarity between training and test distributions. Evidence anchors: global ASR benchmarks like LibriSpeech do not predict performance on African accents, with WERs typically 2-5× higher; leading open-source systems like Parakeet-tdt-0.6B-v2 and Whisper-large-v3, which achieve sub-4% WER on LibriSpeech, experience error rates between 30-45% on general African speech. Break condition: If a model's training data includes substantial African-accented English with domain-specific vocabulary, benchmark gap should narrow.

### Mechanism 2
Regional fine-tuning on accent-diverse data compensates for model scale advantages. Models trained or fine-tuned on African English (e.g., Intron-Sahara V2) learn accent-specific phoneme mappings and localized lexicons. This targeted exposure outweighs parameter-count advantages of larger globally-trained models for in-domain inference. Core assumption: Accent robustness is learned through exposure, not emergent from scale alone. Evidence anchors: Intron-Sahara V2 achieves WERs below 15% across all benchmarked domains, outperforming all other models by a wide margin. Break condition: If larger SpeechLLMs (3-5B parameters) were fine-tuned on equivalent African data, they should match or exceed Sahara V2.

### Mechanism 3
Architecture families exhibit distinct failure signatures across accent-domain combinations. Conformer/RNN-T models encode acoustic features tightly and generalize well to spontaneous speech but lack robustness to noise and non-native pronunciation. SpeechLLMs leverage language priors for accent robustness but hallucinate on low-context named entities. Proprietary cloud models optimize for clean, formal speech and degrade on conversational overlap and domain-specific vocabulary. Core assumption: Architectural inductive biases (acoustic vs. linguistic grounding) create trade-offs that manifest differently across stress tests. Evidence anchors: open-source ASR models excel in spontaneous speech contexts but degrade on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; medical domain: Canary-1B-flash (conformer) achieves 78.92% WER on Med.Conv vs. Whisper-large-v3 at 31.76%. Break condition: Hybrid architectures (e.g., Canary-Qwen combining conformer encoder with LLM decoder) should show intermediate profiles.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Word Error Rate (WER)** = (Substitutions + Deletions + Insertions) / Reference Words. Why needed here: All benchmark comparisons use WER. Understanding that deletions (missed words) and insertions (hallucinations) are penalized equally is critical for interpreting noise robustness results. Quick check question: If a model outputs "transfer five hundred dollars" for reference "transfer $500", what error types occur?

- **Concept: Zero-shot evaluation** (no domain-specific fine-tuning or few-shot demonstrations). Why needed here: All 19 models are evaluated zero-shot. This tests out-of-box generalization but may underrepresent what's achievable with adaptation. Quick check question: Why might zero-shot WER be higher for SpeechLLMs than conformers even if SpeechLLMs have stronger language priors?

- **Concept: Accent clusters and phonological variation** (West African ~30% WER vs. East/North African ~24%). Why needed here: Performance varies by accent region, not just domain. West African accents (Nigeria, Ghana) show systematic degradation across all models, suggesting shared phonetic features that current models underfit. Quick check question: If deploying in Kenya vs. Nigeria, would you expect the same model ranking? (Check Table 6 first.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input audio → Model-specific preprocessing (16kHz mono for NeMo) → Inference → 3-stage normalization (lowercase, filler removal, number word→digit) → WER computation

- **Critical path**: Select domain subset from Hugging Face collection → Run inference with target model using specified prompts → Apply identical normalization to reference and hypothesis → Compute WER; disaggregate by country/accent for failure analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Conformer (Parakeet, Canary): Fast inference (0.6-1.1B params), strong on spontaneous speech, weak on named entities and noise
  - Whisper variants: Balanced performance, distilled versions faster but slightly less accurate
  - SpeechLLMs (Granite, Voxtral, Phi-4): Accent-robust but high hallucination rates on medical/financial domains; larger size doesn't guarantee better results
  - Proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini, Azure): Variable by country; GPT-4o shows 60%+ WER on Ghana vs. 15% on Uganda

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Named entities: >40% WER across most models; anglicization of African names
  - Conversational medical speech: 50-130% WER for SpeechLLMs
  - Silence/short utterances: High false-trigger rates; Phi-4 reaches 122.45% WER on robustness subset
  - West African accents: Systematic 5-10% WER penalty vs. East/North African

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Domain stress test**: Run Whisper-large-v3 on Medical vs. Finance vs. Named Entities subsets; quantify where WER exceeds 30% and inspect error types (substitution vs. deletion patterns)
  2. **Accent stratification**: Evaluate your target model on Nigeria vs. Kenya vs. South Africa splits; if variance >10%, consider accent-specific fine-tuning or ensembling
  3. **Noise robustness check**: Test on Silence and Short Speech subsets; if model outputs non-empty transcripts for silence clips, add voice activity detection pre-filter

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark relies on 79 hours of data, which is relatively modest for covering full linguistic diversity of African English
- Private Afro-Call-Centers subset prevents full reproducibility
- Proprietary models limit transparency into architectural details and training procedures
- Zero-shot evaluation only; adaptation potential through fine-tuning or few-shot prompting remains unexplored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Global ASR benchmarks systematically overestimate African-accented speech performance by 2-5×
- **Medium Confidence**: Regional fine-tuning on accent-diverse data compensates for model scale advantages
- **Medium Confidence**: Architecture families exhibit distinct failure signatures across accent-domain combinations

## Next Checks
1. **Fine-tuning Impact Study**: Take a large SpeechLLM (3-5B parameters) and fine-tune it on a subset of African-accented data from the AfriSpeech corpus. Compare zero-shot vs. fine-tuned WER across domains to quantify adaptation gains relative to Intron-Sahara V2.

2. **Accent Cluster Disaggregation**: Using the 11-country splits, perform a per-country WER breakdown for each model. Test whether performance correlates with specific phonological features rather than geographic region alone.

3. **Domain-Specific Adaptation**: Select one high-error domain (e.g., Medical) and create a small in-domain adaptation set (~100 utterances) from the held-out data. Fine-tune a baseline model (e.g., Whisper-large-v3) and measure WER reduction compared to zero-shot performance.
