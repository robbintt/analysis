# Multi-modal Bayesian Neural Network Surrogates with Conjugate Last-Layer Estimation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21711
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21711
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Multi-modal BNN surrogates with conjugate last-layer estimation improve prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification for heterogeneous data sources

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two Bayesian neural network-based surrogate models designed to handle multi-modal data for applications like optimization and sensitivity analysis. The core innovation is leveraging conditionally conjugate distributions in the last layer of the network, enabling efficient variational inference even with partially missing observations. The authors propose a joint model that outputs all modalities together and a layered model that uses auxiliary modalities as inputs to predict the main quantity of interest. Both models are implemented using Pyro and tested on diverse datasets including scalar functions, time series, and wind data. Results show that the layered model consistently reduces prediction bias, especially for out-of-sample points, while maintaining well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. The canonical correlation between modalities was found to be a useful indicator of potential performance gains.

## Method Summary
The authors develop multi-modal Bayesian neural network surrogates by exploiting conditionally conjugate distributions in the final layer, which enables efficient variational inference. Two architectures are proposed: a joint model that simultaneously predicts all output modalities, and a layered model that uses auxiliary modalities as additional inputs to predict the primary quantity of interest. Both models handle missing data naturally through the probabilistic framework. The layered model, in particular, shows improved out-of-sample performance by leveraging correlations between modalities. Implementation is carried out using the Pyro probabilistic programming framework, with training via stochastic variational inference. The approach is validated across diverse datasets including synthetic scalar functions, time series, and real-world wind data.

## Key Results
- The layered model consistently reduces prediction bias compared to the joint model, especially for out-of-sample predictions
- Canonical correlation between modalities serves as a useful indicator for potential performance improvements
- Both models maintain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates while improving prediction accuracy over standard uni-modal BNNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from exploiting conditional conjugacy in the last layer, which allows for efficient variational inference without sacrificing the ability to handle multi-modal outputs. By structuring the network to either jointly model all modalities or use auxiliary modalities as inputs, the framework captures complex dependencies between different data sources. The layered approach is particularly effective because it explicitly models the relationship between auxiliary and target modalities, reducing prediction bias when the modalities are correlated. The probabilistic framework naturally handles missing data, making it robust to incomplete observations common in real-world scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Neural Networks** - Probabilistic neural networks that maintain uncertainty estimates throughout predictions; needed for quantifying prediction confidence in surrogate modeling
- **Variational Inference** - Approximation method for Bayesian inference that scales to large datasets; needed to make posterior inference tractable in neural networks
- **Conditional Conjugacy** - Property where posterior distributions belong to the same family as priors given observed data; needed for computational efficiency in the last layer
- **Multi-modal Data** - Datasets containing multiple types or sources of information; needed to model complex systems with heterogeneous measurements
- **Canonical Correlation** - Statistical measure of linear relationship between two sets of variables; needed to quantify potential benefits of multi-modal modeling

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input -> Encoder Layers -> Latent Representation -> Last Layer (Conjugate) -> Output Modalities

**Critical Path:**
Data preprocessing -> Network encoding -> Conjugate last layer transformation -> Variational inference optimization

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Joint model: Simpler architecture but may struggle with modality-specific patterns
- Layered model: More complex but better exploits modality relationships
- Conjugate last layer: Computationally efficient but may limit flexibility

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor canonical correlation between modalities suggests limited benefit from multi-modal approach
- High uncertainty predictions indicate regions where the surrogate lacks confidence
- Systematic bias in predictions suggests model misspecification

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Train joint model on synthetic dataset with known modality correlations
2. Compare layered vs joint model on time series data with auxiliary measurements
3. Evaluate uncertainty calibration on out-of-sample wind data predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Conditionally conjugate distributions in the last layer may restrict model flexibility for highly non-linear relationships
- Performance gains depend on meaningful correlations between modalities, which may not always exist
- Current implementation in Pyro may limit scalability to extremely large datasets or real-time applications

## Confidence
- **High:** Prediction accuracy improvements over standard uni-modal BNNs
- **High:** Uncertainty quantification quality and calibration
- **Medium:** Canonical correlation as predictor of performance gains
- **Low:** Long-term scalability assertions for extremely large datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on high-dimensional datasets with hundreds of input features to evaluate scalability
2. Compare performance against state-of-the-art Gaussian process surrogates in computationally intensive engineering applications
3. Evaluate the models' ability to handle streaming data with evolving distributions over time
