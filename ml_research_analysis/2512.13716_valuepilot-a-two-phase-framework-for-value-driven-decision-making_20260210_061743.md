# ValuePilot: A Two-Phase Framework for Value-Driven Decision-Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13716
- Authors: Yitong Luo; Ziang Chen; Hou Hei Lam; Jiayu zhan; Junqi Wang; Zhenliang Zhang; Xue Feng
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieved 73.16% order-sensitive similarity with human decisions and 46.14% first-action accuracy, significantly outperforming strong LLM baselines including GPT-5 and Claude-Sonnet-4

## Executive Summary
ValuePilot addresses the challenge of personalized decision-making in AI by explicitly modeling human values rather than task-oriented goals. It introduces a two-phase framework: DGT generates value-annotated decision scenarios through a human-LLM collaborative pipeline, while DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences using a Value Assessment Network and PROMETHEE-based multi-criteria decision-making. The framework demonstrates that value-driven decision-making enables interpretable, generalizable, and personalized AI behavior.

## Method Summary
ValuePilot operates through a two-phase approach. The Dataset Generation Toolkit (DGT) creates scenarios where each action receives continuous scores (-1 to +1) across six value dimensions (Curiosity, Energy, Security, Happiness, Intimacy, Fairness). The Decision-Making Module (DMM) uses a Value Assessment Network to predict objective value scores from text, then applies user preference vectors through contextualized scoring before PROMETHEE aggregation. This modular design allows personalization without retraining by separating objective value assessment from subjective preference integration.

## Key Results
- DMM achieved 73.16% order-sensitive similarity with human decisions
- DMM achieved 46.14% first-action accuracy, outperforming strong LLM baselines
- PROMETHEE-based pairwise comparison achieved 73.16% OS-Sim vs. 68.19% (TOPSIS) and 67.08% (MAUT)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explicit value annotation creates a learnable mapping from scenarios and actions to value dimensions.
- Mechanism: DGT generates scenarios where each action receives continuous scores (-1 to +1) across predefined value dimensions. This transforms implicit value judgments into structured supervision signals for the Value Assessment Network.
- Core assumption: Values can be meaningfully quantified on a bipolar scale and remain consistent across annotators.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline."
  - [section 2.1] "Each action in our dataset is accompanied by a score ranging from −1 to +1 on each dimension."
  - [corpus] Related work (GRACE) emphasizes neuro-symbolic reasoning for alignment but does not provide comparable annotation pipelines.
- Break condition: If value annotations lack inter-annotator consistency or fail to capture context-dependent value expression, supervision quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Disentangling objective value assessment from subjective preference integration enables personalization without retraining.
- Mechanism: The Value Assessment Network learns to predict objective value scores from text. Separately, user preference vectors transform these scores through contextualized scoring before PROMETHEE aggregation. This modular design allows new users to be added by providing preference vectors alone.
- Core assumption: Objective value implications of actions can be separated from how much a user cares about each dimension.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences."
  - [section 3.2.1] "The Contextualized Scoring stage takes two primary inputs: (1) the user's value preference vector p... (2) the objective score ρ output by the Value Assessment Network."
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighbor papers focus on desire alignment but not modular disentanglement.
- Break condition: If actions inherently encode subjective values (e.g., cultural norms) that cannot be separated from objective assessment, the modular approach introduces systematic bias.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PROMETHEE-based pairwise comparison handles multi-dimensional value trade-offs more effectively than direct scoring.
- Mechanism: Rather than aggregating scores directly, PROMETHEE computes preference degrees between action pairs per dimension, then aggregates weighted preferences, finally ranking by net outranking flow. This captures dominance relationships rather than absolute utility.
- Core assumption: Pairwise preference relationships are more stable and interpretable than absolute value aggregation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2] "We apply PROMETHEE... suitable for its outranking principle in handling complex trade-offs."
  - [appendix D.2, Table 7] PROMETHEE achieves 73.16% OS-Sim vs. 68.19% (TOPSIS) and 67.08% (MAUT).
  - [corpus] No direct comparison in related work; this is a novel integration claim.
- Break condition: If many actions are incomparable (no clear dominance), the outranking flow produces unstable rankings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Schwartz's Basic Human Values Theory**
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical grounding for selecting value dimensions and their distinctness claims.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Curiosity and Security might conflict in a given scenario?

- Concept: **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)**
  - Why needed here: Core to understanding why PROMETHEE was chosen over simpler aggregation methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between outranking methods and utility-based methods in MCDM?

- Concept: **Curriculum Learning**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses curriculum learning to train the Value Assessment Network, progressively increasing complexity.
  - Quick check question: Why might training on single-dimension scenarios before multi-dimension scenarios improve generalization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **DGT (Dataset Generation Toolkit)**: Task Specifier → GPT-4 scenario generation → automatic filtering → human review
  - **Value Assessment Network**: T5-base encoder → multi-head attention → MLP → tanh output ([-1, 1] per dimension)
  - **Action Selection Module**: Contextualized Scoring (sigmoid-transformed preferences + discrepancy scoring) → PROMETHEE ranking

- Critical path:
  1. Define value dimensions relevant to your domain
  2. Run DGT to generate annotated scenarios (budget for human review time)
  3. Train Value Assessment Network with curriculum learning (order: [6,1,5,2,4,3] worked best)
  4. Elicit user preference vectors (0-1 scale per dimension)
  5. Apply Action Selection Module at inference time

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **w parameter (subjective vs. objective weight)**: Paper uses w=0.3; higher values prioritize user preference alignment over objective value scores. Adjust based on whether your application values consistency (lower w) or personalization (higher w).
  - **Encoder choice**: T5-base slightly outperforms BERT/RoBERTa (0.66-1.25% difference), but framework is encoder-agnostic. Use smaller encoders for latency-constrained applications.
  - **Number of candidate actions**: PROMETHEE requires O(n²) pairwise comparisons. Paper uses 10 actions per scenario; scaling to 50+ actions may require approximation.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Low OS-Sim with high First-Acc**: Model captures top choice but not ranking structure → check PROMETHEE weight calibration
  - **Value Assessment Network MAE > 0.3**: Insufficient training data or poor scenario diversity → expand DGT coverage
  - **Ablation showing "w/o Preference" ≈ Full DMM**: User preference elicitation may be capturing noise → validate preference questionnaire design

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate value recognition baseline**: Train Value Assessment Network on the 6-D dataset split (80/20), compare MAE against Gemini-1.5-flash. Target: MAE < 0.20 (paper achieves 0.19).
  2. **Ablate the subjective weight w**: Run DMM with w ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0} on held-out test scenarios. Expect peak alignment around w=0.3-0.5 for domestic scenarios.
  3. **Pilot human study (n=10)**: Collect value preference vectors and action rankings for 5 new scenarios not in training set. Compare DMM vs. GPT-4o-mini using OS-Sim. Target: DMM > baseline by 3%+ OS-Sim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: Can ValuePilot's performance generalize to domains beyond domestic scenarios and to more diverse demographic populations?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the demographic sample is "skewed toward younger, educated, urban populations" and that "broader generalizability to rural or less-educated groups requires confirmation through targeted sampling in future studies." The experiments focus exclusively on domestic scenarios.
  - Why unresolved: The current evaluation is limited to 40 human subjects with specific demographic characteristics and a single domain (domestic environments), leaving domain transfer and population-level generalization untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results on non-domestic scenarios (healthcare, workplace, education) and studies with demographically diverse participant samples showing comparable OS-Sim and First-Acc metrics.

- **Question**: Would more sophisticated psychometric techniques for value preference elicitation improve alignment accuracy compared to direct rating scales?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Limitations section acknowledges: "the method currently employed for eliciting user value preferences relies on direct rating scales. Although practical, this approach may fall short in capturing the nuanced and relative importance of individual values as effectively as more sophisticated psychometric techniques could."
  - Why unresolved: Direct 0-to-1 rating scales may not capture relative value trade-offs, contextual variation, or hierarchical value structures that humans naturally employ.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using established psychometric methods (e.g., pairwise comparisons, ranking-based elicitation) against direct ratings, measuring resulting decision alignment improvements.

- **Question**: How does the framework's performance scale with increasing numbers of value dimensions beyond the current six?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The dataset uses exactly six dimensions, and while the framework is described as "extensible," no experiments test performance degradation or computational costs as dimensions increase. The hierarchical dataset architecture (Table 3) tests 1-D through 6-D, but not beyond.
  - Why unresolved: PROMETHEE's pairwise comparison complexity grows quadratically with actions, and preference integration may become noisy with more dimensions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with expanded value dimension sets (10, 15, 20+), reporting both alignment accuracy and computational efficiency metrics.

- **Question**: Can ValuePilot capture temporal dynamics in user value preferences that shift across contexts or over time?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework treats value preferences as static vectors provided once per user. Schwartz's theory (cited) describes values as "relatively stable," but human decision-making studies show contextual variability. The current design assumes a single preference vector per person.
  - Why unresolved: No mechanism exists for detecting or adapting to context-dependent value shifts (e.g., safety prioritization during emergencies vs. routine situations).
  - What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking the same users across varied contexts, measuring whether context-aware preference updating improves alignment over static preferences.

## Limitations
- Reliance on human-LLM collaboration for dataset generation introduces potential biases from both LLM's value judgments and human annotators' subjective interpretations
- Assumption that values can be disentangled into objective assessments and subjective preferences may not hold universally across cultures
- Framework demonstrates strong performance only on domestic scenarios, leaving generalization to professional, medical, or high-stakes decision contexts untested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The technical implementation of the Value Assessment Network and PROMETHEE-based action selection module
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority claims over LLM baselines (GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4)
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the framework beyond domestic scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Inter-annotator reliability study**: Recruit 20 additional annotators to label a subset of 100 scenarios from the test set. Compute Krippendorff's alpha for each value dimension and overall ranking consistency to quantify annotation reliability.

2. **Cross-domain transfer experiment**: Adapt DMM to a professional decision-making domain (e.g., workplace ethics scenarios) by collecting 500 new scenarios and 5 user preference profiles. Compare DMM performance against LLM baselines using the same OS-Sim and First-Acc metrics.

3. **Ablation on value dimension importance**: Systematically remove each of the 6 value dimensions from the Value Assessment Network training and evaluate the impact on OS-Sim and First-Acc. This would reveal which dimensions contribute most to the framework's performance and whether certain dimensions are redundant or noisy.
