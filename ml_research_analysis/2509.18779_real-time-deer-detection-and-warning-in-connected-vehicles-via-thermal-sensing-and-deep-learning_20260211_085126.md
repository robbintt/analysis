# Real-time Deer Detection and Warning in Connected Vehicles via Thermal Sensing and Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.18779
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18779
- Reference count: 32
- The system achieved 98.84% mAP, 95.44% precision, and 95.96% recall for deer detection using thermal imaging and YOLOv8s

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive real-time deer detection and warning system for connected vehicles, addressing the critical safety issue of deer-vehicle collisions. The system integrates thermal cameras with a YOLOv8s deep learning model and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to detect deer and alert nearby vehicles and roadside units. Field testing in Mars Hill, North Carolina, demonstrated exceptional performance metrics with sub-100ms end-to-end latency and maintained high detection accuracy across diverse weather conditions, outperforming conventional visible-light cameras.

## Method Summary
The proposed system combines thermal imaging with deep learning for deer detection and V2X communication for warning dissemination. The core methodology involves collecting thermal images from the FLIR ADK camera mounted on a vehicle, preprocessing these images, and feeding them into a YOLOv8s model trained on over 12,000 thermal images. The detection results are then transmitted via V2X communication to alert nearby vehicles and roadside units. The system architecture includes thermal camera integration, YOLOv8s model implementation, V2X communication protocols, and a Raspberry Pi-based onboard processing unit. Field testing was conducted at two sites in Mars Hill, North Carolina, with data collection spanning various times of day and weather conditions.

## Key Results
- Achieved 98.84% mean average precision (mAP) and 95.44% precision in deer detection
- Maintained detection accuracy of 88-92% across diverse weather conditions
- Demonstrated sub-100ms end-to-end latency for real-time warning dissemination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from leveraging thermal imaging's ability to detect heat signatures, making deer visible regardless of lighting conditions or camouflage. The YOLOv8s model's architecture enables fast, accurate object detection with minimal computational overhead, while V2X communication allows for immediate warning dissemination to multiple vehicles and infrastructure. The combination addresses both detection and warning aspects of deer-vehicle collision prevention.

## Foundational Learning

**Thermal Imaging Fundamentals**: Understanding how thermal cameras detect infrared radiation and convert it to temperature-based images. *Why needed*: Thermal imaging is crucial for detecting deer in various lighting and weather conditions. *Quick check*: Verify that thermal cameras can detect temperature differences between deer and their surroundings.

**YOLOv8s Architecture**: Familiarization with the YOLOv8s model structure, including its convolutional neural network layers and detection head. *Why needed*: YOLOv8s provides the balance between detection accuracy and processing speed required for real-time applications. *Quick check*: Confirm that YOLOv8s can process images within the required time constraints.

**V2X Communication Protocols**: Understanding the standards and protocols for vehicle-to-everything communication, including message formats and transmission methods. *Why needed*: V2X communication is essential for warning dissemination to multiple vehicles and infrastructure. *Quick check*: Verify that V2X messages can be transmitted and received within the required latency.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Thermal Camera -> Image Preprocessing -> YOLOv8s Detection -> V2X Communication -> Warning Display

**Critical Path**: Thermal image capture → preprocessing → YOLOv8s inference → V2X message creation → transmission → warning display

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes detection accuracy over range, using a relatively low-resolution thermal camera (640x512) to achieve high accuracy but limiting detection distance. The YOLOv8s model balances speed and accuracy, while V2X communication provides broad warning dissemination at the cost of potential network congestion.

**Failure Signatures**: System failures may manifest as missed detections (false negatives), false alarms (false positives), communication delays, or complete system outages. Environmental factors like extreme weather or sensor obstructions can also cause detection failures.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test detection accuracy with varying thermal camera resolutions to quantify the range-accuracy tradeoff
2. Measure V2X communication latency and reliability under different traffic densities
3. Evaluate system performance with different deep learning model architectures (e.g., YOLOv8n, YOLOv8m) to optimize the speed-accuracy balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Detection range is limited by the thermal camera's resolution (640x512)
- System performance in extreme weather conditions (heavy fog, torrential rain) was not explicitly tested
- Field testing site may not represent diverse geographic regions and deer population densities

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Detection accuracy metrics and latency measurements are well-documented with field data
- Medium Confidence: Weather performance claims, as testing conditions were not fully specified across all weather types
- Medium Confidence: Scalability across different geographic regions and deer population densities

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extended testing across diverse geographic regions with varying deer population densities and terrain types to validate generalizability
2. Test system performance in extreme weather conditions (heavy fog, torrential rain, snow) with quantitative metrics
3. Evaluate detection range performance at highway speeds (60+ mph) to determine practical safety thresholds and limitations
