# Stochastic Optimization with Random Search

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15610

- Random search achieves O(d/ε^4) complexity under (L0,L1)-smoothness, matching gradient-based methods

## Executive Summary
This work establishes convergence rates for random search methods in stochastic optimization, extending the analysis to settings with only noisy function evaluations. The authors show that under (L0,L1)-smoothness assumptions, random search achieves O(d/ε^4) complexity, which matches gradient-based methods while avoiding discretization bias. The analysis leverages translation invariance to control difference errors rather than individual errors, providing a novel approach to stochastic optimization. The framework is extended to finite-sum cases with variance reduction and to settings with inexact human/helper feedback.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a random search method that queries function values at perturbed points and uses difference oracles to estimate gradients. The key insight is to leverage translation invariance to control difference errors rather than individual errors. For the finite-sum case, a variance-reduced variant is proposed that achieves improved complexity when the number of functions n is much larger than d/ε^2. The method also extends to settings with inexact human/helper feedback, achieving convergence up to an accuracy floor of O(√dδ) where δ bounds the feedback noise.

## Key Results
- Random search achieves O(d/ε^4) complexity under (L0,L1)-smoothness, matching gradient-based methods
- Variance-reduced variant attains O(min(d^{4/3}n^{2/3}/ε^{8/3}, dn/ε^2)) complexity in finite-sum case
- Extension to human/helper feedback settings achieves convergence up to O(√dδ) accuracy floor
- Direct adaptations of momentum techniques fail due to step-size-dependent structure of function-difference oracles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting translation invariance properties of random search to control difference errors rather than individual errors. This allows for effective gradient estimation using only function-value differences, avoiding the need for direct gradient computation. The variance reduction technique in the finite-sum case builds on this foundation by reducing the variance of the gradient estimates through careful sampling strategies.

## Foundational Learning

**Stochastic optimization**: Optimization when function values are noisy rather than exact. Needed to model real-world scenarios where exact function evaluations are expensive or impossible. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between stochastic and deterministic optimization?

**(L0,L1)-smoothness**: Extension of Lipschitz smoothness that bounds both the gradient and its variation. Needed to establish convergence guarantees for the random search method. Quick check: Can you state the (L0,L1)-smoothness conditions and explain their significance?

**Translation invariance**: Property where function differences remain unchanged under translations. Needed to control difference errors rather than individual errors. Quick check: Can you demonstrate how translation invariance simplifies the analysis of random search?

**Variance reduction**: Technique to reduce the variance of stochastic gradient estimates. Needed to improve complexity in the finite-sum case. Quick check: Can you explain how variance reduction improves convergence rates in stochastic optimization?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Random perturbation -> Function evaluation -> Difference computation -> Gradient estimate -> Parameter update

Critical path: The method requires careful control of the step-size to balance the signal-to-noise ratio in the function-difference oracle. The translation invariance property is critical for the convergence analysis.

Design tradeoffs: The O(d/ε^4) complexity bound, while matching gradient-based methods, may be pessimistic in practice where problem structure can be exploited. The extension to human/helper feedback assumes bounded feedback noise δ, but the O(√dδ) accuracy floor may be overly conservative for certain feedback mechanisms.

Failure signatures: The failure of direct momentum adaptations is shown theoretically but may warrant empirical validation across diverse problem classes. The analysis relies heavily on (L0,L1)-smoothness assumptions that may not hold in all stochastic optimization settings.

First experiments:
1. Compare random search against gradient-based methods on benchmark problems to validate the O(d/ε^4) complexity bound
2. Test the variance-reduced finite-sum algorithm on problems where n ≫ d/ε^2 to verify the theoretical improvement
3. Experiment with momentum techniques in the function-difference oracle setting to identify conditions where adaptations might succeed
