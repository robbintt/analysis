# Reinforcing User Interest Evolution in Multi-Scenario Learning for recommender systems

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17682

- Multi-scenario recommendation with user interest evolution; RUIE achieves NDCG@20 of 14.6784 on KuaiSAR dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of modeling user interest evolution across multiple recommendation scenarios, where user preferences may shift and exhibit negative transfer between scenarios. The authors propose a reinforcement learning-based approach, RUIE, that employs Double Q-learning to estimate behavior confidence (Q-values) across scenarios and integrates contrastive learning loss with Q-value gating. The method uses a contextual Q estimator combining multi-head attention and fully connected networks to capture user behavior migration and scenario-item associations. Experiments on the KuaiSAR dataset demonstrate that RUIE significantly outperforms strong baselines (DIN, Caser, GRU, SASRec, PEPNet, STAR) across NDCG@5, NDCG@10, NDCG@15, and NDCG@20 metrics, achieving the highest scores of 3.8549, 7.4901, 11.1098, and 14.6784 respectively.

## Method Summary
RUIE employs a three-module architecture for multi-scenario recommendation. First, a NextItNet backbone processes behavioral sequences using dilated convolutional layers. Second, a Scenario-aware User Intent Module uses Double Q-learning with a Contextual Q Estimator (4-head attention + FC layers) to estimate Q-values across scenarios and capture user behavior migration patterns. Third, an Intent Representation Learning module generates user representations using triplet loss with 10 negative samples. The final training loss combines Q-learning loss with a gated triplet loss, where the gate value is inversely proportional to the probability of next scenario occurrence. The model is trained on the KuaiSAR dataset with behavior-based rewards (click=1, follow=3, like=3, share=2) and evaluated using full-ranking NDCG@K metrics.

## Key Results
- RUIE achieves NDCG@20 score of 14.6784, significantly outperforming baselines (PEPNet 11.5, STAR 11.2)
- Ablation study confirms multi-head attention, gating mechanism, and reinforcement learning components each contribute substantially to performance gains
- Consistent improvements across all metrics (NDCG@5, NDCG@10, NDCG@15, NDCG@20) demonstrate robustness of the approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RUIE addresses multi-scenario recommendation by modeling user interest evolution through reinforcement learning. The Double Q-learning framework estimates scenario-specific Q-values that represent user confidence in different recommendation contexts. The gating mechanism prevents negative transfer by scaling the contrastive loss based on scenario transition probabilities. Multi-head attention captures complex interactions between user behaviors across scenarios, while the NextItNet backbone provides effective sequence modeling. The combination of these components enables RUIE to adapt to shifting user interests while maintaining scenario-specific preferences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Double Q-learning**: Why needed - prevents overestimation bias in Q-value estimation; Quick check - monitor Q-value distribution for scenario differentiation
- **Multi-head attention**: Why needed - captures complex user behavior patterns across scenarios; Quick check - verify attention weights show meaningful scenario-item associations
- **Contrastive learning**: Why needed - improves representation learning by maximizing similarity between positive pairs; Quick check - ensure triplet loss converges without gradient explosion
- **Gating mechanism**: Why needed - prevents negative transfer by scaling loss based on scenario transitions; Quick check - monitor gate values to ensure they don't cause instability

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: User behavior sequence -> NextItNet -> Contextual Q Estimator (multi-head attention + FC) -> Scenario-aware Intent Module -> Gated triplet loss -> Final representation

**Critical path**: NextItNet encoding -> Q-value estimation -> Intent representation -> Triplet loss with gating -> NDCG evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: Uses Double Q-learning instead of single Q-learning to reduce overestimation bias, at the cost of additional network parameters. Multi-head attention provides better scenario modeling but increases computational complexity. The gating mechanism adds stability but requires careful tuning of ε parameter.

**Failure signatures**: Q-value instability causing scenario collapse, gate values causing gradient explosion, poor convergence due to incorrect sequence padding. Monitor Q-value distributions, gate statistics, and input shapes during training.

**First experiments**: 1) Verify Q-value distributions show differentiation across scenarios during training. 2) Test gating mechanism stability by monitoring gate statistics. 3) Validate combined loss formulation by training with individual components.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several important unresolved issues emerge from the analysis:

### Open Question 1
How sensitive is RUIE's performance to the design of the reward function, specifically the assigned values for different user behaviors (click=1, follow=3, like=3, share=2)? The arbitrary nature of these values suggests performance may vary significantly under different reward configurations, but no sensitivity analysis was conducted.

### Open Question 2
Does RUIE maintain its performance advantages when evaluated across longer time horizons and diverse recommendation domains beyond short-video platforms? The short evaluation window (one week training, one day testing) and single-domain testing limit conclusions about long-term interest evolution and cross-domain generalizability.

### Open Question 3
How does RUIE perform in cold-start scenarios for new users or newly introduced recommendation scenarios with limited behavioral history? The paper mentions exposure bias but does not analyze performance in sparse data conditions or stratified by user activity level.

### Open Question 4
What is the computational overhead of RUIE compared to simpler baselines, and is the performance improvement justified for large-scale real-time deployment? The paper does not report training time, inference latency, or memory requirements despite adding multiple complex components.

## Limitations
- Missing critical hyperparameters (embedding dimension, temperature coefficient, NextItNet architecture details) that affect reproducibility
- Short evaluation window (one week training, one day testing) limits assessment of long-term interest evolution
- No computational overhead analysis despite complex RL and attention components

## Confidence
- Performance claims: Medium (significant gaps observed, but implementation details missing)
- Ablation study validity: High (clear component contributions demonstrated)
- Reproducibility: Low-Medium (major architectural specifications unspecified)

## Next Checks
1. Implement the Contextual Q Estimator with 4-head attention and verify Q-value distributions show scenario differentiation during training
2. Test the gating mechanism stability by monitoring Gate statistics and ensuring next_scenario_prob values remain bounded away from 1
3. Validate the combined loss formulation (Loss_q + Gate × triplet_loss) by training with individual components and measuring their contributions to NDCG@K metrics
