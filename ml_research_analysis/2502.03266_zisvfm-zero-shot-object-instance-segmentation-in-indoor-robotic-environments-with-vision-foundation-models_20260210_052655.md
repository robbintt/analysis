# ZISVFM: Zero-Shot Object Instance Segmentation in Indoor Robotic Environments with Vision Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.03266
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03266
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Zero-shot instance segmentation method achieving F-measures of 89.2%, 76.5%, and 90.5% on OCID, OSD, and HIOD datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
ZISVFM addresses the challenge of segmenting unseen objects in unstructured indoor robotic environments where traditional supervised learning methods are impractical due to object diversity. The method leverages the zero-shot capabilities of Segment Anything Model (SAM) combined with self-supervised Vision Transformer features from DINOv2 to enable robust instance segmentation without requiring training on specific object categories. By processing colorized depth images and applying attention-based feature refinement through K-Medoids clustering, ZISVFM generates precise object masks suitable for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

## Method Summary
ZISVFM operates through a three-stage pipeline that combines SAM's prompt-based segmentation with ViT attention features. First, SAM generates object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images. These proposals are then refined using attention-based features extracted from a self-supervised ViT trained with DINOv2, which filters out non-object masks. Finally, K-Medoids clustering on the refined features produces point prompts that guide SAM to generate precise instance segmentations. The method demonstrates effectiveness across multiple benchmark datasets (OCID, OSD) and a self-collected dataset (HIOD), with validation through real-world robotic manipulation experiments using a Fetch mobile robot.

## Key Results
- Achieved F-measure of 89.2% on OCID dataset
- Achieved F-measure of 76.5% on OSD dataset
- Achieved F-measure of 90.5% on self-collected HIOD dataset
- Outperformed baseline methods and achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ZISVFM leverages SAM's powerful zero-shot segmentation capabilities while addressing its limitations in object identification through the integration of ViT attention features. The colorized depth images provide geometric context that helps SAM distinguish objects from backgrounds, while the DINOv2-trained ViT captures rich visual representations that enable effective filtering of non-object proposals. The K-Medoids clustering approach efficiently groups similar features to generate targeted prompts, allowing SAM to focus on actual object instances rather than background clutter or partial objects.

## Foundational Learning

**Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: A foundation model for image segmentation that can segment any object given appropriate prompts. *Why needed*: Provides zero-shot segmentation capability without requiring object-specific training. *Quick check*: Verify SAM can segment novel objects in controlled test scenes.

**Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A transformer-based architecture that processes images as sequences of patches for self-supervised learning. *Why needed*: Extracts rich visual features from colorized depth images for object proposal refinement. *Quick check*: Confirm ViT features capture meaningful object boundaries in depth-enhanced images.

**DINOv2**: A self-supervised learning framework for training ViTs on large-scale image datasets. *Why needed*: Provides pre-trained ViT models with strong visual representation capabilities without requiring labeled data. *Quick check*: Validate DINOv2 features generalize to indoor robotic environments.

**K-Medoids Clustering**: A clustering algorithm that partitions data by finding representative objects (medoids) in feature space. *Why needed*: Groups similar object proposals to generate effective prompts for SAM. *Quick check*: Ensure clustering correctly identifies distinct object instances in cluttered scenes.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Colorized Depth Image -> SAM Mask Proposals -> ViT Feature Refinement -> K-Medoids Clustering -> SAM Point Prompts -> Instance Segmentation

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is depth image preprocessing → SAM proposal generation → ViT feature extraction → clustering → final segmentation, as each stage depends on the quality of the previous one.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency for zero-shot generalization, requiring multiple model inferences (SAM and ViT) per image. The clustering step introduces additional computation but enables more precise object identification compared to direct SAM application.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs with transparent or reflective objects, highly cluttered scenes where objects overlap in feature space, and when depth information is noisy or unavailable. SAM may also fail to generate meaningful proposals for objects with unusual shapes or textures.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test SAM alone on depth colorized images without ViT refinement to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate ViT feature quality by visualizing attention maps on object vs. non-object regions
3. Run K-Medoids clustering on synthetic feature distributions to verify cluster formation matches object boundaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance degrades on transparent, reflective, or textureless objects not well-represented in training data
- Computational efficiency not reported, making real-time application assessment difficult
- Clustering approach may fail when similar-looking objects appear in the same scene

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Strong empirical performance metrics on benchmark datasets and successful real-world robotic manipulation demonstration
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability across different indoor environments given limited systematic cross-dataset validation
- **Medium confidence**: Superiority over baseline methods due to incomplete description of baseline implementations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing each component (colorized depth, ViT features, clustering) to quantify their individual contributions
2. Test method performance on objects with challenging visual properties (transparent, reflective, textureless) common in real robotic environments
3. Measure and report end-to-end computational latency for the complete pipeline to assess real-time feasibility for robotic applications
