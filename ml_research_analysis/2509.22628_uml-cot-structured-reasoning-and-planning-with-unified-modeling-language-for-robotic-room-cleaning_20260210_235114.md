core_contribution: This paper introduces UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
  framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate interpretable
  and executable action plans for robotic room cleaning. Unlike text-based Chain-of-Thought
  (CoT) methods, UML-CoT uses class diagrams to model object semantics and activity

# UML-CoT: Structured Reasoning and Planning with Unified Modeling Language for Robotic Room Cleaning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22628
- Authors: Hongyu Chen; Guangrun Wang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves higher semantic similarity (0.569), recall (0.674), and F1 score (0.590) compared to text-based baselines on MRoom-30k benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate interpretable and executable action plans for robotic room cleaning. Unlike text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, UML-CoT uses class diagrams to model object semantics and activity diagrams to represent procedural control flows, enabling more expressive and standardized reasoning. The method is trained through a three-stage pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and reward learning from answer-only data. Evaluated on the MRoom-30k benchmark, UML-CoT demonstrates superior interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success compared to text-based baselines.

## Method Summary
UML-CoT is a structured reasoning and planning framework that replaces text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams for robotic room cleaning tasks. The method employs class diagrams to model object semantics and relationships, while activity diagrams represent procedural control flows and action sequences. The framework is trained through a three-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on annotated data, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and reward learning from answer-only data. This approach enables more expressive, interpretable, and standardized reasoning compared to traditional text-based methods, with evaluation conducted on the MRoom-30k benchmark.

## Key Results
- Achieves semantic similarity score of 0.569 on MRoom-30k benchmark
- Attains recall of 0.674 and F1 score of 0.590, outperforming text-based baselines
- Demonstrates superior interpretability and planning coherence through UML-based structured reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind UML-CoT's effectiveness lies in its use of standardized UML diagrams (class and activity diagrams) to represent both object semantics and procedural control flows. This structured representation provides a more expressive and interpretable format compared to text-based Chain-of-Thought methods, allowing for clearer modeling of object relationships and action sequences in robotic room cleaning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**: Standardized modeling language for visualizing system design - needed to provide structured, interpretable representations of reasoning processes
- **Class Diagrams**: Show classes, attributes, and relationships between objects - needed to model object semantics and environmental understanding
- **Activity Diagrams**: Represent procedural flows and control structures - needed to model action sequences and decision points in planning
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Sequential reasoning process used in language models - needed as baseline comparison for text-based reasoning approaches
- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Reinforcement learning algorithm that compares policies within groups - needed for training the planning component

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Vision Encoder -> Class Diagram Generator -> Activity Diagram Generator -> Plan Execution Module
- **Critical Path**: Input observation → Object detection/classification → Class diagram creation → Activity diagram generation → Action plan execution
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Uses structured UML diagrams instead of text for better interpretability and standardization, but requires more complex generation and parsing compared to text-based methods
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor object recognition leading to incorrect class diagrams; missing environmental context causing incomplete activity diagrams; incorrect sequence modeling resulting in invalid action plans
- **First Experiments**: 1) Generate class diagrams from synthetic room layouts to verify object modeling accuracy; 2) Test activity diagram generation on predefined procedural tasks; 3) Validate plan execution on simple cleaning scenarios with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily relies on semantic similarity metrics rather than actual execution success rates in real-world robotic deployments
- Three-stage training pipeline (SFT + GRPO + reward learning) may face scalability challenges in more diverse or unstructured environments
- Dependency on annotated datasets for reward learning introduces potential bias and may limit generalization to novel scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in architectural design and formalization of UML-CoT due to theoretically sound integration of class and activity diagrams
- Medium confidence in claimed performance improvements as evaluation metrics focus on semantic similarity rather than real-world task completion
- Low confidence in generalizability to unstructured or dynamic environments given current validation constraints to MRoom-30k benchmark

## Next Checks
1. Deploy UML-CoT on a physical robot in a real-world room cleaning scenario to measure actual task completion rates and compare against text-based CoT methods under identical conditions
2. Test the framework's robustness by introducing novel object categories or environmental layouts not present in the MRoom-30k training data to assess generalization capabilities
3. Conduct a user study with robotics engineers to evaluate whether UML-generated plans are indeed more interpretable and easier to debug compared to text-based plans, using standardized interpretability metrics
