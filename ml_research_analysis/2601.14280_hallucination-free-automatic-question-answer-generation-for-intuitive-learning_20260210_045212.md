# Hallucination-Free Automatic Question & Answer Generation for Intuitive Learning

## Quick Facts

- This paper presents a multi-agent framework that reduces AI-generated educational MCQ hallucinations by over 90% through iterative refinement and specialized detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the problem of hallucinations in AI-generated educational multiple-choice questions, which can undermine trust and learning efficiency. The authors propose a multi-agent framework that decomposes MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages, using specialized agents to detect and correct four types of hallucinations: reasoning inconsistencies, insolvability, factual errors, and mathematical errors. The system employs iterative refinement, guided by hallucination scoring metrics and chain-of-thought reasoning, to optimize question quality. Evaluated on AP-aligned STEM questions, the approach reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while maintaining educational value and style.

## Method Summary
The framework decomposes MCQ generation into a Generator-Detector iterative loop, where the Generator creates questions and the Detector evaluates and provides feedback on four hallucination types. The process continues until hallucination scores fall below thresholds or improvements plateau. The method uses specialized agents for different hallucination types, chain-of-thought reasoning, and dynamic iteration control with early stopping.

## Key Results
- Reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation
- Maintained educational value and style of generated questions
- Demonstrated cost-effectiveness using lightweight models with iterative refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Decomposing hallucination detection into four independent components enables targeted verification and repair.
- **Mechanism:** The framework formalizes hallucination as H = ω₁H₁ + ω₂H₂ + ω₃H₃ + ω₄H₄, where each Hᵢ represents a distinct error type (inconsistency, insolvability, factual error, mathematical error). Because components are independent, minimizing H reduces to minimizing each Hᵢ separately via specialized agents.
- **Core assumption:** The four hallucination types are largely independent; correcting one does not systematically introduce another.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] identifies four key hallucination types; [Page 2] states minimizing H is equivalent to minimizing each component; weak corpus support for independence assumption.
- **Break condition:** If hallucination types exhibit strong co-occurrence or causal dependencies, single-agent targeted repair may propagate errors across dimensions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** An iterative Generator-Detector loop with early stopping reduces hallucination more effectively than single-pass generation.
- **Mechanism:** The Generator produces MCQ^(t), the Detector evaluates and returns hallucination feedback H^(t+1). Iteration continues until H^(t) < ε₁ (threshold) or |H^(t) - H^(t+1)| < ε₂ (diminishing returns). The Detector's lower-entropy evaluation task makes it more reliable than the Generator's high-entropy creation task.
- **Core assumption:** Detectors hallucinate less than Generators due to lower entropy in evaluation vs. generation tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 3] states Detectors perform holistic evaluation with lower entropy; [Page 4, Figure 2-4] shows hallucination decreases ~50% after 1 iteration, ~90%+ after 7 iterations; neighbor paper supports multi-agent decomposition.
- **Break condition:** If Detector accuracy degrades on domain-specific content, false negatives may allow hallucinations to persist.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Structured verification with lightweight models can outperform single-pass generation with expensive reasoning models on hallucination metrics.
- **Mechanism:** Using GPT-4.1-nano ($0.10/1M tokens) with multi-agent refinement achieves lower hallucination than GPT-o3-mini ($1.10/1M tokens) in single-pass, by distributing verification across specialized agents and iterative correction.
- **Core assumption:** The cost of multiple lightweight-agent calls is offset by hallucination reduction gains and remains below single expensive-model call costs for practical deployment.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 4] states GPT-4.1-nano is priced at $0.10 per 1 million tokens vs. GPT-o3-mini's $1.10; [Page 4] shows solution can converge hallucination close to 0 by 7 iterations; no direct corpus comparison of cost-effectiveness.
- **Break condition:** If iteration count scales non-linearly with question complexity, cost benefits may erode for advanced or multi-step problems.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generative Adversarial Dynamics**
  - **Why needed here:** The Generator-Detector framework is explicitly inspired by GANs; understanding adversarial feedback loops clarifies why iterative refinement works.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a Detector with lower entropy might produce fewer hallucinations than a Generator?

- **Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
  - **Why needed here:** CoT is embedded in the refinement process; the framework extends CoT with external verification.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the two core limitations of CoT that the paper identifies, and how does multi-agent iteration address them?

- **Concept: Optimization via Iterative Refinement**
  - **Why needed here:** MCQ generation is reformulated as minimizing a hallucination score; understanding convergence criteria (threshold and diminishing returns) is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** What two conditions terminate the iteration loop, and why might both be necessary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Generator -> Detector₁ -> Generator (revise) -> Detector₂ -> ... -> Orchestrator (terminates)
- **Critical path:** 1. Generator produces initial MCQ 2. First Detector evaluates primary hallucination type 3. If H > threshold, feedback → Generator revises 4. Orchestrator routes to next Detector or terminates 5. Repeat until H < ε or improvement negligible
- **Design tradeoffs:** Cost vs. Quality (more iterations reduce hallucination but increase token costs); Model Selection (lightweight models require more iterations); Detector Specialization (specialized agents improve targeted repair but increase orchestration complexity)
- **Failure signatures:** Non-convergence (H oscillates without reaching threshold); False negative (Detector approves MCQ with undetected hallucination); Cost overrun (Iteration count exceeds expected range without hallucination reduction)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Baseline comparison (50 MCQs single-pass vs. 7-iteration refined output) 2. Ablation on Detector order (test routing sequence effects) 3. Model swap test (replace GPT-4.1-nano with higher-capacity model in Generator-only mode)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the framework maintain its high performance when applied to non-STEM domains where reasoning is less objective or structured?
- How can the hallucination scoring functions be scaled to minimize latency and cost while preserving the observed 90% error reduction?
- To what extent does the "Detector" agent's own potential for hallucination limit the theoretical maximum accuracy of the system?

## Limitations
- The independence assumption for hallucination types remains largely untested with minimal empirical evidence
- Cost-effectiveness claims rely on projected token pricing rather than measured deployment costs across varied question complexities
- The knowledge base K for factual verification is unspecified, raising concerns about domain coverage and update frequency

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The multi-agent iterative refinement framework can reduce hallucination rates by >90% on AP-aligned STEM questions
- **Medium confidence**: Specialized hallucination detectors are more effective than single-pass generation for educational MCQ quality
- **Low confidence**: The framework generalizes to non-STEM domains or advanced multi-step reasoning problems without significant architectural modifications

## Next Checks
1. **Co-occurrence analysis**: Analyze a large sample of generated MCQs to measure correlations between hallucination types; if H₁ and H₃ errors co-occur >30% of the time, independence assumption fails
2. **Detector fidelity test**: Use human experts to validate Detector classifications on 100 MCQs; compute precision/recall for each Hᵢ detector and measure false negative rates
3. **Cost scaling experiment**: Generate MCQs across varying complexity levels with both multi-agent and single-model approaches; track total token cost and hallucination reduction per dollar
