# Causal-EPIG: A Prediction-Oriented Active Learning Framework for CATE Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21866
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21866
- Reference count: 40
- Addresses CATE estimation under limited data resources through prediction-oriented active learning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Causal-EPIG, a novel active learning framework for estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) when data acquisition is expensive. Traditional active learning methods focus on observable outcomes, but CATE estimation requires inferring unobservable counterfactuals—a fundamental misalignment that Causal-EPIG resolves by targeting causal quantities directly. The framework derives two acquisition strategies from the Expected Predictive Information Gain principle: a comprehensive approach targeting joint potential outcomes and a focused approach targeting the CATE directly. Experiments with multiple Bayesian CATE estimators demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, validating that optimal acquisition strategies depend on the base estimator and data complexity.

## Method Summary
Causal-EPIG extends the Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) principle to estimate unobservable causal quantities rather than observable outcomes or model parameters. The framework first targets the joint potential outcomes (Y(0), Y(1)) and then derives the CATE function τ(x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X=x]. This leads to two distinct acquisition strategies: Causal-EPIG-(0,1) which comprehensively targets both potential outcomes jointly, and Causal-EPIG-τ which directly targets the CATE function. Both strategies are compatible with various Bayesian CATE estimators including Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF), Causal Multi-task Gaussian Processes (CMGP), and Neural Spline Gaussian Processes (NSGP). The framework addresses the fundamental challenge that standard active learning methods cannot directly target counterfactual outcomes, providing a principled solution for resource-constrained causal inference settings.

## Key Results
- Causal-EPIG strategies consistently outperform strong baselines across synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks
- The focused Causal-EPIG-τ strategy shows particular effectiveness when the CATE function is well-specified
- Both comprehensive and focused strategies demonstrate superior performance, validating the context-dependent nature of optimal acquisition
- Framework successfully integrates with multiple Bayesian CATE estimators (BCF, CMGP, NSGP)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by reframing active learning around the prediction of unobservable counterfactuals rather than observable outcomes. By applying EPIG to causal quantities, it directly targets the information needed for CATE estimation. The comprehensive strategy captures the full joint distribution of potential outcomes, while the focused strategy exploits the direct relationship between observations and the CATE function. This prediction-oriented approach aligns the acquisition objective with the ultimate causal inference goal, overcoming the fundamental limitation of traditional methods that cannot target counterfactuals directly.

## Foundational Learning

**Counterfactual reasoning**: Understanding unobservable potential outcomes is essential for causal inference. Quick check: Can you explain why Y(0) and Y(1) cannot both be observed for the same unit?

**Bayesian CATE estimators**: Various approaches exist for estimating CATE with uncertainty quantification. Quick check: What distinguishes BCF, CMGP, and NSGP in their treatment of heterogeneity?

**Expected Predictive Information Gain**: EPIG measures the expected reduction in predictive uncertainty from acquiring new data. Quick check: How does EPIG differ from variance reduction or entropy-based acquisition criteria?

**Active learning misalignment**: Standard methods target observable outcomes, creating a gap for causal inference. Quick check: Why can't traditional active learning directly optimize for CATE estimation?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data acquisition -> Bayesian CATE estimator -> EPIG computation -> Acquisition function -> Next unit selection

**Critical path**: The acquisition function computation is the critical path, requiring posterior sampling from the CATE estimator and EPIG evaluation for candidate units.

**Design tradeoffs**: Bayesian requirement provides uncertainty quantification but increases computational cost; comprehensive strategy is more robust but computationally heavier than focused strategy.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance when base CATE estimator is misspecified; degradation when uncertainty estimates are unreliable; computational bottlenecks in EPIG evaluation for large candidate sets.

**First experiments**: 1) Test on synthetic data with known CATE to verify improvement over random acquisition; 2) Compare comprehensive vs focused strategies across different CATE complexity levels; 3) Evaluate sensitivity to base estimator misspecification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on base estimator specification, with potential degradation when CATE function is misspecified
- Bayesian estimator requirement may limit applicability in computationally constrained or non-Bayesian settings
- Experimental focus on continuous outcomes leaves binary/categorical outcome performance unexplored
- Computational complexity of EPIG evaluation may limit scalability to very large datasets

## Confidence

**Theoretical framework**: High confidence in the extension of EPIG to unobservable causal quantities
**Experimental results**: Medium confidence due to reliance on synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks
**Generalizability of focused strategy**: Medium confidence regarding sensitivity to CATE model specification
**Real-world applicability**: Medium confidence pending validation on complex, noisy real-world datasets

## Next Checks

1. Test framework on real-world datasets with complex confounding structures and measurement error to assess robustness beyond controlled conditions
2. Evaluate performance when base CATE estimators are misspecified or when CATE function is highly nonlinear, comparing comprehensive versus focused strategies
3. Benchmark against non-Bayesian active learning approaches to determine whether Bayesian requirement is essential or if similar gains could be achieved through alternative uncertainty quantification methods
