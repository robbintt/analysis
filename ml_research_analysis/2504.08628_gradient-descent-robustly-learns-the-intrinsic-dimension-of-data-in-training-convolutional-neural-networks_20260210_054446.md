# Gradient Descent Robustly Learns the Intrinsic Dimension of Data in Training Convolutional Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.08628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08628
- Authors: Chenyang Zhang; Peifeng Gao; Difan Zou; Yuan Cao
- Reference count: 6
- This paper studies the rank of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by gradient descent, focusing on robustness to image background noises

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how convolutional neural networks trained by gradient descent learn the intrinsic dimension of data, particularly when images contain background noise. The authors demonstrate that CNN ranks are more robust to background noise compared to data ranks, and theoretically prove that CNNs can learn the intrinsic dimension of clean images despite relatively large background noises. The study provides both theoretical analysis and experimental validation showing that CNN filter ranks remain close to clean data ranks across different noise levels, while data ranks increase dramatically with noise.

## Method Summary
The paper combines theoretical analysis with experimental validation to study how gradient descent trains convolutional neural networks. The theoretical framework analyzes the rank dynamics of CNN filters during training, showing that under specific conditions, the stable rank of CNN filters approaches the rank of clean data (2K) within a polynomial number of iterations. The experimental component validates these findings using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and synthetic datasets, comparing the rank behavior of CNN filters versus data matrices under varying noise conditions. The analysis reveals that different convolutional filters are updated in distinct directions based on their random initialization, with each filter's direction determined by its initial alignment with basis vectors.

## Key Results
- CNN filter ranks remain stable and close to clean data ranks across different noise levels, while data ranks increase dramatically with noise
- Theoretical proof shows CNN filters can learn the intrinsic dimension of clean data (approaching rank 2K) within polynomial iterations, even with relatively large background noises
- Different convolutional filters are updated in distinct directions based on their random initialization, with each filter's direction determined by its initial alignment with basis vectors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind this robustness lies in how gradient descent updates different convolutional filters during training. Each filter is initialized randomly and updates in a direction determined by its initial alignment with the basis vectors of the clean data. This means that even when background noise is present, the filters collectively capture the intrinsic structure of the clean data through their coordinated updates. The theoretical analysis shows that this process converges to the clean data's intrinsic dimension (2K) within polynomial time, while the data matrix itself, which includes noise, can have a rank that explodes. The key insight is that the optimization process naturally separates the clean signal from the noise through the specific update dynamics of different filters.

## Foundational Learning

**Gradient Descent Dynamics**: Understanding how gradient descent updates parameters over iterations is crucial for analyzing the convergence behavior of CNN filters. This concept is needed to track how the stable rank of filters evolves during training. Quick check: Verify that gradient updates follow the expected direction and magnitude based on the loss gradient.

**Matrix Rank and Stable Rank**: The rank of a matrix measures its dimensionality, while stable rank provides a more robust measure for analyzing high-dimensional data. These concepts are essential for quantifying the intrinsic dimension of both data and CNN filters. Quick check: Confirm that rank calculations match expected values for simple test matrices.

**Random Initialization in Neural Networks**: The random initialization of convolutional filters determines their initial alignment with data basis vectors, which in turn influences their update directions during training. This concept explains why different filters learn different aspects of the data. Quick check: Verify that different random seeds produce different filter behaviors.

**Convolutional Neural Network Architecture**: Understanding how CNNs process input data through convolutional layers is necessary to analyze how filters capture spatial patterns. This architecture enables the decomposition of data into learned features. Quick check: Ensure that convolutional operations correctly implement the intended feature extraction.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Images -> Convolutional Layers -> Filter Updates -> Stable Rank Convergence
**Critical Path**: Data Input → CNN Forward Pass → Gradient Computation → Filter Parameter Updates → Rank Analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between filter count and filter size affects the capacity to learn intrinsic dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. Larger filters may capture more complex patterns but increase computational cost.
**Failure Signatures**: If filters fail to converge to the clean data rank, this may indicate insufficient training iterations, inappropriate learning rates, or initialization that poorly aligns with data structure.
**First Experiments**: 1) Measure filter rank convergence on clean data without noise to establish baseline behavior. 2) Test rank robustness by gradually increasing background noise levels. 3) Compare rank dynamics across different CNN architectures (varying depth and width).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical analysis assumes specific conditions on initialization and noise distributions that may not hold in practical scenarios
- The polynomial convergence rate claims rely on idealized assumptions about gradient descent dynamics
- The experimental validation focuses primarily on relatively simple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and may not generalize to more complex, real-world data distributions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical observations showing CNN filter ranks remaining stable across noise levels while data ranks increase are well-supported by experimental results across multiple datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: The theoretical proof that CNN filters can learn the intrinsic dimension of clean data under noise conditions, while mathematically rigorous, depends on idealized assumptions that may not fully capture practical scenarios.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that different convolutional filters are updated in distinct directions based on random initialization, though intuitively plausible, lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse network architectures and initialization schemes.

## Next Checks

1. Test the theoretical bounds and empirical observations on more complex, real-world datasets (e.g., ImageNet, medical imaging datasets) to assess generalizability beyond MNIST and CIFAR-10.

2. Investigate the impact of different optimization algorithms (Adam, SGD with momentum) on the intrinsic dimension learning process and compare their robustness to background noise with standard gradient descent.

3. Conduct ablation studies varying network depth, width, and architectural choices (e.g., residual connections) to understand how these factors influence the ability to learn intrinsic dimensions in noisy environments.
