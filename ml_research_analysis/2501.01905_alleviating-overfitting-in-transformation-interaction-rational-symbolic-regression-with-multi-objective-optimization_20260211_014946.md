# Alleviating Overfitting in Transformation-Interaction-Rational Symbolic Regression with Multi-Objective Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.01905
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01905
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: MOO-based TIR variants perform comparably to or slightly better than single-objective penalized approach on smaller datasets while maintaining similar performance on larger datasets

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the use of multi-objective optimization (MOO) to alleviate overfitting in symbolic regression using the Transformation-Interaction-Rational (TIR) representation. The authors extend TIR with MOO, specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize both approximation accuracy and expression simplicity simultaneously. Experimental results on the SRBench benchmark show that MOO-based variants, particularly TIRMOO-Sel-points, perform comparably to or slightly better than the single-objective penalized approach on smaller datasets while maintaining similar performance on larger datasets. The MOO approach naturally applies Occam's Razor by selecting simpler models with comparable accuracy, eliminating the need for additional hyperparameters. However, the improvement in generalization on small datasets is small and statistically insignificant, suggesting further strategies are needed.

## Method Summary
The study extends the Transformation-Interaction-Rational (TIR) symbolic regression representation with multi-objective optimization principles. The authors implement NSGA-II as the optimization algorithm, which simultaneously optimizes two objectives: approximation accuracy and expression simplicity. The approach eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters that typically control model complexity in single-objective penalized methods. The TIR representation itself encodes transformations and interactions between variables in a rational function form, allowing for complex nonlinear relationships. The MOO framework naturally selects simpler models when multiple solutions achieve similar accuracy levels, effectively implementing Occam's Razor without explicit complexity penalties.

## Key Results
- MOO-based TIR variants perform comparably to or slightly better than single-objective penalized approach on smaller datasets
- TIRMOO-Sel-points variant shows the best performance among MOO-based approaches
- Performance on larger datasets remains similar to single-objective approach
- The MOO approach eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters controlling complexity
- Improvement in generalization on small datasets is small and statistically insignificant

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MOO approach works by optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, allowing the algorithm to naturally balance accuracy and simplicity without explicit complexity penalties. By using NSGA-II to evolve a Pareto front of solutions, the method identifies models that achieve good accuracy while maintaining simplicity. This approach eliminates the need for manually tuned hyperparameters that control the trade-off between accuracy and complexity in single-objective methods. The TIR representation's ability to encode complex transformations and interactions makes it particularly suitable for this multi-objective framework, as it can capture sophisticated relationships while the MOO selection process favors simpler expressions when accuracy is comparable.

## Foundational Learning
**Symbolic Regression**: A machine learning technique that discovers mathematical expressions describing relationships in data. Why needed: It's the core problem being addressed, requiring understanding of both the mathematical and optimization aspects. Quick check: Can the method discover interpretable mathematical relationships from data?

**Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)**: Optimization technique that simultaneously optimizes multiple conflicting objectives. Why needed: It's the primary mechanism for balancing accuracy and simplicity without explicit penalties. Quick check: Does the Pareto front contain diverse solutions representing different accuracy-simplicity trade-offs?

**NSGA-II Algorithm**: A popular evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective optimization that maintains diversity and converges to the Pareto front. Why needed: It's the specific MOO algorithm used to optimize TIR expressions. Quick check: Does the algorithm effectively maintain diversity while converging to optimal solutions?

**TIR Representation**: A symbolic regression representation that encodes transformations and interactions in rational function form. Why needed: It provides the mathematical framework for expressing complex relationships. Quick check: Can the representation adequately capture the target functions in benchmark problems?

**Occam's Razor**: The principle that simpler explanations are preferable when multiple explanations fit the data equally well. Why needed: It's the underlying principle that guides model selection in the MOO framework. Quick check: Does the approach consistently select simpler models when accuracy is comparable?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> TIR Expression Generator -> NSGA-II MOO -> Pareto Front Analysis -> Selected Model

**Critical Path**: The evolutionary process from initial population through NSGA-II iterations to final Pareto front selection represents the critical path. Each generation involves fitness evaluation for both accuracy and simplicity objectives, selection based on non-domination, and genetic operations (crossover and mutation) to generate new candidate solutions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff involves balancing the exploration of complex models that may achieve high accuracy against the exploitation of simpler models that generalize better. The MOO framework handles this tradeoff by maintaining a diverse set of solutions along the Pareto front rather than committing to a single optimal point. This approach sacrifices the ability to fine-tune a single hyperparameter for complexity control in favor of exploring the full solution space.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include premature convergence to suboptimal solutions, inability to discover appropriate transformations for complex relationships, and selection of overly complex models despite the simplicity objective. These failures may manifest as poor generalization performance, failure to capture underlying patterns in data, or models that are too complex to interpret effectively.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify the MOO framework can maintain a diverse Pareto front across multiple runs on simple benchmark functions
2. Test the sensitivity of the approach to population size and number of generations
3. Compare the selected models from different regions of the Pareto front on their generalization performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that further strategies are needed to address overfitting in symbolic regression, suggesting that the MOO approach alone may be insufficient. The authors do not extensively explore alternative MOO algorithms beyond NSGA-II or compare different selection mechanisms in depth. The study also does not investigate the approach's performance on diverse real-world datasets beyond the SRBench benchmark, limiting understanding of its generalizability. Additionally, the statistical significance of performance improvements on small datasets is not thoroughly established.

## Limitations
- Improvement in generalization on small datasets is small and statistically insignificant
- Performance is comparable rather than superior to existing single-objective penalized approaches
- Limited validation on diverse real-world datasets beyond SRBench benchmark
- Does not explore alternative MOO algorithms or compare different selection mechanisms in depth

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The TIR representation can be effectively extended with MOO principles
- **Medium confidence**: MOO-based variants perform comparably to single-objective penalized approaches
- **Medium confidence**: The elimination of additional hyperparameters is a practical benefit

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing across multiple runs and datasets to verify the claimed performance improvements
2. Compare the MOO approach against other state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods beyond the single-objective penalized baseline
3. Evaluate the approach on additional real-world datasets with varying characteristics to assess robustness and generalizability
