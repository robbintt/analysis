# Learning to Optimize Capacity Planning in Semiconductor Manufacturing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.15767
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15767
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: DRL framework with HGNN achieves 1.8% improvement in throughput and cycle time on semiconductor manufacturing testbeds

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework for capacity planning in semiconductor manufacturing, addressing the challenge of optimizing resource allocation across complex production systems. The authors propose using a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) to capture the intricate relationships between machines and operations, enabling proactive decision-making for machine-level actions including dedication, uptime, and efficiency adjustments. The policy is trained using n-step Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with parallelized simulation instances to handle the vast action space. Experiments on Intel's Minifab testbed and the larger SMT2020 scenario demonstrate substantial improvements over heuristic baselines.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines a heterogeneous graph neural network architecture with reinforcement learning to optimize capacity planning decisions in semiconductor manufacturing. The HGNN captures relationships between machines and operations, encoding machine states, task information, and temporal dependencies into a compact representation. This representation feeds into a policy network trained with n-step Proximal Policy Optimization, which learns to select machine-level actions (dedication, uptime, efficiency) that maximize throughput while minimizing cycle time. The training employs parallelized simulation instances to efficiently explore the vast action space and handle the computational complexity of the optimization problem.

## Key Results
- In the largest tested scenario (SMT2020), the trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by approximately 1.8% each compared to heuristic baselines
- The approach outperforms random actions and no-action controls across all tested scenarios
- The framework demonstrates scalability from the Minifab testbed to larger manufacturing scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The heterogeneous graph neural network effectively captures the complex relationships between machines, operations, and temporal dependencies in semiconductor manufacturing. By representing the production system as a graph where nodes represent machines and edges represent operational relationships, the HGNN can learn to identify critical bottlenecks and optimal resource allocation patterns. The n-step PPO training allows the policy to learn from longer-term consequences of decisions, capturing the multi-step dependencies inherent in manufacturing processes. Parallelized simulation enables efficient exploration of the vast action space while maintaining computational tractability.

## Foundational Learning
- **Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks**: Why needed - to capture complex relationships between different types of entities (machines, operations, products) in manufacturing systems. Quick check - verify the HGNN can distinguish between machine states and operational constraints.
- **Reinforcement Learning with n-step returns**: Why needed - to account for long-term consequences of capacity planning decisions in manufacturing. Quick check - ensure the discount factor appropriately balances immediate and future rewards.
- **Parallelized Simulation**: Why needed - to efficiently explore the vast action space while maintaining computational feasibility. Quick check - confirm that parallel instances maintain synchronized state updates.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment Simulation -> HGNN Encoder -> Policy Network -> Action Selection -> Environment Update

**Critical Path**: The policy network depends on the HGNN encoder to provide state representations, which in turn requires accurate simulation data. Training throughput is limited by simulation speed and parallel instance management.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The HGNN architecture balances expressiveness against computational complexity. Using n-step PPO versus standard PPO trades off bias in value estimation against reduced variance and better credit assignment.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate insufficient training data, inadequate simulation fidelity, or graph representation that fails to capture critical manufacturing dynamics. The framework may struggle with unexpected events not present in training data.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Validate HGNN representation learning by testing performance with different graph structures
2. Compare n-step PPO against standard PPO to quantify benefits of longer temporal horizons
3. Test scalability by incrementally increasing the number of machines and operations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability from simulated environments to real-world manufacturing systems remains uncertain
- Modest 1.8% improvement may not justify implementation complexity in all scenarios
- Framework assumes operational constraints and process dynamics can be adequately captured in simulation

## Confidence
- Technical implementation of HGNN-based DRL framework: **High**
- Performance claims within tested simulation environments: **High**
- Real-world applicability: **Medium**
- Scalability to full production facilities: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the heterogeneous graph neural network architecture versus other DRL components
2. Implement the trained policy on a pilot production line with limited complexity to assess real-world performance degradation
3. Test the framework's robustness to unexpected events such as machine failures, supply chain disruptions, and demand fluctuations
