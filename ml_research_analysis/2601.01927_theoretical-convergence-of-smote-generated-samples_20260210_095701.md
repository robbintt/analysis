# Theoretical Convergence of SMOTE-Generated Samples

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01927
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01927
- Reference count: 28
- Proves SMOTE synthetic samples converge to original distribution as sample size increases

## Executive Summary
This paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis of SMOTE's convergence properties for handling imbalanced data. The authors prove that synthetic random variables generated by SMOTE converge in probability to the original data distribution as sample size increases, and establish convergence in mean when the original variable has compact support. The analysis reveals that lower values of the nearest neighbor rank k lead to faster convergence. These theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments using real-life and synthetic data, including UCI Air Quality and California Housing datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors employ mathematical analysis to examine SMOTE's behavior under different conditions. They prove convergence in probability and mean for synthetic samples generated by SMOTE, analyzing how the choice of k-nearest neighbors affects convergence rates. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The analysis considers univariate distributions initially, with implications for multivariate settings.

## Key Results
- SMOTE-generated synthetic random variables converge in probability to the original data distribution as sample size increases
- Convergence in mean is established when the original variable has compact support
- Lower values of the nearest neighbor rank k lead to faster convergence, with k=1 being optimal

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The convergence occurs because SMOTE generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class instances and their nearest neighbors. As the number of generated samples increases, the synthetic distribution increasingly approximates the underlying minority class distribution. The interpolation mechanism ensures that synthetic points remain within the convex hull of the original data, preserving the fundamental characteristics of the minority class distribution.

## Foundational Learning
- Convergence in probability: A sequence of random variables converges in probability to a target distribution when the probability of deviation from the target decreases with sample size
  - Why needed: Forms the theoretical basis for understanding SMOTE's behavior
  - Quick check: Verify that probability of synthetic samples deviating from original distribution approaches zero as sample size increases

- Compact support distributions: Distributions where the random variable takes values within a bounded interval
  - Why needed: Enables stronger convergence guarantees (convergence in mean)
  - Quick check: Ensure original minority class data has bounded range for mean convergence

- K-nearest neighbors selection: The choice of k neighbors in SMOTE affects interpolation behavior
  - Why needed: Determines the rate and quality of convergence
  - Quick check: Experiment with different k values to observe convergence behavior

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Original data -> K-nearest neighbor search -> Interpolation -> Synthetic samples -> Generated distribution
- Critical path: Data preparation → K-NN selection → Interpolation computation → Sample generation → Distribution comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Larger k provides more diversity but slower convergence; smaller k converges faster but may overfit
- Failure signatures: Poor convergence indicates inappropriate k selection or insufficient original minority samples
- First experiments:
  1. Test convergence rates with k=1, k=3, k=5 on synthetic Gaussian data
  2. Compare convergence on compact vs non-compact support distributions
  3. Evaluate practical impact on downstream classifier performance with different k values

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis primarily focuses on univariate distributions, while SMOTE typically operates on multivariate feature spaces
- Convergence results assume well-behaved underlying distributions, but real-world imbalanced datasets often exhibit complex structures
- Extension to higher dimensions and examination of how dimensionality affects convergence rates remains an open question

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical proofs regarding univariate convergence in probability and mean for compact support distributions
- Medium confidence in numerical experiments supporting theoretical findings with limited real-world datasets
- Medium confidence in claim that k=1 yields fastest convergence, though practical significance requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. Extend theoretical analysis to multivariate settings and examine how dimensionality affects convergence rates
2. Conduct extensive experiments across diverse imbalanced datasets with varying degrees of complexity, multimodality, and noise
3. Evaluate the practical impact of convergence rates on downstream ML model performance through controlled experiments comparing different k values in realistic imbalanced classification scenarios
