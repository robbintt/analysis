# Practical Design and Benchmarking of Generative AI Applications for Surgical Billing and Coding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.05479
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05479
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Fine-tuned Phi-3 Medium model achieves 72% precision/recall for ICD-10 and 79% precision/77% recall for CPT codes, with minimal hallucinations, outperforming GPT-4o

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks generative AI for surgical billing and coding across four model configurations: base Phi-3 Mini, Phi-3 Mini with RAG, Phi-3 Mini fine-tuned, and Phi-3 Medium fine-tuned. The models were evaluated against GPT-4o using exact code matching, validity, and format consistency metrics. Results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning on modest infrastructure yields performance on par with or exceeding large state-of-the-art models, offering a practical, resource-efficient solution for medical billing automation. The fine-tuned Phi-3 Medium model achieved the highest accuracy while producing the fewest hallucinations.

## Method Summary
The research evaluated four generative AI model configurations using a dataset of 500 surgical cases with human-annotated billing codes. Models were assessed on ICD-10, CPT, and modifier code generation using exact matching, validity, and format consistency metrics. The Phi-3 Mini base model was compared against versions enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning. A larger Phi-3 Medium model was also fine-tuned and benchmarked against GPT-4o. Performance was measured across precision, recall, and hallucination rates to determine the most effective configuration for surgical billing automation.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Phi-3 Medium model achieved 72% precision and 72% recall for ICD-10 codes
- Model produced 79% precision and 77% recall for CPT codes with only 0.6% hallucination rate
- Outperformed GPT-4o while requiring significantly less computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning of smaller language models can achieve performance comparable to larger models when trained on task-relevant data. By optimizing Phi-3 models specifically for surgical billing terminology and code structures, the models developed specialized pattern recognition capabilities for medical coding syntax and relationships. The reduced parameter count of Phi-3 models, combined with targeted fine-tuning, allowed for efficient training on modest infrastructure while maintaining high accuracy. The fine-tuning process enabled the models to learn the specific mapping between surgical procedures and billing codes, reducing hallucinations that commonly occur in general-purpose models when dealing with specialized medical terminology.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain-specific fine-tuning:** Training models on specialized medical billing data improves accuracy for task-specific outputs by learning domain terminology and code relationships
- **Model size optimization:** Smaller models like Phi-3 can achieve comparable performance to larger models when properly fine-tuned for specific tasks
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Adding external knowledge retrieval can improve base model performance but may not match fine-tuned results
- **Hallucination reduction:** Fine-tuning on domain-specific data reduces false code generation by improving model confidence in valid outputs
- **Code validation metrics:** Using multiple evaluation metrics (exact matching, validity, format consistency) provides comprehensive assessment of model performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Surgical case notes -> Preprocessor -> Fine-tuned Phi-3 Medium -> Code validator -> ICD-10/CPT/Modifier outputs

**Critical path:** Input processing → Model inference → Code validation → Output formatting

**Design tradeoffs:** Smaller models require less compute but need extensive fine-tuning; larger models offer better base performance but at higher resource cost

**Failure signatures:** Code hallucinations (0.6% for CPT), format inconsistencies, inability to handle rare procedures

**3 first experiments:** 1) Test model on unseen surgical specialties, 2) Evaluate integration with existing billing software, 3) Measure performance across different healthcare systems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond specific surgical dataset and coding domains
- Evaluation metrics may not capture all clinically relevant aspects of billing accuracy
- Single-source training data may introduce selection bias
- Does not address regulatory compliance or integration with existing billing systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in benchmark results and comparative performance metrics between model configurations
- **Medium confidence** in claims about resource efficiency and practical deployment potential
- **Low confidence** in generalizability across different medical specialties or healthcare systems

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on an independent dataset from different surgical specialties or healthcare systems to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate real-world integration with existing medical billing software and compliance with healthcare regulations
3. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing the fine-tuned Phi-3 models against other commercial medical coding solutions in actual clinical workflows
