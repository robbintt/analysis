- Introduces decentralized causal discovery framework using judo calculus that generalizes do-calculus for regime-dependent causal inference

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel decentralized framework for causal discovery called "judo calculus" that generalizes classical do-calculus by allowing causal claims to be proven true locally on a cover of regimes rather than universally. The framework models context dependence using sheaves and Lawvere-Tierney modal operators, enabling more flexible and realistic causal inference in real-world applications where effects depend on regimes like age, country, or genotype. The paper introduces j-stable variants of popular causal discovery algorithms (GES, ψ-FCI, DCDI) and demonstrates their efficiency through parallel computation and improved accuracy.

## Method Summary
The judo calculus framework generalizes do-calculus by introducing context-dependent causal claims that are proven locally within regimes rather than universally. Using sheaf theory, the framework models regime heterogeneity through a cover of regimes, where each regime has its own causal model. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator defines when causal claims are valid across regimes. The paper presents j-stable versions of causal discovery algorithms including j-GES for structure learning, j-ψ-FCI for causal discovery under selection bias, and j-DCDI for nonparametric discovery. These algorithms operate by computing within each regime independently and then combining results through sheaf-theoretic operations, enabling intrinsic parallelism and better handling of regime heterogeneity.

## Key Results
- Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets (PISA, Sachs protein signaling, LINCS L1000) show j-stable methods achieve higher F1 scores and lower structural Hamming distance compared to classical pooled approaches
- The decentralized nature enables significant computational advantages through intrinsic parallelism across regimes
- j-stable algorithms demonstrate improved accuracy in capturing regime-dependent causal relationships compared to traditional methods that assume universal causal effects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that causal relationships often depend on contextual regimes rather than being universal across all populations. By allowing causal claims to be locally valid within regimes and using sheaf theory to manage the relationships between regimes, the framework can capture heterogeneity that traditional pooled approaches miss. The Lawvere-Tierney operators provide a formal mechanism for determining when local causal claims can be combined or must remain distinct across regimes. This decentralized approach enables parallel computation and more accurate modeling of real-world causal structures that exhibit regime dependence.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Sheaf Theory**: Used to model regime-dependent causal structures and their relationships. Needed because traditional causal frameworks assume universal effects, while real-world causality often depends on context. Quick check: Verify that the sheaf operations correctly capture regime overlaps and dependencies.

2. **Lawvere-Tierney Modal Operators**: Provide a formal logic for determining when causal claims are valid across regimes. Needed to define the conditions under which local causal inferences can be combined or must remain separate. Quick check: Test the operator on simple regime combinations to ensure correct propagation of causal claims.

3. **Do-Calculus Generalization**: Judo calculus extends classical do-calculus to handle regime-dependent interventions. Needed because traditional do-calculus assumes universal causal effects, limiting its applicability to heterogeneous real-world scenarios. Quick check: Verify that judo calculus reduces to standard do-calculus when regimes are identical.

4. **Cover of Regimes**: Mathematical framework for partitioning data into regimes where causal effects may differ. Needed to capture heterogeneity in causal relationships across different contexts or populations. Quick check: Validate that the cover adequately represents the true heterogeneity in test datasets.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Judo Calculus Framework -> j-GES (Structure Learning) -> j-ψ-FCI (Causal Discovery with Selection Bias) -> j-DCDI (Nonparametric Discovery) -> Sheaf-Theoretic Combination -> Final Causal Graph

Critical Path:
1. Define regime cover and data partitioning
2. Apply j-stable causal discovery algorithm within each regime
3. Use Lawvere-Tierney operators to combine local causal claims
4. Generate final decentralized causal model

Design Tradeoffs:
- **Accuracy vs. Complexity**: More granular regime partitions improve accuracy but increase computational complexity
- **Parallelization vs. Coordination**: Decentralized approach enables parallelism but requires careful management of regime boundaries and overlaps
- **Flexibility vs. Interpretability**: More flexible regime-dependent models may be harder to interpret than universal models

Failure Signatures:
- Poor regime definition leading to spurious causal claims
- Overlapping regimes causing contradictory inferences
- Computational bottlenecks when regime overlaps are substantial
- Reduced performance when true causal effects are actually universal across regimes

3 First Experiments:
1. Test j-stable algorithms on synthetic data with known regime-dependent causal structures
2. Compare j-stable vs. pooled approaches on real-world datasets with clear regime heterogeneity (e.g., age groups)
3. Measure computational speedup from parallelization across different numbers of regimes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization to high-dimensional causal structures with thousands of variables needs verification
- Computational overhead of maintaining sheaf structures may offset parallelization benefits in cases of substantial regime overlap
- Quality of causal discovery highly dependent on regime definition and coverage accuracy
- No methodology provided for automatically determining optimal regime partitions

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- Theoretical soundness of judo calculus as generalization of do-calculus
- Formal properties of sheaf-theoretic framework

Medium Confidence:
- Experimental results showing improved accuracy on tested datasets
- Claims about computational efficiency and parallelization benefits
- Framework's ability to handle regime heterogeneity

## Next Checks

1. Conduct scalability experiments on high-dimensional causal graphs (1000+ variables) to verify computational advantages hold at larger scales

2. Perform sensitivity analysis on regime definition and coverage to quantify impact of misspecification on discovery accuracy

3. Implement and test framework on temporal causal discovery problems to evaluate performance on dynamic systems with regime transitions
