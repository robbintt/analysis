# AnyPos: Automated Task-Agnostic Actions for Bimanual Manipulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12768
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12768
- Reference count: 40
- AnyPos achieves 51% higher action prediction accuracy and 30-40% higher success rates in real-world manipulation tasks compared to baselines.

## Executive Summary
AnyPos addresses the challenge of scalable robotic manipulation by learning high-precision inverse dynamics models from task-agnostic data. The framework introduces ATARA, an automated data collection pipeline that accelerates data acquisition by over 30x compared to human teleoperation. AnyPos integrates Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder (DAD) to handle the complexity of dual-arm manipulation and improve action prediction accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that AnyPos achieves 51% higher action prediction accuracy and 30-40% higher success rates in real-world manipulation tasks compared to baselines. The approach also shows promise in combining with video generation models for zero-shot task execution, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for robotic control.

## Method Summary
AnyPos learns inverse dynamics models (IDM) for bimanual manipulation from task-agnostic random action data, mapping RGB images to 14-dimensional joint actions (6-DOF per arm + 2 grippers) without task-specific supervision. The method uses ATARA for automated data collection, gathering 610k image-action pairs through reinforcement learning-based workspace coverage. The AnyPos architecture employs DINOv2-Reg encoder with Direction-Aware Decoder (DAD) and Arm-Decoupled Estimation via flood-fill segmentation. Training uses weighted smooth L1 loss with AdamW optimizer over 96k iterations, achieving 57.13% accuracy on held-out test pairs and 92.59% replay success in real-world tasks.

## Key Results
- 51% higher action prediction accuracy compared to baselines
- 30-40% higher success rates in real-world manipulation tasks
- 30x acceleration in data collection compared to human teleoperation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: RL-Based Workspace Coverage (ATARA)
Automated, task-agnostic data collection provides sufficient state-action coverage to learn a generalizable inverse dynamics model, provided the exploration policy enforces uniform sampling of the reachable volume. ATARA replaces random motor babbling with a reinforcement learning policy (PPO) trained to map target end-effector positions (sampled uniformly in a cubic volume) to valid joint configurations. This creates a dataset of physically grounded trajectories without human supervision. The inverse dynamics model can generalize to task-specific distributions if the training data covers the geometric extents of the workspace; data quality is defined by coverage density rather than task success.

### Mechanism 2: Visual Hypothesis Space Reduction via Arm-Decoupling
Decomposing the bimanual estimation problem into single-arm sub-problems mitigates cross-arm feature interference, improving convergence and accuracy. A pre-processing stage segments the input image into left/right regions using flood-fill algorithms initialized at stable pedestal joints. Independent sub-networks then predict joint positions for the respective arms. The visual features of one arm are largely irrelevant (or detrimental) to the joint state estimation of the other arm, and a clean spatial separation is possible.

### Mechanism 3: Direction-Aware Feature Refinement (DAD)
Standard visual features (e.g., DINOv2) lack the spatial precision required for sub-0.06 error joint regression; explicit orientation and geometric priors are necessary. The Direction-Aware Decoder (DAD) applies multi-scale dilated convolutions and deformable convolutions to capture geometric articulation. Crucially, it uses Angle-Sensitive Pooling (rotating features across orientations θ) to make the network robust to rotational variance in joint poses. Joint angles correlate strongly with specific directional gradients in the visual feature map, and standard pooling destroys this directional information.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM)**
  - **Why needed here:** AnyPos is fundamentally an IDM, learning p(a_i | x_i) (action given state) rather than a forward policy. This allows it to act as a "universal adapter" for video generation models, translating visual goals into motor commands without task-specific training.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why an IDM can be trained on random, task-agnostic data while a forward policy typically cannot?

- **Concept: Visual Attention & Entanglement**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper identifies "cross-arm entanglement" as a failure mode where the vision model attends to the wrong arm. Understanding spatial attention is key to diagnosing why the Arm-Decoupled Estimation is necessary.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the presence of a second arm in the frame act as a distractor for a standard CNN/Transformer trained to predict the first arm's joint angles?

- **Concept: Precision Thresholding in Regression**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper defines a strict "0.06" accuracy threshold for successful replay. Standard regression metrics (like MSE) often fail to capture the binary nature of "success" in control tasks.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a low average L1 error not guarantee high success rates in robotic manipulation tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (3 RGB Images) -> Segmentation (Flood-fill/Split-line) -> 4 Cropped Views (Left/Right Arm + Left/Right Wrist) -> Encoder (DINOv2-Reg) -> Decoder (DAD: Multi-scale Dilated -> Deformable Conv -> Angle-Sensitive Pooling) -> Head (MLP Regressor) -> 14-dim Joint Vector

- **Critical path:** The Segmentation Module is the critical dependency. If this heuristic fails (e.g., arms overlap completely), the subsequent high-precision decoders receive garbage input (wrong arm in view), leading to confident but incorrect predictions.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Heuristics vs. Learning:** Using flood-fill/split-lines for segmentation is faster and requires less data than learning a segmentation mask, but it is brittle to novel arm configurations or crossing.
  - **Modularity:** Decoupling the video model (high-level planner) from AnyPos (low-level control) allows swapping video models, but introduces a potential error propagation loop if the video frames are physically impossible.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Cross-Arm Interference:** The robot attempts to mimic the motion of the *other* arm (e.g., Left Arm moves when it should be idle because Right Arm is moving).
  - **Workspace Drift:** The arm reaches the correct position but with incorrect orientation (gripper rotation off), indicating DAD failed to capture directional features.
  - **Freeze/Jitter:** Rapid oscillation or freezing if the prediction hovers around the 0.06 error boundary.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Overfit Sanity Check:** Train AnyPos on a single ATARA trajectory. Verify it can achieve near-zero loss to confirm the architecture capacity.
  2. **Ablation on Segmentation:** Run inference on images where arms are artificially crossed/overlapped. Compare accuracy of the Arm-Decoupled version against a monolithic baseline to quantify the robustness of the segmentation heuristic.
  3. **Video Replay:** Feed the model a recorded video of a human performing a task (as done in Sec 4.3). Plot the L1 error per frame against the 0.06 threshold to visualize "safe" vs. "failure" zones.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the Arm-Decoupled Estimation strategy maintain robustness in visually complex environments where color-based segmentation heuristics fail?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 3.3.1 relies on flood-fill on "uniformly black" arms, while Section 5 explicitly lists "improve background generalization" as a limitation.
  - **Why unresolved:** The current segmentation algorithm depends on color uniformity, making it brittle against occlusion, lighting changes, or camouflaged backgrounds.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark results on datasets with heavy background clutter or varying lighting conditions where color-based segmentation fails.

- **Open Question 2:** How does the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline scale to dynamic manipulation tasks requiring high-frequency feedback or non-quasi-static motions?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 5 states the goal to "expand the action space to support... dynamic manipulation."
  - **Why unresolved:** The current evaluation focuses on tasks like "lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking," which often rely on quasi-static physics.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Success rate benchmarks on high-speed tasks such as throwing, catching, or dynamic striking.

- **Open Question 3:** To what extent does the fidelity of the upstream video generation model limit the success rate of the inverse dynamics model during zero-shot execution?
  - **Basis in paper:** Section 4.4 notes that generated videos are "non-real and slightly blurred," but the specific degradation in manipulation performance caused by video artifacts is not quantified.
  - **Why unresolved:** The modular decoupling assumes the IDM can handle generated inputs, but the error propagation from video hallucinations to action failure is unexplored.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies correlating video generation metrics (e.g., PSNR, temporal consistency) with manipulation success rates.

## Limitations

- The arm-decoupling approach may fail when arms cross or heavily occlude each other, breaking the color-based segmentation heuristic.
- ATARA's automated data collection may not generalize to highly dynamic tasks requiring precise timing or velocity profiles not present in the static exploration data.
- The Direction-Aware Decoder's reliance on directional gradients assumes consistent visual quality and resolution across deployment environments.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The experimental results showing 51% higher action prediction accuracy and 30-40% higher success rates are well-supported by the presented ablation studies and comparisons to baselines.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim of combining with video generation models for zero-shot task execution is promising but only demonstrated in preliminary form.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific architectural choices in the Direction-Aware Decoder (angle-sensitive pooling parameters, deformable convolution configuration) lack sufficient justification or ablation studies to confirm their optimality.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Arm Occlusion Test:** Systematically evaluate AnyPos's performance when arms cross or heavily occlude each other, comparing the current segmentation heuristic against a learned segmentation baseline to quantify the brittleness of the flood-fill approach.

2. **Dynamic Task Transfer:** Test whether ATARA-collected data generalizes to tasks requiring dynamic motions (high velocity/acceleration) not present in the static exploration data, measuring performance degradation compared to task-specific data collection.

3. **Video Model Integration Pipeline:** Implement and validate the full pipeline of combining AnyPos with a video generation model (e.g., OmniGenesis), measuring end-to-end task success rates and identifying where error propagation occurs between the video planner and low-level controller.
