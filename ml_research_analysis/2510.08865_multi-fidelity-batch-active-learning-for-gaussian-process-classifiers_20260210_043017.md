# Multi-fidelity Batch Active Learning for Gaussian Process Classifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08865
- Reference count: 39
- This paper introduces BPMI, a multi-fidelity acquisition function for binary classification that outperforms baseline methods on synthetic and real-world problems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficient simulation budget allocation in multi-fidelity settings for binary classification using Gaussian Process models. The authors propose Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI) as a new acquisition function that approximates mutual information between Bernoulli parameters by linearizing the probit link function. This approach specifically targets uncertain regions near decision boundaries and adaptively determines sampling frequency based on estimated aleatoric uncertainty. The method is evaluated on synthetic test cases and a real-world laser-ignited rocket combustor application, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The paper presents BPMI as a novel acquisition function for multi-fidelity active learning with Gaussian Process classifiers. BPMI approximates mutual information between Bernoulli parameters by linearizing the probit link function, addressing saturation issues in latent function MI approaches. The method focuses on uncertain regions near decision boundaries and adaptively determines sampling frequency based on estimated aleatoric uncertainty. The approach is designed to work within a batch active learning framework, allowing multiple simulations to be selected in parallel. BPMI is evaluated against baseline methods including random sampling, maximum uncertainty selection, and latent function MI approaches.

## Key Results
- BPMI consistently achieves higher Expected Log Predictive Probability (ELPP) than baseline methods across all test cases
- On the rocket combustor problem, BPMI achieved ELPP of -0.20 versus -0.22 for random sampling after three active learning iterations
- BPMI demonstrated lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to baseline methods in synthetic test cases
- The method achieved computational savings of 8,192 GPU hours in the rocket combustor application

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BPMI works by approximating mutual information between Bernoulli parameters through linearization of the probit link function. This approach avoids saturation issues that occur in latent function MI methods by focusing directly on the uncertainty in classification decisions rather than the underlying latent function values. By targeting regions near decision boundaries where classification uncertainty is highest, BPMI selects simulations that provide the most information gain for improving classification accuracy. The adaptive frequency determination based on aleatoric uncertainty estimation allows the method to allocate computational resources more efficiently across different fidelity levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: BPMI acquisition function -> Batch selection algorithm -> Multi-fidelity simulator -> GP posterior update

Critical path: BPMI calculation -> Candidate batch evaluation -> Simulation execution -> Posterior update -> Repeat

Design tradeoffs: BPMI prioritizes classification boundary uncertainty over latent function uncertainty, trading off some information-theoretic rigor for practical performance gains. The linearization approximation enables efficient computation but may introduce errors in highly non-linear regimes.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as suboptimal batch selections in regions where the probit link linearization assumption breaks down, or when aleatoric uncertainty estimation is inaccurate.

First experiments:
1. Implement BPMI acquisition function and verify it selects samples near classification boundaries
2. Compare BPMI against random sampling on a simple 2D synthetic classification problem
3. Test BPMI's adaptive frequency selection by varying input noise levels and observing sampling patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

The BPMI approach relies on linearizing the probit link function, which may introduce approximation errors when the true posterior deviates significantly from Gaussian assumptions. Performance benefits are demonstrated primarily on synthetic test cases and a single real-world application, limiting generalizability claims. The adaptive frequency determination based on aleatoric uncertainty estimation may be sensitive to the accuracy of uncertainty quantification in the GP model.

## Confidence

High: The mathematical derivation of BPMI is sound and the improvement over random sampling is consistently observed across test cases.
Medium: The comparison is limited to specific baseline methods, and sensitivity to hyperparameters like linearization point selection is not thoroughly explored.
Medium: The computational cost savings claim of 8,192 GPU hours is based on a specific problem setup and may not generalize.

## Next Checks

1. Test BPMI on additional real-world multi-fidelity classification problems with different characteristics (e.g., imbalanced classes, varying noise levels)
2. Compare BPMI against more recent multi-fidelity active learning approaches like Batch Multi-fidelity Active Learning (BMAL) on identical test cases
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the impact of the linearization approximation and adaptive frequency determination on final performance
