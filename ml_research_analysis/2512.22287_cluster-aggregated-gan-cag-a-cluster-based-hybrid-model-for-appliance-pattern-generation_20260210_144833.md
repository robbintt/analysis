# Cluster Aggregated GAN (CAG): A Cluster-Based Hybrid Model for Appliance Pattern Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.22287
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22287
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves mean error of 8.03, standard deviation error of 13.46, and fidelity RMSE of 42.6 on UVIC smart plug dataset for synthetic appliance load generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Cluster Aggregated GAN (CAG) framework to address the challenge of generating realistic synthetic appliance load data for non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). The key insight is that different appliances exhibit distinct behavioral patterns—intermittent devices show sporadic activation while continuous devices maintain steady consumption—which cannot be effectively captured by a single generative model. CAG routes each appliance trace to a specialized branch based on its behavior: intermittent devices are clustered into operational patterns and modeled by dedicated convolutional GANs, while continuous devices are modeled by LSTM-based GANs with sequence compression. A shared discriminator enforces consistent realism across both branches. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that CAG outperforms baseline methods, achieving mean error of 8.03, standard deviation error of 13.46, fidelity RMSE of 42.6, period MAE of 23.1, Feature FID of 5.82×10^16, diversity RMSE of 1.34×10^2, cluster coverage of 3.03×10^-1, and cluster JS of 6.57×10^-1.

## Method Summary
CAG employs a hybrid architecture that routes appliance load data to specialized generative models based on behavioral characteristics. The framework uses a lightweight classifier to distinguish intermittent devices (high volatility, sporadic activation) from continuous devices (low volatility, steady consumption). Intermittent devices undergo segmentation, normalization, and feature extraction followed by K-means clustering, with each cluster receiving a dedicated convolutional GAN. Continuous devices are downsampled to reduce sequence length before being processed by an LSTM-based GAN. A shared discriminator evaluates generated samples from both branches. The system is trained using Adam optimizer with learning rate 2×10^-4, batch size 32, and 1500 epochs.

## Key Results
- Achieves mean error of 8.03 and standard deviation error of 13.46 on UVIC dataset
- Outperforms baseline methods with fidelity RMSE of 42.6 and period MAE of 23.1
- Demonstrates superior pattern coverage with cluster coverage of 3.03×10^-1 and cluster JS of 6.57×10^-1
- Ablation study shows clustering is essential, with cluster coverage collapsing from 4.94×10^-1 to 1.67×10^-1 when removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Decomposing Multimodal Behavior to Prevent Mode Collapse
- **Claim:** Decomposing multimodal appliance behavior into distinct clusters mitigates mode collapse and improves pattern coverage.
- **Mechanism:** Instead of forcing a single generator to learn a complex mixture of operational states, the framework applies K-Means clustering to group segments by shape features. A dedicated lightweight GAN is trained independently on each cluster, isolating gradient updates and preventing conflicting signals from the discriminator regarding distinct operational modes.
- **Core assumption:** The optimal number of clusters (K) correlates with the intrinsic diversity of the device's usage patterns and can be captured by silhouette scores.
- **Evidence anchors:** Ablation study shows cluster coverage collapses from 4.94×10^-1 to 1.67×10^-1 when clustering is removed; related work identifies diversity limitations in existing methods.
- **Break condition:** If appliance behavior exists as a smooth continuum rather than distinct clusters, hard clustering may introduce artifacts in the latent space between modes.

### Mechanism 2: Architecture Alignment with Temporal Structure
- **Claim:** Aligning generative architectures with the intrinsic temporal structure of the load type enhances reconstruction fidelity.
- **Mechanism:** The framework routes data based on volatility and occupancy. Intermittent devices (high volatility, sharp transients) are routed to CNN-based generators which excel at local feature extraction. Continuous devices (low volatility, long dependencies) are routed to LSTM-based generators which capture sequential evolution.
- **Core assumption:** The heuristic classifier accurately separates devices into binary categories that strictly benefit from their assigned architectures.
- **Evidence anchors:** Routing logic captures intuition that continuous devices maintain high occupancy with low temporal variability; related work notes complex variability in industrial energy patterns.
- **Break condition:** If an appliance exhibits hybrid behavior, a single architecture assignment may filter out critical features of the secondary mode.

### Mechanism 3: Sequence Compression for Training Stability
- **Claim:** Sequence compression via uniform averaging stabilizes LSTM-GAN training for long-duration continuous loads.
- **Mechanism:** Raw continuous traces are downsampled by factor F before being fed to the LSTM-GAN, reducing sequence length and mitigating gradient problems. After generation, block replication restores original resolution.
- **Core assumption:** Low-frequency components preserved during downsampling are sufficient to capture the semantic truth of the continuous load profile.
- **Evidence anchors:** Downsampling reduces sequence length while preserving low frequency components and smoothing the optimization landscape.
- **Break condition:** If the continuous device contains critical high-frequency variations required for downstream tasks, the compression-reconstruction pipeline will irreversibly smooth these details.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **GAN Mode Collapse**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's primary motivation is that standard GANs fail to generate the full diversity of appliance patterns (specifically rare modes).
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a discriminator might "ignore" a rare pattern, causing the generator to fail to learn it?

- **Concept:** **Inductive Biases (CNN vs. LSTM)**
  - **Why needed here:** The CAG framework relies on the premise that CNNs are better for shape/transients and LSTMs for sequence/long-term trends.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a CNN struggle to model a 24-hour steady-state load compared to an LSTM?

- **Concept:** **Silhouette Score (Clustering Validation)**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework automates the selection of the number of generators (K) using this metric to balance cohesion and separation.
  - **Quick check question:** If the silhouette score is universally low (< 0.3) for all K, what does that imply about the appliance's operational modes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Router (Eq. 2) -> Intermittent Branch (Segmenter -> K-Means -> Pool of K CNN-GANs) OR Continuous Branch (Downsampler (Factor F) -> LSTM-GAN -> Upsampler) -> Shared Discriminator

- **Critical path:** The Feature Extraction and Clustering logic. If the features do not effectively separate usage modes, the dedicated generators will receive noisy, overlapping data, negating the anti-collapse benefits.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Resolution vs. Stability: High downsampling factor F stabilizes the LSTM but blurs output fidelity.
  - Granularity vs. Compute: Increasing K improves pattern coverage but linearly increases training time and memory.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Spike Smoothing: Generated continuous data looks like a "staircase" (block replication artifacts) → Reduce downsampling factor F.
  - Cluster Collapse: Intermittent generator ignores rare modes → Check silhouette scores; clusters may be poorly formed or imbalanced.
  - Routing Error: Smooth appliance sent to CNN branch → Check thresholds ρ and τ in the Router.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Router Validation:** Run the Router on the UVIC test set. Verify that the "Intermittent" list (Microwave, Coffee Maker) matches ground truth behavior and not just labels.
  2. **Cluster Ablation:** Train one device (e.g., Coffee Maker) with K=1 (no clustering) vs. K determined by silhouette score. Plot the "Div" (Diversity RMSE) metric to confirm the paper's claim.
  3. **Resolution Sensitivity:** Generate a continuous load (e.g., Fridge) with F=10 vs F=100. Calculate Fidelity RMSE to quantify the loss of detail vs. training speedup.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can adaptive or data-driven window sizing improve CAG's performance compared to fixed-length segmentation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion lists window length L as a limitation: "quality depends on the chosen window length L."
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation uses a fixed segment length (L=436) chosen empirically; no adaptive mechanism is explored or validated.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation experiments comparing fixed vs. adaptive window selection (e.g., based on signal periodicity or change-point detection) across key fidelity and diversity metrics on multiple appliances.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can clustering be constrained to maintain performance while limiting the number of per-cluster GANs (K)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion notes: "training for each cluster increases compute when K grows;" future work suggests "budget-constrained clustering."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper validates silhouette-based K selection but does not investigate trade-offs between cluster count, computational budget, and generation quality.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Controlled experiments varying a budget hyperparameter (e.g., max K or total parameters) and measuring quality degradation vs. compute savings; or a regularized clustering objective that balances cluster cohesion with model complexity.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can learned feature extractors replace handcrafted shape features without sacrificing interpretability or performance?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion identifies "handcrafted shape features may bias motif discovery" and proposes "learned feature extractors" as future work.
- **Why unresolved:** Current clustering relies on manually defined statistical, spectral, and morphological features; end-to-end learned representations are untested.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study where a learned encoder (e.g., small CNN or autoencoder) replaces the handcrafted feature extractor, evaluated on clustering quality, downstream generation metrics, and qualitative interpretability.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does CAG generalize to other energy datasets with different sampling rates, appliance types, or behavioral distributions?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] While future work mentions "cross-dataset synthetic data generation," all experiments use only the UVIC dataset; generalizability is unstated.
- **Why unresolved:** The framework's components (routing thresholds, clustering, architecture choices) are tuned on UVIC; sensitivity to domain shift is unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmark CAG on at least one additional public NILM dataset (e.g., REDD, UK-DALE) with minimal hyperparameter retuning, reporting the same realism and diversity metrics to assess robustness.

## Limitations

- **Architectural Details:** Critical hyperparameters for the continuous branch (LSTM layer count, hidden dimensions) and the Feature FID feature extractor Φ are unspecified, making exact reproduction challenging.
- **Dataset Accessibility:** The UVIC dataset URL and precise preprocessing steps beyond basic segmentation are not provided, creating a significant barrier to validation.
- **Model Scalability:** While K-means clustering is shown to improve coverage, the paper does not analyze the performance degradation or computational cost as K scales with dataset size or appliance complexity.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core hypothesis that routing devices to architecture-specialized branches (CNN for intermittent, LSTM for continuous) improves fidelity is well-supported by the ablation study and aligns with established deep learning principles.
- **Medium Confidence:** The mechanism of K-means clustering to prevent mode collapse is compelling and empirically validated within the paper's ablation study. However, the universal applicability of this approach to all multimodal appliances is not proven.
- **Low Confidence:** The effectiveness of the sequence compression (downsampling factor F) for all continuous appliances is assumed but not rigorously tested across a range of signal types or F values.

## Next Checks

1. **Router Validation:** Implement the lightweight classifier (Eq. 1-2) and verify its routing decisions on the UVIC test set. Confirm that the binary classification of "Intermittent" vs. "Continuous" aligns with the ground truth behavioral patterns of devices like Microwaves and Fridges, not just their nominal labels.
2. **Cluster Ablation Test:** Select a single multimodal appliance (e.g., Coffee Maker). Train two versions: one with K=1 (no clustering) and one with K optimized via silhouette score. Directly compare the "Div" (Diversity RMSE) metric to quantify the paper's claim about clustering preventing mode collapse.
3. **Resolution Sensitivity Analysis:** Generate synthetic profiles for a continuous load (e.g., Fridge) using different downsampling factors (F=10, F=50, F=100). Calculate and compare the Fidelity RMSE to establish the trade-off curve between training stability and output resolution.
