# Robust Learnability of Sample-Compressible Distributions under Noisy or Adversarial Perturbations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.06613
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06613
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Sample-compressible distributions remain learnable under additive noise or adversarial perturbations with quantifiable sample complexity increases.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes that sample-compressible distribution families remain learnable from noisy or adversarially perturbed samples, with quantifiable increases in sample complexity. The key innovation is a perturbation-quantization framework that interfaces naturally with sample compression schemes. Under additive noise, the required sample complexity increases by a factor scaling with noise level and compression scheme parameters. For adversarial corruption, the increase scales with the corruption budget and ambient dimension. The framework requires minimal assumptions and applies to a broad class of parametric distributions.

## Method Summary
The method extends sample compression learnability to perturbed settings through a perturbation-quantization framework. For additive noise, samples are first "denoised" using a quantized grid of possible noise values, then passed to the sample compression decoder. For adversarial corruption, samples are partitioned into groups where at least one group remains uncorrupted, and hypotheses are selected from clean groups using a clique-finding algorithm. The approach requires minimal assumptions: local Lipschitz decodability and, for noise, a low-frequency property of the noise kernel.

## Key Results
- Sample-compressible distributions remain learnable under both additive noise and adversarial perturbations
- Sample complexity increases by factor scaling with noise level and compression parameters (additive noise) or corruption budget and ambient dimension (adversarial)
- Framework applies to mixtures of uniform distributions and Gaussian mixture models under both perturbation types
- Resolves open problems in learning under perturbations for these distribution families

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Perturbation-Quantization Interface
Noisy or corrupted samples can be "denoised" within the compression scheme by enumerating likely perturbation values. The method constructs a fine-grained grid of possible noise values and appends "denoising bits" to the sample compression scheme to specify which grid point corrects the sample. Core assumption: noise distribution is bounded or falls off exponentially, allowing finite grid approximation.

### Mechanism 2: Local Lipschitz Decodability
A sample compression scheme must be stable; small errors in input samples must result in small errors in the output distribution. The framework relies on decoders where small input perturbations yield proportionally small output errors. Core assumption: distribution class admits a smooth decoder that isn't infinitely sensitive to sample perturbations.

### Mechanism 3: Pigeonhole Clique Selection
An adversary can corrupt a subset of samples but cannot corrupt the majority without exceeding the corruption budget. The learner partitions samples into groups such that at least one group remains clean, then uses a clique-finding algorithm to identify and select hypotheses from clean groups. Core assumption: number of corruptions is less than half the sample size.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Sample Compression Schemes (Littlestone & Warmuth)** - Why needed: Paper is built on extending sample compression definition of learnability. Quick check: Can you explain why a "decoder" needs samples and bits to reconstruct a distribution?
- **Concept: Total Variation (TV) vs. ℓ₂ Distance** - Why needed: Paper provides different guarantees for different metrics. Quick check: Why does the "Low-Frequency Property" matter for ℓ₂ norm but not TV recovery?
- **Concept: Convolution and Frequency Domain Analysis** - Why needed: Additive noise analysis relies on convolution properties and frequency domain behavior. Quick check: If noise kernel flattens at low frequencies, would reconstruction be possible?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map:** Input Module -> Quantization Layer -> Decoder Bank -> Validator/Selector
- **Critical Path:** Interaction between Quantization Layer and Decoder - grid resolution must balance error reduction against bit budget explosion
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Grid resolution vs. complexity; robustness vs. generality
- **Failure Signatures:** Singularity collapse when parameters approach degeneracy; dimensionality explosion in high dimensions
- **First 3 Experiments:**
  1. Sanity check: Implement decoder for Axis-Aligned Gaussians and verify noise recovery
  2. Stress test: Implement "Clique Finder" on 1D Uniform distribution with adversarial outliers
  3. Ablation: Break Lipschitz assumption with narrow peak distribution and show sample complexity failure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can sufficient conditions for learnability under perturbations be relaxed or fully characterized? Section 5.1 states this as a key open problem, noting current results only establish minimax necessity in limited cases.

### Open Question 2
Are Local Lipschitz Decodability and Low-Frequency Property logically related or derivable from one another? The paper asks whether assumptions can be derived from each other but finds no logical implications.

### Open Question 3
Can sample complexity bounds under adversarial perturbations be improved? Current bounds have quadratic dependence on corruption count and linear dependence on dimension, which the paper suggests may be improvable with different adversary models.

### Open Question 4
Do efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms exist for learning under adversarial perturbations? The paper notes extending results to efficient algorithms remains an open challenge, particularly for high dimensions.

## Limitations

- Framework excludes distribution families with singular behavior (uniform distributions with arbitrarily small support, nearly-degenerate Gaussians)
- Noise kernel assumptions may be violated for noise distributions with significant high-frequency energy
- Adversarial framework requires s < n/2 and bounded corruption budget C
- High-dimensional implementation may be impractical due to exponential dependence on ambient dimension

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Perturbation-quantization framework interface with sample compression; proof techniques for additive noise; adversarial clique selection algorithm

**Medium Confidence:** Sample complexity bounds for concrete families; extension to noisy k-GMMs with unknown σ*

**Low Confidence:** Practical implementation for high-dimensional distributions (d >> 1) due to exponential hypothesis growth

## Next Checks

1. **Lipschitz Assumption Verification:** Systematically test Assumption 2.1 for various distribution families, quantifying Lipschitz constant scaling as parameters approach singularities

2. **Noise Model Robustness:** Extend Fourier analysis to additional noise kernels beyond Gaussian and Laplace, testing performance when Low-Frequency Property is violated

3. **Adversarial Budget Scaling:** Conduct experiments measuring sample complexity and reconstruction quality degradation as corruption budget increases toward n/2 threshold
