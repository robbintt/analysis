core_contribution: This paper tackles the problem of causal representation learning
  (CRL) from heterogeneous datasets, where the goal is to identify latent causal features
  and their causal relationships from observed data that is linearly mixed from these
  latent variables. The authors relax some stringent assumptions made in prior work,
  specifically on the noise distributions across environments, while still ensuring
  identifiability of the latent features and causal graph up to a certain equivalence
  class.

# Linear Causal Representation Learning by Topological Ordering, Pruning, and Disentanglement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.22553
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22553
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: CREATOR algorithm recovers latent causal features and relationships from linearly mixed data across heterogeneous environments, relaxing noise distribution assumptions while maintaining identifiability.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses causal representation learning from heterogeneous datasets where latent causal variables are linearly mixed and observed across multiple environments. The authors propose CREATOR, an algorithm that infers topological ordering of latent variables, prunes spurious edges, and disentangles recovered features. Unlike prior work requiring identical noise distributions across environments, CREATOR leverages topological ordering to align noise components without this stringent assumption, making the approach more practically applicable while preserving identifiability guarantees.

## Method Summary
CREATOR operates in three main phases: first, it infers a topological ordering of latent variables and recovers them up to an equivalence relation using a linear representation learning approach that aligns noise components across environments; second, it prunes spurious edges from the initially dense causal DAG using a statistical test based on the learned topological ordering; finally, it disentangles the recovered latent features through an additional optimization step. The key innovation is the noise alignment technique that relaxes the requirement for identical noise distributions across environments while maintaining the ability to identify latent features and their causal relationships up to a certain equivalence class.

## Key Results
- CREATOR outperforms LiNGCReL on synthetic data, achieving lower Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) for causal DAG recovery and higher Local R-squared (LocR2) for latent feature recovery
- The algorithm successfully recovers expected causal structures from story data when applied to analyze latent mechanisms in large language models
- Theoretical analysis establishes consistency of CREATOR under conditions of linear mixing, no latent confounders, and acyclic causal graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CREATOR exploits the structure of heterogeneous datasets across multiple environments. By leveraging the fact that causal relationships remain invariant while noise distributions may vary, the algorithm uses topological ordering to align noise components across environments without requiring identical distributions. This alignment enables the recovery of latent causal features and their relationships even when the mixing process and noise characteristics differ across environments. The pruning step then removes spurious edges that don't satisfy the causal constraints imposed by the topological ordering, while the final disentanglement step ensures the recovered features are properly separated.

## Foundational Learning

**Linear Causal Models** - Why needed: Forms the basis for representing how latent variables causally influence each other through linear relationships. Quick check: Verify that the mixing process can be adequately modeled as linear combinations of latent variables.

**Topological Ordering** - Why needed: Provides a partial ordering of variables that respects causal dependencies, enabling consistent identification of causal structure. Quick check: Confirm that the true causal graph is acyclic and compatible with the inferred ordering.

**Heterogeneous Environments** - Why needed: Multiple environments provide the variation needed to identify causal relationships invariant across settings. Quick check: Ensure sufficient environmental diversity while maintaining causal invariance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Heterogeneous Datasets -> Topological Ordering Inference -> Edge Pruning -> Feature Disentanglement -> Recovered Causal DAG and Latent Features

**Critical Path**: The algorithm must first establish a valid topological ordering before pruning can occur, as pruning relies on the ordering to identify spurious edges. Feature disentanglement is the final step that operates on the pruned DAG.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Relaxing identical noise distribution assumptions increases practical applicability but may reduce robustness in highly noisy or nonlinear scenarios. The linear mixing assumption simplifies the problem but limits application to datasets where this assumption holds.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on highly nonlinear mixing processes, failure to recover structure when latent confounders are present, and degraded accuracy with insufficient environmental diversity or weak causal signals.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate topological ordering recovery on synthetic data with known ground truth structure
2. Test edge pruning performance under varying levels of noise and mixing complexity
3. Evaluate feature disentanglement quality using simulated datasets with controlled latent variable relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes linear mixing of latent variables, limiting applicability to nonlinear real-world scenarios
- Requires absence of latent confounders, which are common in practical applications
- Performance on high-dimensional data with complex noise structures remains unclear

## Confidence

High confidence in theoretical identifiability results under stated assumptions
Medium confidence in synthetic experiment results given controlled evaluation conditions
Low confidence in LLM case study due to lack of ground truth for comparison

## Next Checks

1. Test CREATOR on synthetic data with varying degrees of nonlinearity in the mixing process to assess robustness beyond the linear assumption
2. Evaluate performance on datasets with known latent confounders to verify the method's limitations in such scenarios
3. Apply CREATOR to real-world datasets with established ground truth causal structures (e.g., gene regulatory networks) to validate practical utility
