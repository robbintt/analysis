# Relative Entropy Regularized Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Encrypted Policy Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12358
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: RERL's linear and min-free structure enables efficient encrypted policy synthesis without intermediate re-encryption

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Encrypted RERL, a privacy-preserving framework that combines relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The key insight is that RERL's structural properties (linearity and absence of min operations) allow encrypted computation to proceed efficiently without the re-encryption overhead that plagues other RL algorithms under FHE. The framework enables outsourcing sensitive model-based RL computations to untrusted servers while maintaining privacy. The authors provide theoretical analysis of error propagation from encryption-induced errors and validate their approach through Grid-World experiments, demonstrating that increasing scaling factors reduces encryption errors while computation time scales with state space size and security parameters.

## Method Summary
Encrypted RERL integrates relative-entropy-regularized RL with fully homomorphic encryption by exploiting RERL's mathematical structure. The approach leverages RERL's linear formulations and absence of min operations, which eliminates the need for intermediate re-encryption steps that typically bottleneck encrypted RL computations. The framework analyzes error propagation from two main sources: quantization errors from representing real values as integers and bootstrapping errors inherent to FHE schemes. The authors derive convergence bounds that account for these encryption-induced errors and demonstrate the approach on Grid-World environments where they systematically vary scaling factors to study the trade-off between accuracy and computational overhead.

## Key Results
- RERL's linear and min-free structure eliminates intermediate re-encryption, achieving computational efficiency
- Error analysis shows encryption-induced errors decrease with larger scaling factors while computation time increases
- Grid-World experiments validate the framework, with performance scaling predictably with state space size and security parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works because RERL's mathematical formulation naturally aligns with FHE constraints. RERL uses entropy regularization that results in linear policy improvement steps, avoiding the non-linear operations (particularly min/max functions) that are expensive or impossible to compute directly on encrypted data. This structural advantage means the encrypted computation can proceed through a single encryption at the start and decryption at the end, rather than requiring multiple encryption/decryption cycles. The framework's efficiency gains come from this elimination of intermediate re-encryption steps, while the error analysis provides theoretical bounds on how encryption noise affects policy convergence.

## Foundational Learning
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Allows computation on encrypted data without decryption, enabling privacy-preserving outsourcing. Why needed: Core technology enabling encrypted RL computation.
- Relative Entropy Regularization: Adds KL-divergence penalty to encourage policy updates to stay close to previous policies. Why needed: Creates the linear structure that makes encrypted computation tractable.
- Quantization Error: Loss of precision when converting real numbers to fixed-point integers for FHE. Why needed: Primary source of approximation error in encrypted computation.
- Bootstrapping Error: Noise introduced during FHE refresh operations to maintain ciphertext validity. Why needed: Secondary source of error that accumulates during computation.
- Convergence Analysis with Noise: Mathematical framework for analyzing RL algorithm convergence when computation includes approximation errors. Why needed: Ensures privacy-preserving computation doesn't compromise learning quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
FHE-Encrypted State Space -> RERL Policy Iteration -> FHE-Encrypted Value Function -> Policy Evaluation

Critical path:
1. Encrypt initial state representation and policy parameters
2. Execute RERL policy iteration steps (linear operations only)
3. Evaluate policy through encrypted value function computation
4. Decrypt final policy for deployment

Design tradeoffs:
- Scaling factor selection: Larger values reduce quantization error but increase computation time and ciphertext size
- Security parameter vs. efficiency: Higher security requires more computation but provides stronger privacy guarantees
- State space discretization: Finer discretization improves accuracy but exponentially increases computational requirements

Failure signatures:
- Policy divergence: Indicates error accumulation exceeding theoretical bounds
- Excessive computation time: Suggests inappropriate scaling factor or security parameter choices
- Numerical instability: May result from improper handling of encrypted arithmetic operations

First 3 experiments to run:
1. Grid-World with varying scaling factors to empirically validate error-reduction claims
2. State space size scaling experiments to verify computational complexity predictions
3. Comparison of encrypted vs. plaintext RERL performance to quantify privacy-preserving overhead

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Scalability to high-dimensional continuous control tasks remains unproven beyond simple Grid-World environments
- Parameter selection for scaling factors and security parameters lacks systematic guidance for new applications
- Error analysis assumptions based on RERL's specific structure may not extend to other RL algorithms

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the theoretical error bounds and convergence analysis, as these follow established mathematical frameworks for both FHE and RERL

**Medium confidence** in the computational efficiency claims, given the limited experimental scope to small discrete environments

**Low confidence** in the general applicability to complex RL problems without further validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on continuous control benchmarks (e.g., MuJoCo or PyBullet environments) to evaluate scalability and error behavior in high-dimensional state spaces

2. Implement systematic parameter selection methods for scaling factors and security parameters across different problem domains

3. Compare performance against alternative privacy-preserving RL approaches on identical tasks to benchmark efficiency gains
