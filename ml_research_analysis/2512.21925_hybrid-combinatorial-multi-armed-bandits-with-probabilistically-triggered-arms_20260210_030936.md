# Hybrid Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.21925
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21925
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces hybrid learning framework combining online exploration with offline data via dual confidence bounds for CMAB-T problems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel hybrid learning framework for combinatorial multi-armed bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (H-CMAB-T) that bridges the gap between purely online and purely offline learning approaches. The framework addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging informative offline data to reduce exploration costs while maintaining adaptability through online learning. The core contribution is the hybrid CUCB algorithm, which uses a dual confidence bound mechanism to adaptively balance trust between offline and online feedback based on estimated bias. Theoretical analysis establishes regret bounds that demonstrate improved performance over purely online approaches when reliable offline data is available, with a data-dependent saving term that quantifies the benefit of leveraging historical information.

## Method Summary
The hybrid learning framework combines online exploration with offline data through a dual confidence bound mechanism. The approach uses offline data to inform initial exploration while maintaining adaptability through online learning. The algorithm estimates the bias between offline and online distributions and adjusts confidence bounds accordingly. The framework introduces a data-dependent saving term that captures the benefit of leveraging historical information. Theoretical analysis provides both gap-dependent and gap-independent regret bounds that depend on the quality of offline data. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent advantages over purely online approaches when offline data is reliable.

## Key Results
- Theoretical regret bounds show improved performance over purely online approaches when informative offline data is available
- Data-dependent saving term quantifies the benefit of leveraging historical information
- Empirical results on synthetic and MovieLens datasets demonstrate consistent advantages of the hybrid approach
- Robust performance under distributional bias when offline data is reliable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid approach works by combining the strengths of both online and offline learning. Online learning provides adaptability to changing environments and unbiased feedback, while offline learning offers the benefit of historical data to reduce exploration costs. The dual confidence bound mechanism allows the algorithm to adaptively weigh online and offline feedback based on their estimated reliability. When offline data is highly informative and unbiased, the algorithm can significantly reduce exploration costs by leveraging this information. The bias estimation component ensures that the algorithm remains robust even when the offline data distribution differs from the online environment. This adaptive weighting mechanism enables the algorithm to achieve better performance than either purely online or purely offline approaches in scenarios where informative historical data is available.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Offline Data Storage -> Bias Estimator -> Confidence Bound Constructor -> Hybrid CUCB Algorithm -> Arm Selection -> Reward Feedback -> Online Learner

Critical Path:
Bias estimation and confidence bound construction are the most critical components. The algorithm's performance heavily depends on accurate bias estimation and proper weighting of online vs offline confidence bounds.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Accuracy vs computational complexity in bias estimation
- Sensitivity to offline data quality vs robustness to noise
- Exploration-exploitation balance between online and offline information sources

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance when offline data bias is severely underestimated
- Over-reliance on noisy offline data leading to suboptimal arm selections
- Failure to adapt when online environment significantly differs from offline data distribution

First Experiments:
1. Test algorithm on synthetic data with known bias to verify bias estimation accuracy
2. Evaluate performance degradation as offline data quality decreases
3. Compare hybrid approach against purely online and purely offline baselines under varying bias conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Performance critically depends on the quality and bias of offline data, which may be challenging to estimate accurately in practice
- Theoretical guarantees assume specific conditions on offline data distribution that may not hold for arbitrary datasets
- Gap-dependent regret bound requires knowledge of problem-specific gaps that might not be available in real-world applications
- Empirical evaluation may not fully capture algorithm behavior in diverse real-world scenarios

## Confidence
High: Theoretical framework is sound and well-established
Medium: Empirical validation is promising but limited in scope
Low: Claims about robustness under distributional bias lack comprehensive theoretical analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on a wider range of real-world datasets with varying levels of bias and data quality to validate robustness claims
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component of the hybrid approach and identify critical factors for success
3. Develop methods to automatically estimate the quality and bias of offline data without prior knowledge, addressing practical deployment challenges
