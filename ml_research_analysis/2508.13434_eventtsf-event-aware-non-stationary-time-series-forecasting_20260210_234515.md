## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating textual events into time series forecasting for non-stationary dynamics. The proposed EventTSF framework introduces an autoregressive diffusion architecture with event-controlled flow matching timesteps and a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer to capture fine-grained temporal-event interactions and handle event-induced uncertainty. Extensive experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, with peak gains of 47% accuracy on event-rich datasets.

## Method Summary
EventTSF is an autoregressive diffusion-based framework that integrates textual event information into time series forecasting. The architecture employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that processes both time series data and event embeddings through a shared attention mechanism. The key innovation lies in the event-controlled flow matching that adjusts diffusion timesteps based on event occurrences, allowing the model to capture non-stationary dynamics induced by external events. The framework uses a multimodal transformer encoder to fuse temporal and textual information, followed by a decoder that generates forecasts while accounting for event-driven uncertainty.

## Key Results
- 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy compared to 12 baseline methods
- 1.13× faster training efficiency than existing approaches
- 47% accuracy gains on event-rich datasets
- 51.2% better deterministic forecasting performance in peak cases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging diffusion models' ability to handle uncertainty while incorporating event information through multimodal fusion. The autoregressive nature allows sequential dependency modeling, while the event-controlled flow matching adapts the diffusion process to significant temporal changes. The U-shaped transformer architecture enables multi-scale feature extraction from both time series and event data, capturing complex interactions between external events and temporal dynamics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion models**: Generative models that learn to denoise data progressively; needed for handling uncertainty in non-stationary environments; quick check: understand the forward and reverse diffusion processes
- **Autoregressive forecasting**: Sequential prediction where each step depends on previous predictions; needed for temporal dependency modeling; quick check: verify the model can handle multi-step forecasting
- **Multimodal fusion**: Combining information from different data modalities (time series and text); needed to integrate event information; quick check: ensure proper alignment between temporal and textual data
- **Flow matching**: A technique for training diffusion models by matching probability flows; needed for stable training; quick check: understand how event-controlled timesteps modify standard flow matching
- **U-shaped architectures**: Encoder-decoder structures with skip connections; needed for multi-scale feature extraction; quick check: verify the skip connections properly preserve temporal information
- **Attention mechanisms**: Self-attention and cross-attention for capturing relationships; needed for multimodal interaction modeling; quick check: understand how temporal and textual attention interact

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: EventTSF -> Multimodal U-Net Transformer -> Event-Controlled Flow Matching -> Autoregressive Forecasting

**Critical Path**: Time series input and event text → Multimodal encoder (temporal and textual feature extraction) → Event-controlled flow matching (adaptive diffusion timesteps) → Multimodal U-Net decoder (multi-scale feature processing) → Forecast output generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for improved accuracy by using diffusion models and multimodal fusion. While this increases training time, the reported 1.13× faster training efficiency suggests optimizations were effective. The choice of U-shaped architecture balances feature extraction depth with information preservation through skip connections.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include: (1) Poor event-text alignment leading to irrelevant information fusion, (2) Overfitting to specific event patterns in training data, (3) Diffusion instability when event density is too high or too low, (4) Attention collapse where one modality dominates the other.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study removing event information to quantify its contribution to forecasting accuracy
2. Sensitivity analysis varying the event-controlled flow matching parameters to find optimal configurations
3. Cross-dataset validation testing performance when training on one domain and testing on another

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset generalizability concerns due to heavy focus on text-rich event domains
- Computational overhead characterization needs more detailed analysis, particularly for inference costs
- Limited evaluation of uncertainty quantification quality and calibration metrics

## Confidence
- 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy (High)
- 1.13× faster training efficiency (Medium)
- 47% accuracy gains on event-rich datasets (High)
- 51.2% better deterministic forecasting performance (Medium)

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain robustness test: Evaluate EventTSF on datasets from domains with implicit events (e.g., sensor data, financial transactions without news) to assess generalization beyond text-rich event sources.

2. Computational efficiency benchmark: Conduct head-to-head comparisons measuring total computational cost (training + inference) against leading baselines across different hardware configurations and batch sizes.

3. Uncertainty calibration analysis: Perform proper scoring rule evaluation (e.g., CRPS, interval score) and reliability diagram analysis to verify that the diffusion-based uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated, particularly for extreme events.
