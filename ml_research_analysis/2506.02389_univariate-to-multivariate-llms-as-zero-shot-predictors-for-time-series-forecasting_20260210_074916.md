# Univariate to Multivariate: LLMs as Zero-Shot Predictors for Time-Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02389
- Authors: Chamara Madarasingha; Nasrin Sohrabi; Zahir Tari
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMPred achieves 26.8% MSE reduction for univariate forecasting and 17.4% improvement for multivariate prediction using smaller LLMs

## Executive Summary
LLMPred introduces a framework that transforms time-series forecasting into a text-based prediction task using large language models. The key innovation lies in converting numerical time-series data into text prompts through frequency decomposition, enabling LLMs to predict future values without task-specific training. By decomposing univariate sequences into low- and high-frequency components and employing a lightweight prompt-processing strategy, the framework extends naturally from univariate to multivariate forecasting scenarios.

## Method Summary
The framework addresses the challenge of applying LLMs to time-series forecasting by converting numerical data into text-based prompts. The core approach involves frequency decomposition of univariate sequences, splitting them into low-frequency (trend) and high-frequency (noise) components. These components are then encoded into text prompts that LLMs can process. For multivariate forecasting, the framework uses a lightweight prompt-processing strategy that leverages the univariate prediction capability. The approach is tested with smaller LLMs like Llama 2/3, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while requiring no task-specific training.

## Key Results
- 26.8% reduction in MSE compared to state-of-the-art baselines for univariate forecasting
- 17.4% improvement when extending from univariate to multivariate prediction
- Competitive or superior performance using smaller LLMs (Llama 2/3, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek) compared to larger models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging LLMs' strong pattern recognition capabilities through a novel text encoding of time-series data. Frequency decomposition separates temporal patterns into interpretable components, making the prediction task more manageable for language models. The text prompt format allows LLMs to apply their natural language understanding capabilities to numerical sequences, effectively treating time-series prediction as a language generation task. This zero-shot approach eliminates the need for model fine-tuning while maintaining competitive accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Frequency decomposition** - Separating time-series into low-frequency (trend) and high-frequency (noise) components. Why needed: Simplifies the prediction task by isolating different temporal patterns. Quick check: Verify decomposition preserves signal integrity and captures meaningful patterns.

2. **Text-based time-series encoding** - Converting numerical sequences into text prompts. Why needed: Enables LLMs to process time-series data using their natural language capabilities. Quick check: Ensure encoding maintains temporal relationships and numerical precision.

3. **Zero-shot prediction** - Using pre-trained LLMs without task-specific fine-tuning. Why needed: Reduces computational overhead and eliminates need for labeled training data. Quick check: Validate that pre-trained language understanding transfers to numerical forecasting.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Time-series data -> Frequency decomposition -> Text encoding -> LLM prediction -> Result reconstruction
**Critical path**: The frequency decomposition and text encoding stages are critical, as errors here propagate directly to prediction quality.
**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Frequency decomposition provides better pattern separation but adds preprocessing complexity
- Text encoding enables LLM usage but may lose some numerical precision
- Zero-shot approach saves training resources but may underperform specialized models on some tasks

**Failure signatures**:
- Poor decomposition parameters leading to signal distortion
- Tokenization issues causing loss of temporal relationships
- Context window limitations for long sequences
- LLM misunderstanding numerical patterns in text format

**First experiments**:
1. Test frequency decomposition accuracy on synthetic signals with known patterns
2. Validate text encoding preserves numerical relationships through round-trip conversion
3. Benchmark LLM prediction accuracy on simple periodic sequences before complex data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Data preprocessing sensitivity, particularly regarding frequency decomposition parameters and tokenization strategies
- Unclear performance boundaries for longer time-series sequences given LLM context window constraints
- Limited validation across diverse real-world domains with varying noise characteristics and seasonality patterns

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Core architectural contribution and empirical improvements for tested scenarios
**Medium confidence**: Competitive performance claims with smaller LLMs may not generalize to all forecasting scenarios
**Low confidence**: Scalability assertions for multivariate forecasting need more extensive validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset stress testing**: Evaluate across at least 10 diverse real-world time-series datasets spanning different domains to assess robustness to varying data characteristics and noise profiles.

2. **Long-sequence benchmarking**: Systematically test performance degradation with increasing sequence lengths (up to model context limits) to establish clear boundaries for practical deployment.

3. **Preprocessing sensitivity analysis**: Conduct comprehensive ablation studies varying frequency decomposition parameters, tokenization strategies, and prompt formulations to quantify their impact on forecasting accuracy.
