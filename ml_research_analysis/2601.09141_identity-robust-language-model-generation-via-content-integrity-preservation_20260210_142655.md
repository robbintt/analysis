# Identity-Robust Language Model Generation via Content Integrity Preservation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.09141
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09141
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: 77.4% average reduction in identity-dependent disparities using training-free query-level identity control

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses sociodemographic disparities in LLM outputs where user identity cues in prompts lead to variations in factual accuracy, utility, and safety. The authors demonstrate that while LLMs maintain stable internal factual representations across identities, the generation process is influenced by identity cues. They propose Identity-Robust Generation (IRG), a lightweight, training-free framework that controls how identity information enters the generation process through three stages: relevance analysis, identity-neutral content generation, and controlled personalization with verification. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities show IRG achieves substantial bias reduction while preserving answer quality.

## Method Summary
IRG is a training-free, three-stage framework for identity-robust LLM generation. Stage 1 uses GLiNER2 for entity detection and LLM-based counterfactual analysis to classify identity terms as critical or non-critical to the question's answer. Stage 2 generates identity-neutral content by removing non-critical identity terms before generation. Stage 3 (optional) applies controlled personalization for stylistic adaptation while verifying semantic consistency. The method operates at query level without model fine-tuning, preserving task-specific answer quality while reducing sociodemographic disparities in outputs.

## Key Results
- 77.4% average reduction in identity-dependent disparities across all benchmarks compared to vanilla prompting
- 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses
- Preserves task-specific answer quality (matches "No Identity" baseline on all benchmarks)
- Enables controlled stylistic adaptation while maintaining low bias (Flesch-Kincaid readability differences of 3.6-5.7 vs 0.6-1.3 for unconstrained style prompting)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Identity cues bias the generation process without corrupting internal factual representations.
- **Mechanism**: LLMs encode knowledge stably in attention heads, but the generation head modulates output based on context signals (including identity cues). Identity information influences which tokens are selected during decoding, not what the model "knows."
- **Evidence**: Probe accuracy on attention heads shows 86-87% accuracy with CV of only 0.33% across identities, while generation accuracy varies up to 3.8% (CV 1.12%).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Selectively neutralizing non-critical identity information before generation preserves answer quality while reducing disparities.
- **Mechanism**: A counterfactual relevance check determines whether removing an identity term would change the information required to answer. Non-critical terms are removed from the query before generation, preventing identity from influencing content while preserving semantically essential attributes.
- **Evidence**: Manual inspection of 500 samples shows 98.8% agreement rate between rewritten queries and human judgments.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Controlled personalization with content verification enables stylistic adaptation without reintroducing content drift.
- **Mechanism**: After generating identity-neutral content, an optional step reintroduces identity for presentation-level adjustments (e.g., readability). A verification step checks semantic consistency; if discrepancies exist, the neutral response is used instead.
- **Evidence**: Controlled personalization achieves substantial readability adaptation while maintaining low bias, with performance matching "No Identity" baseline on all benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Probing internal representations**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the paper's motivation requires grasping that LLMs can encode knowledge they don't express, and that probes can reveal this gap.
  - Quick check question: If a model answers incorrectly but a trained probe on its attention heads predicts the correct answer with high accuracy, what does this suggest about where the failure occurs?

- **Concept: Counterfactual reasoning for relevance analysis**
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 uses LLM-based counterfactual checks ("would removing this term change required information?"); understanding this abstraction is essential for implementation.
  - Quick check question: For the query "As a Jewish person, what holidays involve fasting?", is the identity term critical or non-critical, and why?

- **Concept: Generation-time vs. training-time interventions**
  - Why needed here: IRG is explicitly training-free; contrast with methods like DPO, RLHF, or activation steering clarifies the design philosophy and constraints.
  - Quick check question: What are the tradeoffs of a training-free approach compared to fine-tuning for bias mitigation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Query input → GLiNER2 NER detection → LLM counterfactual relevance check (CRITICAL vs NON-CRITICAL) → Query rewriter (mask/remove NON-CRITICAL terms) → Core generator → (Optional) Personalizer + Verifier

- **Critical path**: Query input → NER detection → Relevance check → Query rewrite → Generation. The relevance decision at Step 2 is the key branch point; errors here propagate.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Conservative classification (treat uncertain as CRITICAL) preserves content but may retain biasing cues; aggressive removal risks losing semantically necessary identity information; Stage 3 personalization adds latency and verification complexity for stylistic benefits.

- **Failure signatures**: Removing critical identity terms (e.g., "woman" from gender-specific health question) → wrong answers; retaining irrelevant terms (e.g., "full-time worker" in unrelated questions) → residual bias; verification false negatives → overly conservative fallback to neutral answers.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Probe replication: Train linear probes on attention head activations for True/False classification on TruthfulQA; verify low variance across identity conditions. 2) Relevance analysis accuracy: Sample 100 queries with identity spans; manually annotate critical vs non-critical; compare against LLM counterfactual predictions. 3) Ablation on personalization: Compare identity-neutral generation vs full pipeline with Stage 3 on readability metrics and bias scores.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited corpus validation of core mechanisms (counterfactual relevance check and semantic verification)
- Training-free approach constraints prevent learning complex identity-robust patterns from data
- Verification mechanism opacity - underspecified semantic consistency checking

## Confidence
- **Identity Robustness Claims**: High
- **Mechanism 1 - Internal Knowledge Stability**: High
- **Mechanism 2 - Counterfactual Relevance**: Medium
- **Mechanism 3 - Controlled Personalization**: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Probe accuracy variance validation: Replicate the probing experiment across all 18 identities on all three models to verify the claimed 86-87% accuracy with minimal CV (0.33%).
2. Relevance classification ablation: Implement controlled experiment removing the counterfactual relevance check entirely versus IRG approach; measure bias reduction vs content accuracy degradation.
3. Personalization drift analysis: Systematically compare personalized outputs from Stage 3 against neutral outputs using automated semantic similarity metrics and human evaluation to measure verification effectiveness.
