# Online Regularized Learning Algorithms in RKHS with $β$- and $φ$-Mixing Sequences

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.05929
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05929
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Online regularized learning in RKHS for dependent data achieves convergence rates matching i.i.d. bounds for θ ∈ (1/2, 1), with slower O(t^(-α/2)) rates at θ = 1.

## Executive Summary
This paper studies online regularized learning algorithms in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) for dependent data modeled by strictly stationary Markov chains with exponential φ- and β-mixing coefficients. The authors establish upper bounds on the error ∥f_t+1 − f_ρ∥_ρ for the learning sequence (f_t) in terms of initial and sampling errors, under two parameter regimes: θ ∈ (1/2, 1) yields convergence rate O(λ^(-τ(θ))·t^(-θ/2)) where τ(θ) = 1/[2(1-θ)] + 1/2; θ = 1 with λ < C_K² gives rate O(λ^(-1)·t^(-λ/[2(λ+C_K²)])) with convergence exponent α(λ) = λ/[2(λ+C_K²)] that increases with λ, approaching 1/2 as λ → C_K². These rates match i.i.d. rates for θ ∈ (1/2, 1), but slow to O(t^(-α/2)) at θ = 1. The analysis extends to copula-based Markov chains, showing that exponential φ-mixing ensures geometric ergodicity and analogous convergence guarantees.

## Method Summary
The method employs online gradient descent in RKHS with updates f_{t+1} = f_t - γ_t[(f_t(x_t) - y_t)K_{x_t} + λf_t], where γ_t = 1/[(λ + C_K²)t^θ]. The algorithm operates on strictly stationary Markov chains with exponential mixing coefficients, decomposing the excess error into initial and sampling components. The proof leverages strong convexity of the regularized loss, mixing properties of the Markov chain, and RKHS structure to bound both components. For copula-based chains, exponential φ-mixing guarantees geometric ergodicity, extending the convergence results to this broader class of dependent data.

## Key Results
- Convergence rates O(λ^(-τ(θ))·t^(-θ/2)) for θ ∈ (1/2, 1) match i.i.d. bounds
- At θ = 1, rates slow to O(λ^(-1)·t^(-λ/[2(λ+C_K²)])) with α(λ) < 1/2
- Copula-based Markov chains with exponential φ-mixing ensure geometric ergodicity
- Mixing coefficients D and r directly control the sampling error term 4Dr/(1-r)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Error Decomposition via Initial and Sampling Errors
The excess error ∥f_{t+1} - f_ρ∥_ρ is bounded by decomposing it into initial error (bias from initialization) and sampling error (variance from stochastic gradients). This isolates the impact of the algorithm's step-size from statistical noise. The proof separates convergence towards regularized minimizer f_{λ,μ} (handled by strong convexity) from approximation of f_{λ,μ} to true regression function f_ρ. Break condition: If loss function is not strongly convex, initial error may not decay geometrically.

### Mechanism 2: Dependence Mitigation via Mixing Rates
When data samples are dependent (Markovian), the effective sample size is reduced, but "fast" mixing (exponential decay of dependence) preserves convergence rates close to i.i.d. setting. The sampling error bound includes term 4Dr/(1-r) derived from exponential φ-mixing property. As mixing rate r → 0 (dependence vanishes quickly), this term collapses, recovering i.i.d. rate O(t^(-θ/2)). Break condition: If chain mixes slowly (polynomial mixing with k<1), convergence rate degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 3: Regularization as a Stabilizer
Regularization parameter λ ensures problem is well-conditioned (strongly convex), controlling trade-off between stability and approximation error. λ shifts eigenvalues of Hessian operator, ensuring inverses exist and gradients don't explode. However, larger λ introduces bias by pulling f_{λ,μ} away from f_ρ. Break condition: If λ is too small relative to mixing dependence, sampling error variance may dominate and diverge.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: The hypothesis space. The "kernel trick" allows gradient ∇V_z(f) to be computed as linear combination of kernel functions K(·, x_t) without explicit feature maps. Quick check: Can you explain why gradient of loss (f(x)-y)² in RKHS points in direction of kernel function K(·, x)?

- **Mixing Coefficients (φ and β-mixing)**: Quantify "how dependent" current sample is on past. Replace i.i.d. assumption to allow concentration inequalities to hold for time-series data. Quick check: Does geometric decay in mixing coefficients imply "long-term memory" or "short-term memory"?

- **Online Gradient Descent (OGD)**: The core algorithm. Unlike batch learning, it updates estimator immediately upon seeing sample, making it suitable for streaming data from Markov chain. Quick check: In Eq (5), what happens to update if step size γ_t does not decay to zero?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Source (Strictly stationary Markov Chain) -> State (Function estimator f_t ∈ H_K) -> Update Engine (Gradient descent step) -> Monitor (Error decomposition)

- **Critical path:** 1. Verify stationarity of input stream. 2. Estimate mixing rate r (or choose conservative γ_t). 3. Initialize f_1 (often 0). 4. Iterate: Receive z_t, compute gradient (kernel evaluation), update f_{t+1}.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Step-size θ: Choosing θ ∈ (1/2, 1) matches i.i.d. rates but requires careful tuning; θ=1 yields slower rates (O(t^(-α/2)) vs O(t^(-α))). Regularization λ: Large λ dampens sampling error (good for high dependence/noise) but increases approximation bias (bad for accuracy).

- **Failure signatures:** Divergence: Sampling error term grows if λ is too small for level of dependence in chain. Stagnation: Convergence stalls if step sizes γ_t decay too fast relative to information gained from dependent samples.

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Sanity Check (I.I.D. Baseline): Run algorithm on shuffled data to ensure implementation matches standard i.i.d. bounds (D=0). 2. Varying Dependence: Generate data using Copula-based Markov chain with varying φ-mixing rates (r close to 1 vs. close to 0) to observe impact on E_samp. 3. Parameter Sweep: Test θ ∈ (1/2, 1) vs θ=1 to verify theoretical slowdown at boundary case.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis hinges on strict stationarity and exponential mixing decay, assumptions that may be violated in real-world data streams
- Mixing coefficients D and r are often unknown in practice and must be estimated, introducing additional uncertainty
- At θ = 1, convergence rate O(t^(-α/2)) with α < 1/2 is significantly slower than i.i.d. rate, suggesting algorithm may be impractical for highly dependent data

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Error decomposition mechanism (initial vs. sampling error) is well-established in RKHS learning literature
- **Medium Confidence:** Extension to mixing sequences is theoretically sound but relies on technical conditions that may be difficult to verify empirically
- **Low Confidence:** Practical impact of choosing θ ∈ (1/2, 1) vs θ = 1 is not demonstrated; theoretical slowdown at θ = 1 may be overly conservative

## Next Checks
1. **Mixing Coefficient Estimation:** Generate data from known copula-based Markov chain and empirically estimate mixing coefficients β_t to verify assumed exponential decay
2. **Convergence Rate Verification:** Run algorithm with θ ∈ (1/2, 1) and θ = 1 on same dependent data, plotting log(error) vs log(t) to confirm predicted slowdown at θ = 1
3. **Stationarity Test:** Apply algorithm to non-stationary Markov chain (e.g., time-varying transition kernel) to demonstrate failure modes and validate stationarity assumption's necessity
