# Hyperdimensional Uncertainty Quantification for Multimodal Uncertainty Fusion in Autonomous Vehicles Perception

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.20011
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20011
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: HyperDUM achieves up to 2.01%/1.27% improvement in average precision and 1.29% improvement in mIoU over state-of-the-art methods while requiring 2.36× fewer FLOPs and up to 38.30× fewer parameters.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HyperDUM, a deterministic uncertainty quantification method for multimodal autonomous driving perception systems. The method leverages hyperdimensional computing to estimate epistemic uncertainty at the feature fusion level, using channel-wise and patch-wise projection techniques to capture granular uncertainties. Evaluated on 3D object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, HyperDUM demonstrates significant performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach addresses a critical need in autonomous vehicles for reliable uncertainty estimation in safety-critical perception tasks.

## Method Summary
HyperDUM quantifies epistemic uncertainty by projecting latent features from multimodal sensors into hyperdimensional space using Random Fourier Features. It creates prototypes by bundling hypervectors of training samples within the same context (e.g., weather conditions), then measures uncertainty as the set of cosine similarities between new samples and these prototypes. The method employs Channel-wise Projection & Bundling (CPB) and Patch-wise Projection & Bundling (PPB) to capture both channel-level and spatial uncertainties separately. An Uncertainty Quantification Module (UQM) reweights features based on computed uncertainties before multimodal fusion, improving downstream task performance while maintaining efficiency through deterministic computation.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 2.01% improvement in average precision for 3D object detection (aiMotive dataset)
- Achieves up to 1.27% improvement in mIoU for semantic segmentation (DeLiVer dataset)
- Requires 2.36× fewer floating point operations compared to competing methods
- Uses up to 38.30× fewer parameters while maintaining superior performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Feature-Level Epistemic Uncertainty via Hyperdimensional Prototyping
HyperDUM estimates epistemic uncertainty by projecting latent features into hyperdimensional space and measuring their similarity to learned prototypes. The method assumes that epistemic uncertainty is inversely related to similarity between a sample's representation and known prototypical representations. Low similarity to all prototypes indicates high uncertainty, signaling a sample not well-represented by training data.

### Mechanism 2: Channel and Patch-wise Uncertainty Granularity
The method decomposes feature maps into separate channel and spatial components to capture fine-grained uncertainties. CPB retains channel dimensions to acknowledge different feature channels have different uncertainties, while PPB projects spatial patches separately to capture local spatial uncertainties. This granular approach provides more accurate uncertainty signals for downstream fusion.

### Mechanism 3: Uncertainty-Aware Multimodal Feature Fusion
Computed feature-level uncertainties are used to adaptively reweight multimodal features before fusion. The uncertainty weighting module down-weights features from modalities with high uncertainty (e.g., camera in low light), leading to better fused representations than equal weighting. This approach mitigates uncertainty propagation and improves overall system robustness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty
  - Why needed: HyperDUM targets epistemic (model/data knowledge gap) uncertainty, not aleatoric (data noise). Understanding this distinction is crucial for interpreting what the method measures.
  - Quick check: If a camera image is slightly noisy due to sensor heat, is this epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty? (Answer: Aleatoric)

- **Concept**: Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) / Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)
  - Why needed: HyperDUM's core innovation applies HDC operations (projection, bundling, similarity) to UQ. Understanding HDC's high-dimensional, holographic vector representation is key to grasping prototype formation and comparison.
  - Quick check: In VSA, what does the 'bundling' operation typically do? (Answer: Combines multiple vectors into a single representative vector)

- **Concept**: Deterministic Uncertainty Methods (DUMs)
  - Why needed: HyperDUM positions itself as a DUM to contrast with expensive Bayesian methods. Understanding DUMs' single-pass efficiency advantage is crucial for appreciating the computational benefits.
  - Quick check: What is the main computational advantage of a DUM over a Bayesian approximation method like Monte Carlo Dropout? (Answer: Single-pass computation vs. multiple forward passes)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Feature Encoders -> Projection Module (CPB + PPB) -> Prototype Memory -> Uncertainty Module -> Uncertainty Weighting Module -> Fusion & Task Heads

- **Critical path**: Initialize Projection Matrix → Prototype Formation (train data through encoders/projection, bundle by context) → Inference (project features, compute similarity to prototypes → uncertainty, apply weighting, proceed to fusion)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Hyperdimension (d): Higher d increases expressiveness but also computational cost; ~10,000 suggested as plateau
  - Number of Patches (P): More patches allow finer spatial uncertainty but require lower per-patch hyperdimension to avoid overfitting
  - Prototype Granularity: Defining prototypes by broad scenarios vs. fine-grained attributes; merging unrelated attributes hurts performance

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Uncertainty constantly low/high: Indicates failure in projection or similarity calculation
  - Fusion performance degrades on known scenarios: Weighting module may be suppressing useful features
  - High FLOP overhead: Chosen hyperdimension or number of patches is too large for target hardware

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Integration: Integrate CPB and prototype formation, train on validation set, verify uncertainty values for OOD inputs
  2. Ablation Study (CPB vs. PPB): Implement both, run on test set with injected noise to confirm spatial and feature robustness
  3. Hyperparameter Sweep: Grid search over d (5000, 10000) and P (1, 4, 16) to identify optimal accuracy-efficiency tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The authors identify reliance on labels for supervised prototype learning as the "primary limitation" and explicitly leave exploration of semi-supervised and unsupervised versions for future work.
- FLOPs "may be further reduced due to the massively parallel operations" of hyperdimensional computation, but these optimizations were not implemented in the current GPU-based evaluation.
- There is no theoretical framework provided for determining optimal hyperdimension and patch count to maximize expressivity without inducing detrimental sparsity.

## Limitations
- The prototype formation process assumes scenarios can be cleanly separated into discrete categories, which may not capture the continuous nature of real-world uncertainty.
- The computational efficiency claims rely on fixed hyperdimension values without exploring the full tradeoff space between accuracy and efficiency.
- The method's performance on real embedded hardware under actual deployment constraints remains unverified.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Performance improvements over baselines (2.01%/1.27% AP/mIoU gains) are directly measurable from reported metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Architectural innovation of combining CPB and PPB is supported by ablation studies
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about efficiency enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained AV systems lack empirical validation on actual embedded hardware

## Next Checks
1. Create synthetic datasets where uncertainty attributes overlap across scenarios and measure if HyperDUM's prototype-based uncertainty correctly identifies ambiguous cases versus confident misclassifications
2. Deploy HyperDUM on representative AV hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Orin) and measure actual inference latency, memory usage, and power consumption under real-time constraints
3. Evaluate HyperDUM's uncertainty estimates on datasets from different geographic regions or sensor configurations to assess whether prototypes learned from one domain generalize to novel environments
