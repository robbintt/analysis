- Introduces Prophet Arena, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs as forecasting agents using prediction market events

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-as-a-Prophet, a comprehensive framework for evaluating large language models' ability to forecast real-world events. The authors build Prophet Arena, a live benchmark that collects prediction market events and decomposes forecasting into three modular stages: event extraction, context construction, and probabilistic prediction. Across 1,300+ resolved events, the study evaluates models along three complementary dimensions—Brier score (forecasting loss), calibration error, and market return (economic value). The research establishes a rigorous, extensible testbed for studying predictive intelligence and highlights both emerging strengths and persistent limitations of LLMs as forecasting agents.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates LLM forecasting through three modular stages: event extraction (identifying relevant events from market data), context construction (gathering supporting information and evidence), and probabilistic prediction (generating calibrated probability estimates). The benchmark uses 1,300+ resolved prediction market events to create a standardized evaluation environment. Models are assessed using Brier scores for forecasting accuracy, calibration error for reliability of probability estimates, and market returns to measure economic value. The modular decomposition allows for systematic analysis of bottlenecks in each stage of the forecasting process.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve lower calibration errors than prediction markets but higher Brier scores in short-term forecasting
- Performance degrades near event resolution, with significant drops in accuracy during high-volatility periods
- Economic returns from LLM predictions lag behind prediction market returns, indicating practical limitations
- Bottlenecks identified in event recall, source usage, and information aggregation across modular stages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the complex forecasting task into manageable stages that mirror human reasoning processes. Event extraction identifies relevant targets, context construction gathers supporting evidence through information retrieval, and probabilistic prediction synthesizes this information into calibrated forecasts. This modular approach allows for targeted analysis of each component's contribution to overall performance, revealing where LLMs excel (calibration) and where they struggle (short-term accuracy and economic value). The use of prediction markets as ground truth provides a standardized, real-world benchmark that captures both accuracy and market-informed probabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prediction Markets** - Why needed: Provide ground truth probabilities and real-world forecasting benchmarks. Quick check: Compare market-implied probabilities with actual outcomes across multiple events.
- **Brier Score** - Why needed: Measures forecast accuracy through squared error between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. Quick check: Calculate Brier scores for binary and multi-class events to ensure proper normalization.
- **Calibration Error** - Why needed: Evaluates reliability of probability estimates beyond simple accuracy. Quick check: Bin predictions by confidence and compare expected vs. actual hit rates.
- **Information Aggregation** - Why needed: Critical for combining multiple evidence sources into coherent forecasts. Quick check: Test performance with increasing numbers of supporting documents.
- **Event Resolution Dynamics** - Why needed: Understanding how forecast quality changes as events approach resolution. Quick check: Analyze performance curves at different temporal distances from resolution.
- **Modular Decomposition** - Why needed: Isolates bottlenecks in the forecasting pipeline for targeted improvement. Quick check: Compare end-to-end performance with modular stage-by-stage analysis.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Event Extraction -> Context Construction -> Probabilistic Prediction
**Critical Path:** Market Event Retrieval → Document Retrieval → Evidence Synthesis → Probability Generation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Modular decomposition enables targeted analysis but may lose emergent behaviors from integrated reasoning; live benchmark provides realism but introduces temporal dependencies and market biases
**Failure Signatures:** Event recall failures show up as missing relevant outcomes; context construction failures manifest as incomplete or biased evidence; prediction failures appear as miscalibration or poor short-term accuracy
**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare modular vs. end-to-end forecasting performance to assess information loss
2. Test different information retrieval strategies (keyword vs. semantic search) for context construction
3. Evaluate temporal performance curves to identify resolution-time degradation patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the generalization of LLM forecasting capabilities to multilingual contexts, the impact of market biases on ground truth validity, and the potential for emergent behaviors in integrated versus modular forecasting systems. Additional questions concern the optimal balance between automated reasoning and human-in-the-loop approaches for critical forecasting applications.

## Limitations
- Prediction market outcomes may not always reflect ground truth reality, introducing potential biases
- Focus on English-language events limits generalizability to multilingual forecasting contexts
- Modular decomposition may miss emergent behaviors that arise from integrated forecasting processes
- Performance degradation near event resolution requires deeper analysis of model decision boundaries

## Confidence
- **High:** Brier score comparisons between LLMs and prediction markets (1,300+ resolved events, clear metrics)
- **Medium:** Identification of bottlenecks in event recall and source usage (derived from error analysis, may not capture all failure modes)
- **Medium:** Economic value claims comparing market returns (depend on specific market conditions and trading assumptions)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-validation using alternative ground truth sources (official records, multiple market sources) to verify robustness of performance comparisons
2. Implement controlled experiments testing LLM performance on events with varying temporal distances from resolution, systematically varying information availability
3. Develop and test an integrated end-to-end forecasting pipeline that combines modular stages, comparing performance with decomposed approach
