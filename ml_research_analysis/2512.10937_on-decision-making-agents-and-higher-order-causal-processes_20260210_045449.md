# On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes

- Primary result: Mathematical correspondence between agent-state policies in POMDPs and process functions, enabling quantum-like computational advantages in classical multi-agent settings

## Executive Summary
This work establishes a mathematical bridge between classical decision-making agents and higher-order quantum operations by showing that deterministic agent-state policies in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) correspond exactly to process functions in the classical-deterministic limit of higher-order quantum operations. The key insight is that agent-state policies, when properly formalized through equivalence classes, can be mapped to process functions via a fixed-point criterion. This correspondence enables the translation of multi-agent policy evaluation into higher-order function evaluation, revealing that observation-independent decentralized POMDPs naturally model multi-input process functions.

The work demonstrates a strict separation between definite and indefinite causal structures in multi-agent settings through the majority-GYNI game example, showing that certain POMDPs can achieve strictly higher finite-horizon rewards with indefinite causal structures than with definite causal orders. This result suggests that quantum-like computational advantages can emerge in classical multi-agent decision-making systems when the causal structure is left unspecified.

## Method Summary
The core method involves defining equivalence classes of agent-state policies and establishing a bijection with process functions through a fixed-point criterion. The approach begins by formalizing agent-state policies in POMDPs, then constructs equivalence classes that capture the essential decision-making behavior while abstracting away implementation details. These equivalence classes are shown to correspond one-to-one with process functions through a mathematical proof involving fixed-point theorems. The method then leverages this correspondence to translate multi-agent policy evaluation problems into higher-order function evaluation problems, enabling the analysis of indefinite causal structures in classical decision-making settings.

## Key Results
- Agent-state policies in POMDPs are in bijection with process functions via a fixed-point criterion
- Observation-independent decentralized POMDPs naturally model multi-input process functions
- Strict separation theorem demonstrates quantum-like advantages in classical multi-agent settings using the majority-GYNI game

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The correspondence works because both agent-state policies and process functions share fundamental mathematical properties related to state transitions and information flow. Agent-state policies determine how an agent updates its internal state based on observations and chooses actions, while process functions describe how quantum operations transform input states. The fixed-point criterion ensures that the mapping preserves the essential causal structure of the decision-making process. This mathematical alignment allows translating between the two domains, revealing that multi-agent systems with unspecified causal orders can achieve computational advantages similar to those found in quantum computing.

## Foundational Learning

**Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**: Why needed - Provide the framework for modeling agents that make decisions based on incomplete information about their environment. Quick check - Verify understanding by identifying the state space, observation space, and action space in a simple grid-world example.

**Process Functions**: Why needed - Represent higher-order quantum operations that transform quantum states, providing the mathematical structure for indefinite causal orders. Quick check - Confirm understanding by computing the output of a simple process function on a qubit state.

**Fixed-Point Criterion**: Why needed - Establishes the mathematical condition that enables the bijection between agent-state policies and process functions. Quick check - Test understanding by verifying whether a given policy satisfies the fixed-point condition.

**Equivalence Classes**: Why needed - Allow abstraction of agent-state policies to their essential decision-making behavior while preserving mathematical properties. Quick check - Demonstrate understanding by constructing equivalence classes for simple policies with different internal implementations.

**Indefinite Causal Structures**: Why needed - Enable quantum-like computational advantages by allowing multiple possible causal orders rather than a fixed one. Quick check - Verify understanding by comparing the computational power of definite vs. indefinite causal structures in a simple multi-agent scenario.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Agent-state policies -> Equivalence classes -> Process functions -> Higher-order function evaluation -> Multi-agent POMDP evaluation

**Critical Path**: The critical path runs from defining agent-state policies through constructing equivalence classes to establishing the bijection with process functions, as this mathematical foundation enables all downstream applications including the separation theorem.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff involves the level of abstraction in the equivalence class construction - more abstract classes provide cleaner mathematical properties but may lose some behavioral nuances, while less abstract classes preserve more detail but complicate the mathematical correspondence.

**Failure Signatures**: Failure to establish the bijection typically manifests as either the fixed-point criterion not being satisfied for certain policies, or the equivalence classes failing to preserve essential decision-making properties during the mapping.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify the fixed-point criterion on simple two-state agent policies with binary actions
2. Test the equivalence class construction on policies with identical behavior but different internal implementations
3. Apply the policy-process function mapping to a small multi-agent POMDP and verify computational advantages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- The mathematical mapping relies on specific technical assumptions about POMDP structure that may not generalize
- Quantum advantage claims depend heavily on the exact formulation of the majority-GYNI game instance
- The equivalence class construction may not capture all relevant agent behaviors in more complex scenarios

## Confidence
- **High**: Basic multi-agent POMDP modeling framework and general correspondence concept
- **Medium**: Policy-process function correspondence and equivalence class construction
- **Low-Medium**: Quantum advantage claims and separation theorem due to dependence on specific game parameters

## Next Checks
1. Verify the fixed-point criterion implementation on additional agent-state policy examples beyond the ones presented
2. Test the separation theorem claims with modified versions of the majority-GYNI game parameters
3. Evaluate the policy-process function mapping on agent-state policies with more than two actions per state
