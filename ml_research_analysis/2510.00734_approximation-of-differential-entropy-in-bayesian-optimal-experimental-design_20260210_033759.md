core_contribution: This paper addresses the computational challenge of approximating
  differential entropy in Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED), particularly
  for large-scale inverse problems where likelihood evaluations are expensive. The
  key insight is that when the differential entropy of the likelihood is independent
  of the design or can be evaluated explicitly, the problem reduces to maximum entropy
  estimation, which significantly simplifies the computation.

# Approximation of differential entropy in Bayesian optimal experimental design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00734
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00734
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Reduces Bayesian OED to maximum entropy estimation when likelihood differential entropy is design-independent

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a computationally efficient approach to approximating differential entropy in Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) for large-scale inverse problems. The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) surrogate for the evidence density by pushing prior samples through an approximate forward operator, then estimates the differential entropy using Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The approach avoids nested integration and relies only on mild smoothness assumptions of the forward map, making it particularly suitable for problems where likelihood evaluations are expensive.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages the observation that when differential entropy of the likelihood is independent of design or explicitly evaluable, the Bayesian OED problem reduces to maximum entropy estimation. A GMM surrogate evidence density is constructed by pushing prior samples or quadrature nodes through an approximate forward operator. The differential entropy of this surrogate is then estimated using MC or QMC methods. This approach avoids nested integration and relies only on mild smoothness assumptions of the forward map, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees.

## Key Results
- Theoretical convergence rates proven: O(δ_K + N^{-1/2} + M^{-1/2}) for MC-based GMM, improving to O(δ_K + M^{-1} + N^{-1/2}) with QMC
- Numerical experiments show comparable or better convergence rates than state-of-the-art methods
- Method requires fewer technical assumptions than existing approaches
- Validated on both linear deconvolution and nonlinear elliptic PDE problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method exploits the decomposition of expected information gain into design-dependent and design-independent components. When the design-independent component (differential entropy of likelihood) can be computed or is constant across designs, the optimization reduces to maximizing the differential entropy of the evidence density. The GMM surrogate provides a flexible yet computationally tractable approximation that can be efficiently sampled for entropy estimation. The QMC-based cubature construction further accelerates convergence by providing more uniform coverage of the parameter space compared to random sampling.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Prior samples -> Approximate forward operator -> GMM surrogate -> Entropy estimation -> OED optimization

Critical path: The method's success depends on accurate forward operator approximation and effective GMM construction. The quality of the entropy estimate directly impacts OED performance, making the surrogate construction and estimation steps critical.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades potential approximation error in the GMM surrogate against computational efficiency gains from avoiding nested integration. Using QMC instead of MC improves convergence rates but may require more sophisticated implementation.

Failure signatures: Poor forward operator approximation leads to inaccurate GMM surrogates and unreliable entropy estimates. High-dimensional parameter spaces may require excessive samples for adequate GMM representation. Non-smooth forward operators violate the smoothness assumptions underlying convergence guarantees.

Three first experiments:
1. Verify that GMM surrogate accurately approximates evidence density for a simple linear problem
2. Compare MC vs QMC-based entropy estimates for convergence rates
3. Test sensitivity to forward operator approximation quality by varying δ_K

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes likelihood differential entropy is design-independent or explicitly evaluable, limiting applicability
- GMM surrogate construction sensitive to forward operator approximation quality
- Theoretical convergence analysis relies on bounded second moments and smoothness assumptions that may not hold for ill-posed problems

## Confidence
- High confidence: Theoretical convergence rates for MC and QMC-based estimators
- Medium confidence: Numerical validation results on test problems
- Medium confidence: Claims about computational efficiency relative to state-of-the-art methods

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on problems where the likelihood's differential entropy depends strongly on design parameters
2. Evaluate performance on high-dimensional parameter spaces (d > 100) to assess scalability
3. Compare against alternative entropy estimation methods on problems with non-smooth forward operators
