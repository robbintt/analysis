core_contribution: This research introduces three new datasets to advance idiom and
  figurative language detection in NLP. The PIFL-OSCAR dataset contains 5.8 million
  entries of potential idiomatic expressions, while IFL-OSCAR-A and IFL-C4-A provide
  1,300 human-annotated examples for training and evaluation.

# NLP Datasets for Idiom and Figurative Language Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.16345
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16345
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduced three new datasets for idiom and figurative language detection, achieving 91.51% sequence accuracy on MAGPIE with BERT-based models

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the critical gap in NLP datasets for idiom and figurative language detection by introducing three new resources: PIFL-OSCAR (5.8M entries), IFL-OSCAR-A (1,300 examples), and IFL-C4-A (1,300 examples). The datasets were constructed using Common Crawl data, post-processed with POS tags, BIO labels, and BERT-based similarity metrics, then refined through human annotation. The work demonstrates that specialized models significantly outperform general LLMs like Gemma-3 and Llama3.1 on figurative language tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 91.51% sequence accuracy on the MAGPIE dataset.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a pipeline to create large-scale idiom detection datasets by retrieving context sequences from Common Crawl, applying POS tagging and BIO labeling, and using BERT-based similarity metrics to identify potential idiomatic expressions. The PIFL-OSCAR dataset contains 5.8 million entries, while IFL-OSCAR-A and IFL-C4-A provide 1,300 human-annotated examples each for training and evaluation. Human annotation refined the datasets through careful selection and verification processes. The methodology emphasizes scalability while maintaining quality through systematic post-processing and validation steps.

## Key Results
- BERT-based models achieved state-of-the-art 91.51% sequence accuracy on MAGPIE dataset
- PIFL-OSCAR demonstrated superior generalizability in cross-evaluation with IFL-C4-A
- Chat-based LLMs (Gemma-3, Llama3.1) performed poorly compared to specialized models, highlighting the need for task-specific architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach succeeds by leveraging large-scale web data from Common Crawl, which provides diverse linguistic contexts for idiom detection. The combination of automated filtering with BERT-based similarity metrics and human annotation ensures both scalability and accuracy. The BIO labeling framework effectively captures the span-based nature of idiomatic expressions, while the cross-dataset evaluation validates the generalizability of the PIFL-OSCAR dataset across different contexts.

## Foundational Learning

**Common Crawl data processing**: Why needed - Provides large-scale, diverse web text for training; Quick check - Verify data quality and representativeness across domains

**BERT-based similarity metrics**: Why needed - Enables automated identification of idiomatic expressions; Quick check - Validate similarity scores against human judgments

**BIO labeling framework**: Why needed - Captures span-based nature of idioms in sequence labeling; Quick check - Ensure consistent annotation across examples

**Human annotation refinement**: Why needed - Maintains quality control in large-scale datasets; Quick check - Measure inter-annotator agreement rates

**Cross-dataset evaluation**: Why needed - Validates generalizability beyond single dataset; Quick check - Compare performance across different test sets

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Common Crawl data -> Preprocessing (POS tagging, BIO labeling) -> BERT-based filtering -> Human annotation -> Final datasets (PIFL-OSCAR, IFL-OSCAR-A, IFL-C4-A)

**Critical path**: Data retrieval → Automated filtering → Human refinement → Model training → Evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: Large-scale automated processing vs. human quality control; Generic web data vs. domain-specific curated examples

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on rare idioms; Overfitting to specific linguistic patterns; Bias toward commonly used expressions

**First experiments**:
1. Baseline BERT model training on IFL-OSCAR-A
2. Cross-evaluation between PIFL-OSCAR and IFL-C4-A
3. LLM comparison (Gemma-3, Llama3.1) vs. specialized models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Reliance on Common Crawl data may introduce domain-specific biases and quality inconsistencies
- Human annotation limited to 1,300 examples, potentially constraining diversity representation
- Evaluation focused on single benchmark (MAGPIE) and small cross-validation set
- Poor LLM performance may reflect fine-tuning limitations rather than fundamental model deficiencies

## Confidence

- **High** for dataset construction methodology
- **Medium** for dataset utility claims
- **Low** for generalizability assertions across diverse linguistic contexts
- **Medium** for superiority of specialized models over LLMs

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test datasets and models across multiple languages and cultural contexts to assess true generalizability beyond English-centric data sources

2. **Long-term performance monitoring**: Evaluate model performance degradation over time when applied to evolving language patterns and emerging idiomatic expressions not present in training data

3. **Multi-task evaluation framework**: Assess how well these datasets improve downstream tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and dialogue systems that require figurative language understanding
