## Executive Summary
This paper presents HAFT, a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for automated feature transformation. The framework addresses two key challenges in existing reinforcement learning-based methods: the dynamic expansion of the feature space during iterative learning, which increases learning complexity, and insufficient cooperation among multiple agents, leading to suboptimal feature transformations. HAFT introduces three specialized agents working collaboratively through a shared critic mechanism to improve feature selection and operation selection processes.

## Method Summary
HAFT employs a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning architecture with three specialized agents: two feature agents for selecting which features to transform, and one operation agent for selecting the transformation operation. The framework uses multi-head attention mechanisms to handle the dynamically expanding feature space and state encoding techniques to stabilize the learning process. The agents share a critic mechanism that facilitates cooperation and communication, enabling them to work together to select optimal feature transformation strategies. The system iteratively transforms features to improve downstream model performance on classification and regression tasks.

## Key Results
- HAFT outperforms eight baseline methods across 23 real-world datasets
- Significant improvements in performance metrics: F1 score, 1-RAE, MAE, MSE, and R2
- Strong robustness to different downstream machine learning models
- Better scalability compared to existing automated feature engineering approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The heterogeneous multi-agent architecture enables specialized agents to focus on different aspects of feature transformation while maintaining coordination through a shared critic. The multi-head attention mechanism allows feature agents to effectively process the dynamically expanding feature space by learning which features are most relevant for transformation at each step. The shared critic provides a common reward signal that encourages cooperation among agents, preventing the suboptimal transformations that can occur when agents work independently. State encoding techniques stabilize the learning process by providing consistent representations as the feature space evolves.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-head Attention**: Allows agents to focus on different aspects of the feature space simultaneously; needed for handling complex feature relationships; quick check: verify attention weights correspond to feature importance
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**: Enables distributed decision-making for feature selection and transformation; needed for scalability and specialization; quick check: ensure agents' policies converge to stable strategies
- **State Encoding**: Provides consistent representations as feature space evolves; needed for stable learning; quick check: verify encoding captures relevant state information
- **Shared Critic Mechanism**: Coordinates agent behavior through common reward signal; needed for cooperation; quick check: monitor critic's ability to distinguish good vs bad transformations
- **Feature Space Expansion**: Handles dynamically growing feature sets during iterative transformation; needed for progressive feature engineering; quick check: track feature space growth rate
- **Automated Feature Engineering**: Systematically transforms raw features into higher-quality representations; needed for improved model performance; quick check: compare transformed vs original feature quality

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Raw Features -> Feature Agents (Selection) -> Operation Agent (Transformation) -> Transformed Features -> Downstream Model -> Performance Metric -> Shared Critic

Critical Path: Feature Selection → Operation Selection → Transformation → Evaluation → Reward Signal → Agent Update

Design Tradeoffs:
- Specialization vs coordination: three specialized agents improve efficiency but require careful coordination through shared critic
- Attention complexity vs performance: multi-head attention handles complex feature relationships but increases computational cost
- Exploration vs exploitation: agents must balance trying new transformations with exploiting known good ones

Failure Signatures:
- Agent policy collapse: agents converge to suboptimal strategies; check reward signals and exploration parameters
- Attention divergence: attention weights become unstable; monitor attention distributions over training
- Feature explosion: uncontrolled feature space growth; implement feature pruning or capping mechanisms
- Critic instability: shared critic fails to provide consistent guidance; verify critic network architecture and training

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test single-agent baseline to establish performance floor and validate shared critic necessity
2. Evaluate attention mechanism with synthetic feature spaces to verify proper feature selection
3. Compare convergence rates with and without state encoding to validate stabilization benefits
