## Executive Summary
SearchGym addresses the challenge of training search agents for real-world web navigation by creating a cost-effective synthetic environment. The system generates a knowledge graph of fictional entities, synthesizes a corresponding document corpus, and filters edges by retrievability to ensure clean reward signals during reinforcement learning. Through curriculum learning over reasoning depth and a dual-action space separating search from document access, the method trains agents that generalize to real web APIs with minimal fine-tuning. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on GAIA and xBench benchmarks while reducing training costs compared to real-world simulation.

## Method Summary
SearchGym creates a simulated environment where agents learn to navigate through knowledge graphs using search and document access actions. The method generates synthetic entities and documents, then verifies edge retrievability by testing if target documents appear in top-K results for multiple search queries. Agents are trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a two-stage curriculum: first on simple 1-6 hop questions, then on complex 6-12 hop tasks requiring decomposition and synthesis. The dual-action space forces deliberate document selection, and a minimal alignment phase bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world distributions before deployment.

## Key Results
- Achieves 52.09% GAIA score, representing 12.57% improvement over previous state-of-the-art
- Reduces training costs by 50% compared to prior real-world simulation approaches
- Demonstrates successful sim-to-real transfer with minimal 200-step alignment on Wikipedia data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Verified Edge Retrievability Eliminates Corrupted Reward Signals
Filtering knowledge graph edges by retrievability ensures every reasoning path yields clean reward signals during RL training. For each edge, 15 search queries are generated and executed against the corpus; the edge is retained only if the target document appears in top-K results for ≥5 queries. This guarantees any valid reasoning path is discoverable via search, decoupling the agent's reasoning capability from stochastic retrieval failures.

### Mechanism 2: Curriculum Learning Over Reasoning Depth Enables Stable Policy Convergence
Two-stage curriculum prevents policy collapse by establishing foundational skills before introducing long-horizon tasks. Stage 1 trains on Simple QA (1-6 hops) to master query formulation and sequential evidence gathering. Stage 2 introduces Parallel/Combo QA with 6-12 hop chains requiring decomposition and synthesis. Progressive difficulty prevents sparse-reward destabilization.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Primitive Action Space Enforces Deliberate Document Selection
Separating Search(q) from Access(u) forces agents to evaluate snippet relevance before committing to full document reading, improving reasoning discipline. Search returns snippets with URLs; Access retrieves full content. The agent must actively judge which sources merit deeper investigation, creating a higher-reasoning-demand environment.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed: The paper uses GRPO for policy optimization, which normalizes rewards across trajectory groups rather than using absolute rewards.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why standardizing rewards within a group of N trajectories helps stabilize training compared to using raw terminal rewards?

- **Concept: Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Reasoning**
  - Why needed: Understanding how paths like (Person → University → City → Country → Language) translate to executable search sequences is essential.
  - Quick check: Given a 4-hop path from entity A to answer E, what search queries would an agent need to execute sequentially?

- **Concept: Sim-to-Real Transfer**
  - Why needed: The core claim is that synthetic training generalizes to real web APIs; understanding domain shift is critical.
  - Quick check: What distributional differences might exist between fictional entity documents and real Wikipedia pages that could harm transfer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Schema-driven KG generator (defines entity types, attributes, cardinalities)
  2. LLM-based corpus synthesizer (M_gen generates Wikipedia-style documents)
  3. Meilisearch retrieval backend (indexes corpus, returns top-K results)
  4. Edge verification module (filters KG by retrievability)
  5. QA synthesis pipeline (verbalizes paths into Simple/Parallel/Combo questions)
  6. GRPO training loop (samples trajectories, computes F1 rewards, updates policy)
  7. Two-stage curriculum controller (manages task difficulty progression)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define schema → Generate KG nodes/edges → Synthesize documents
  2. Verify edge retrievability → Filter to verified subgraph G*
  3. Sample paths from G* → Verbalize into QA pairs → Stratify by complexity
  4. Stage 1 training on Simple QA (1-6 hops) → Stage 2 on Parallel/Combo (6-12 hops)
  5. Minimal alignment phase (200 steps on Wikipedia) → Deploy to real web API

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Synthetic entities eliminate parametric memory shortcuts but require $50 generation cost and may lack real-world linguistic diversity
  - Edge filtering guarantees solvability but may over-prune interesting edge cases
  - Dual action space increases reasoning demand but adds inference latency

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Training curve shows volatility or collapse → Check for reward signal corruption from unverified paths
  - Agent retrieves but never accesses documents → Snippets may be too informative; reduce snippet length
  - Strong SearchGymBench performance but poor real-world transfer → Alignment phase may be insufficient

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate edge verification: Sample 100 filtered edges, manually confirm target documents are retrievable within 5 queries
  2. Ablate curriculum: Train without Stage 2 and compare training stability curves against full method
  3. Test action space: Run Search-only baseline and measure performance gap on multi-hop tasks to quantify Access action contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the "Minimal Alignment Phase" (using real-world Wikipedia data) a strict requirement for Sim-to-Real generalization, or can the synthetic environment be modified to render this transfer step unnecessary?
- Basis in paper: Appendix C.6 states a "Minimal Alignment Phase" using 200 steps of real-world data is used to "bridge the distributional gap" between the synthetic corpus and standard Wikipedia.
- Why unresolved: The paper attributes success to the synthetic environment, but the inclusion of this alignment phase suggests the synthetic data alone may be insufficient for seamless transfer to real-world tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study training agents *exclusively* on the SearchGym corpus without the Minimal Alignment Phase, evaluated on the full suite of real-world benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does training on a simplified action space of `Search` and `Access` limit an agent's ability to generalize to complex browser interactions (e.g., form filling, tab management, scrolling) required in real-world web navigation?
- Basis in paper: Section 3.2 defines the action space specifically to "mimic web browsing" but restricts it to two primitives, abstracting away the complexities of DOM interaction and state management present in full browser automation.
- Why unresolved: The benchmarks used (QA datasets) primarily test information retrieval rather than complex UI navigation, leaving the agent's capability for broader web interaction untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of SearchGym-trained agents on benchmarks requiring full browser automation (e.g., WebShop or VisualWebArena) rather than just text-based search APIs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the agent's search strategy when exposed to retrieval engines with significantly different ranking algorithms or noise profiles than the Meilisearch engine used during training?
- Basis in paper: Appendix C.2 details the specific use of Meilisearch for its "typo tolerance and relevance ranking algorithms," implying the agent learns heuristics that may be tied to this specific retrieval behavior.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows generalization to Google Search (Live Web), the sensitivity of the agent's query reformulation strategy to the underlying retrieval index characteristics remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the agent's performance across diverse local retrieval indices (e.g., sparse BM25 vs. dense E5 vs. Meilisearch) without re-training to isolate the dependence on the retrieval engine's characteristics.

## Limitations
- Edge verification thresholds may not generalize across different search engines or document distributions
- Synthetic entity distributions may inadequately represent real-world search complexity and linguistic diversity
- Minimal 200-step Wikipedia alignment provides weak evidence for broad real-world generalization

## Confidence
- Synthetic environment validity for RL training: Medium - Internal consistency shown but real-world representation uncertain
- Sim-to-real transfer capability: Low - Minimal alignment phase suggests synthetic data alone may be insufficient
- Performance improvements over baselines: High - GAIA and xBench evaluations provide concrete evidence

## Next Checks
1. Cross-engine retrieval validation: Sample 100 verified edges and test their retrievability across three different search engines to assess engine-agnostic verification thresholds.
2. Real-world task complexity transfer: Deploy trained agent on 50 manually curated real-world multi-hop questions spanning different domains and measure performance degradation compared to synthetic benchmarks.
3. Temporal robustness test: Re-run edge verification process after 3 months using same corpus but with updated search algorithms to quantify sensitivity to retrieval engine changes.
