# Designing Ambiguity Sets for Distributionally Robust Optimization Using Structural Causal Optimal Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00599
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00599
- Reference count: 32
- The paper proposes using structural causal models to design more realistic ambiguity sets in distributionally robust optimization by incorporating both causal graphs and structural equations.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) by proposing a method to construct ambiguity sets that capture both the causal structure and the magnitude of relationships between variables. Traditional DRO approaches either ignore causal structure entirely or only use the causal graph without incorporating the strength of causal relationships. The authors introduce structural causal optimal transport, which leverages information from structural causal models to create more realistic uncertainty sets. This approach results in ambiguity sets that better reflect the true causal relationships in the data, leading to more reliable worst-case performance guarantees.

The key innovation is a relaxed version of structural causal OT that replaces complex causal constraints with a regularization term, enabling efficient computation through a difference-of-convex programming approach combined with Sinkhorn's method. The paper demonstrates that this method overcomes the curse of dimensionality typically associated with optimal transport problems, achieving faster convergence rates independent of feature space dimension. Experimental results validate that the proposed structural causal ambiguity set provides superior worst-case loss bounds compared to previous methods, particularly in scenarios where understanding the magnitude of relationships between variables is crucial.

## Method Summary
The method introduces structural causal optimal transport (OT) as a framework for designing ambiguity sets in DRO. The approach uses both the causal graph and structural equations from SCMs to define a transportation cost that captures causal relationships. A relaxed version replaces complex causal constraints with a regularization term, enabling efficient optimization through difference-of-convex programming combined with Sinkhorn's method. The framework also provides finite sample guarantees when structural equations must be estimated from data, and demonstrates improved convergence rates that are independent of feature space dimension.

## Key Results
- Proposed structural causal optimal transport framework uses both causal graphs and structural equations to create more realistic ambiguity sets
- Relaxed formulation with regularization enables efficient computation via difference-of-convex programming and Sinkhorn's method
- Method overcomes curse of dimensionality with convergence rates independent of feature space dimension
- Experimental results show improved worst-case loss bounds compared to previous methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by incorporating the full information from structural causal models - not just the causal graph structure but also the magnitude of relationships encoded in structural equations. This additional information allows the ambiguity set to better reflect realistic perturbations of the underlying distribution. The relaxation technique transforms the problem into a tractable optimization that can be solved efficiently while still maintaining the core benefits of causal structure awareness.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
SCM Information -> Structural Causal OT Formulation -> Relaxation with Regularization -> Difference-of-Convex + Sinkhorn Optimization -> Ambiguity Set Construction

**Critical Path:**
1. Obtain or estimate structural causal model
2. Formulate structural causal optimal transport problem
3. Apply relaxation to make problem tractable
4. Solve using difference-of-convex programming with Sinkhorn iterations
5. Use resulting ambiguity set in DRO framework

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational efficiency vs. faithfulness to causal constraints
- Regularization strength vs. relaxation quality
- Sample complexity of structural equation estimation vs. accuracy of ambiguity set

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor worst-case performance if structural equations are misspecified
- Computational intractability if regularization is too weak
- Over-conservative ambiguity sets if regularization is too strong

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Synthetic example with known causal structure to verify method correctness
2. Comparison on benchmark datasets against graph-only ambiguity sets
3. Sensitivity analysis to estimation errors in structural equations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on accurate knowledge or estimation of structural equations, which may be unavailable or misspecified
- Computational scalability concerns in very high-dimensional settings despite theoretical improvements
- Limited empirical evaluation scope, with unclear generalizability across diverse problem domains

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters confidence:**
- The theoretical framework of structural causal OT (High confidence)
- The relaxed formulation's effectiveness (Medium confidence)
- The method's ability to overcome dimensionality issues (Medium confidence)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of errors in estimated structural equations on the resulting ambiguity sets and worst-case performance guarantees.
2. Test the computational scalability on benchmark datasets with increasing dimensionality and compare against state-of-the-art DRO methods in terms of both solution quality and runtime.
3. Apply the method to real-world applications where causal structure is partially known or must be inferred, and evaluate the robustness of results to different levels of causal uncertainty.
