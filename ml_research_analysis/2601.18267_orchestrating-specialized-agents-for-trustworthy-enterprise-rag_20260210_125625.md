core_contribution: ADORE addresses enterprise RAG limitations by introducing an agentic,
  iterative workflow that uses a structured Memory Bank to constrain generation, audit
  evidence coverage, and guide targeted retrieval. Unlike linear pipelines, it orchestrates
  specialized agents for clarification, planning, execution, and report synthesis,
  with a self-evolving search and evidence-driven stopping criterion.

- Primary result: ADORE achieved RACE score of 52.65 (rank #1) and 77.21% win rate against competitors on enterprise RAG benchmarks

## Executive Summary
ADORE introduces an agentic, iterative workflow for enterprise RAG that addresses limitations of linear pipelines through specialized multi-agent orchestration. The system uses a structured Memory Bank to constrain generation, audit evidence coverage, and guide targeted retrieval, ensuring traceable, citation-backed reports with systematic completeness checks. On the DeepResearch Bench, ADORE achieved top rankings, demonstrating superior quality and trustworthiness in enterprise knowledge synthesis.

## Method Summary
ADORE employs a hub-and-spoke multi-agent architecture with a central Orchestrator routing to specialized agents (Grounding, Planning, Execution, Report Generation, WebSearch). The system uses a Memory Bank with Claim-Evidence Graph for section-scoped admissible evidence, iterative retrieval-reflection loops with section-level coverage auditing, evidence-driven stopping criteria, and section-packed context with citation-preserving compression. This enables traceable, grounded synthesis under context limits without requiring model training.

## Key Results
- RACE score of 52.65 on DeepResearch Bench, ranking first among evaluated systems
- 77.21% win rate in side-by-side preference judgments against leading competitors on DeepConsult dataset
- Systematic completeness verification through evidence-driven stopping criterion and section-level coverage audits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Constraining report generation to a structured Memory Bank with explicit claim–evidence linkage produces traceable, citation-backed outputs.
- Mechanism: The Memory Bank maintains section-scoped admissible evidence sets. During synthesis, each section is generated using only its corresponding evidence from the Claim–Evidence Graph, enforcing traceability by construction—every claim must map to a citation already stored in the admissible set.
- Core assumption: LLMs will reliably honor the admissible-evidence constraint during generation, and that explicit scoping prevents citation hallucination.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim–Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations"
  - [section]: "each section is written using only the section-scoped evidence stored in the claim–evidence graph. This enables traceability by construction"
  - [corpus]: Related work (Rethinking All Evidence) addresses conflict handling but does not evaluate memory-locked generation; corpus evidence for this mechanism is indirect.
- Break condition: If the Memory Bank contains incomplete or biased evidence, reports remain traceable but potentially misleading. Also breaks if LLM ignores constraints and hallucinates uncited claims.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Section-level evidence coverage audits can identify gaps, trigger targeted retrieval, and provide a principled stopping criterion.
- Mechanism: After each retrieval–reflection cycle, the system audits whether each planned section has sufficient evidence support. Gaps trigger focused follow-up retrieval. Iteration terminates when coverage satisfies plan requirements—not after a fixed number of steps.
- Core assumption: Coverage can be quantified meaningfully at section granularity, and targeted retrieval based on gap signals improves completeness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion"
  - [section]: "When coverage indicates insufficient support, the system triggers targeted follow-up retrieval and focused rewriting for the affected sections"
  - [corpus]: Self-RAG and IRCoT are cited as iterative retrieval baselines; ADORE's section-level coverage criterion is presented as a departure but lacks direct corpus validation.
- Break condition: Poorly calibrated coverage thresholds cause premature termination or excessive iteration. Breaks if reflection fails to detect genuine gaps.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form grounded synthesis tractable under context limits.
- Mechanism: Rather than loading all evidence at once, the system packs only section-relevant evidence per generation call, prunes redundant or low-salience text, and compresses sources into summaries that retain citation anchors—mitigating "lost in the middle" effects.
- Core assumption: Compression preserves citation integrity and essential evidence; section-scoped context suffices for coherent synthesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits"
  - [section]: Cites "Lost in the Middle" literature showing models underuse evidence in long contexts even when present
  - [corpus]: Long-context methods (e.g., Longformer) address token limits but not section-scoped evidence management; corpus support is weak.
- Break condition: Compression that loses nuance or citation anchors degrades traceability. Over-aggressive section-scoping may hurt cross-sectional coherence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hub-and-spoke multi-agent orchestration
  - Why needed here: ADORE uses a central Orchestrator that routes to specialized agents (Grounding, Planning, Execution, Report Generation, WebSearch). Understanding this coordination pattern is essential for debugging and extending the system.
  - Quick check question: Why does the orchestrator route simple factoid queries differently than complex analytical tasks?

- Concept: Retrieval–reflection loops with coverage auditing
  - Why needed here: Evidence-coverage–guided execution relies on auditing retrieved evidence against the outline to identify gaps and decide whether to continue iterating.
  - Quick check question: What signal does ADORE use to decide whether to retrieve more evidence or finalize the report?

- Concept: Claim–Evidence Graphs / Memory Banks
  - Why needed here: The Memory Bank is the central data structure enabling traceability. It maintains explicit claim–evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence sets.
  - Quick check question: How does constraining generation to section-scoped admissible evidence enable citation auditing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Orchestrator Agent -> Grounding Agent -> Planning Agent -> Execution Agent -> Report Generation Agent
  - Orchestrator Agent also routes to WebSearch Agent for retrieval
  - Memory Bank persists throughout workflow

- Critical path:
  1. Orchestrator classifies query complexity → routes to deep-research workflow if complex
  2. Grounding Agent resolves ambiguity → produces refined brief
  3. Planning Agent generates structured plan → user confirms or edits
  4. Report Generation Agent drafts outline
  5. Execution loop: retrieve → reflect on section-level coverage → refine queries → update outline → check stopping criterion
  6. Memory-locked synthesis produces final report with traceable citations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Traceability vs. flexibility: Memory-locked synthesis guarantees grounding but constrains open-ended generation.
  - Iteration depth vs. latency: Evidence-driven stopping can iterate extensively for completeness.
  - Section-scoping vs. cross-section coherence: Per-section packing improves context utilization but may miss cross-cutting insights.

- Failure signatures:
  - Premature termination: Coverage thresholds too lenient → incomplete reports.
  - Infinite or excessive loops: Coverage thresholds too strict or reflection fails to recognize adequacy.
  - Citation drift: Compression loses anchors → untraceable claims.
  - Cold-start misalignment: Grounding Agent fails to clarify ambiguity → misdirected retrieval.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate memory-locking: Allow unconstrained generation and measure citation accuracy and traceability vs. baseline.
  2. Vary coverage thresholds: Test different stopping criteria and plot completeness vs. iteration count.
  3. Stress-test routing: Evaluate orchestrator classification accuracy and downstream quality on curated simple vs. complex queries.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the framework be extended to support prescriptive decision-making by generating actionable options and trade-offs rather than purely descriptive synthesis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work will focus on extending planning to propose decision options and trade-offs, not only synthesis.
- Why unresolved: The current system focuses on report generation and traceability, lacking the capability to analyze or recommend specific actions based on the synthesized evidence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a decision-theoretic module and evaluation of its ability to generate valid, trade-off-aware recommendations in enterprise scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What granular metrics and automated audit mechanisms are required to robustly validate citation accuracy and factual consistency in specialized technical domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies the development of granular citation-accuracy metrics and automatic audits for technical domains as a specific area for future work.
- Why unresolved: While the Memory Bank enforces linkage, the current system relies on general grounding without domain-specific verification of the technical correctness of citations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A suite of automated, domain-specific metrics that demonstrate high correlation with human expert audits of technical report accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does the reported 77.21% preference win rate against competitors align with human expert judgments regarding trustworthiness and traceability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation relies heavily on an "LLM-judge win/tie/lose framework" (Section 3.2), but does not provide human validation for this specific preference metric.
- Why unresolved: LLM-based evaluation may not fully capture the nuances of "trustworthiness" or "traceability" that are critical for enterprise adoption, potentially inflating preference scores.
- What evidence would resolve it: A human-in-the-loop study comparing LLM-judge preferences with blind human expert evaluations on the DeepConsult dataset.

## Limitations
- Memory Bank's ability to maintain citation integrity under aggressive compression remains unverified
- Evidence coverage thresholds and stopping criterion formulas are unspecified
- Orchestrator routing accuracy untested in edge cases of ambiguous query complexity

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Multi-agent orchestration pattern and section-scoped evidence management are well-specified and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Iterative retrieval-reflection loop with coverage auditing appears mechanistically sound but lacks validation of coverage quantification methods
- **Low confidence**: Evidence coverage threshold definitions, citation-preserving compression algorithms, and orchestrator routing decision boundaries remain underspecified

## Next Checks
1. Implement baseline unconstrained generation and measure citation hallucination rates vs. ADORE's memory-locked approach. Track how compression affects citation coverage across section scopes.
2. Systematically vary evidence coverage thresholds and plot completeness metrics against iteration count. Identify optimal stopping points and test premature termination vs. over-iteration behaviors.
3. Construct curated test sets of ambiguous queries spanning simple factoid to complex analytical tasks. Measure orchestrator routing accuracy and downstream quality degradation when misclassified.
