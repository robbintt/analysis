# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Design in Photonic Integrated Circuits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.18627
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18627
- **Reference count:** 22
- **Primary result:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for inverse design of photonic integrated circuits using Bandit Actor-Critic and Bandit Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), addressing the limitation of gradient-based optimization in avoiding local minima. The approach discretizes the design space into a grid, formulating it as an optimization problem with thousands of binary variables. Two MARL algorithms—Bandit Actor-Critic (BAC) and Bandit Proximal Policy Optimization (BPPO)—are developed to optimize designs using only a few thousand electromagnetic simulation samples. Experiments across two- and three-dimensional design tasks (silicon and polymer PICs) demonstrate that BAC and BPPO outperform gradient-based optimization and evolutionary algorithms, achieving superior performance in both transmission efficiency and robustness. The work provides a benchmark for sample-efficient RL in photonics and highlights the potential of MARL for complex inverse design problems. The framework and algorithms are made open-source to facilitate further research.

## Method Summary
The paper formulates PIC inverse design as a binary optimization problem on a discretized grid, where each grid point can be either silicon (1) or air (0). The authors develop two multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms: Bandit Actor-Critic (BAC) and Bandit Proximal Policy Optimization (BPPO). These algorithms operate by treating each grid cell as an agent that can be in one of two states (silicon or air). The agents learn through interaction with an electromagnetic simulation environment, receiving rewards based on transmission efficiency. The key innovation is the use of bandit-based policy updates that enable sample-efficient learning without requiring gradient information about the electromagnetic simulations.

## Key Results
- BAC and BPPO algorithms outperform gradient-based optimization and evolutionary algorithms in transmission efficiency
- The framework achieves sample efficiency with only a few thousand electromagnetic simulation samples
- Demonstrates superior performance in both two-dimensional silicon and three-dimensional polymer PIC designs
- Shows improved robustness to manufacturing variations compared to traditional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming the continuous inverse design problem into a discrete binary optimization task that can be solved using reinforcement learning. By discretizing the design space into a grid, the problem becomes amenable to MARL algorithms where each grid cell acts as an independent agent. The bandit-based policy updates allow the agents to learn efficiently without requiring gradient information from the expensive electromagnetic simulations. This sample-efficient approach is particularly valuable in photonics where each simulation can be computationally expensive. The multi-agent formulation naturally captures the interactions between different parts of the design, allowing the algorithm to discover globally optimal solutions that avoid local minima traps common in gradient-based methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Grid cells (agents) -> Electromagnetic simulation environment -> Reward function -> Policy network -> Action selection -> Environment update

**Critical Path**: Policy update -> Action selection -> Simulation evaluation -> Reward computation -> Policy improvement

**Design Tradeoffs**: Discretization granularity vs. computational complexity, sample efficiency vs. solution accuracy, agent independence vs. coordination complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Getting stuck in local optima, poor sample efficiency, unstable learning curves, failure to converge to feasible solutions

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify single-agent performance on simple 2D structures before scaling to multi-agent
