# Irony Detection in Urdu Text: A Comparative Study Using Machine Learning Models and Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.22356
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22356
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: LLaMA 3 (8B) achieved 94.61% F1-score for irony detection in Urdu, outperforming traditional ML methods

## Executive Summary
This study addresses irony detection in Urdu, a low-resource language, by translating an English ironic corpus and evaluating its performance using both traditional machine learning models and large language models (LLMs). The authors compare ten machine learning algorithms with GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings against fine-tuned transformer models including BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, and Mistral. Among traditional methods, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest F1-score of 89.18%, while LLaMA 3 (8B) outperformed all models with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results demonstrate that integrating transliteration and modern NLP models enables robust irony detection in Urdu, validating the feasibility of cross-lingual adaptation for resource-constrained languages.

## Method Summary
The researchers translated an English ironic corpus into Urdu and evaluated irony detection performance using ten traditional machine learning algorithms with GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings, compared against fine-tuned transformer models including BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, and Mistral. Traditional ML models achieved up to 89.18% F1-score (Gradient Boosting), while LLMs showed superior performance with LLaMA 3 (8B) reaching 94.61% F1-score. The study focused on cross-lingual adaptation of irony detection techniques for the low-resource Urdu language context.

## Key Results
- LLaMA 3 (8B) achieved the highest F1-score of 94.61% for irony detection in Urdu text
- Traditional Gradient Boosting model reached 89.18% F1-score, the best among non-LLM approaches
- Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Mistral) outperformed traditional ML algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that irony detection in Urdu can be effectively achieved through cross-lingual adaptation, where models trained on translated English data can identify ironic patterns in Urdu text. The superior performance of LLMs suggests they can capture complex contextual and semantic relationships necessary for irony detection better than traditional word embedding approaches. The transliteration component enables the use of existing NLP resources for a low-resource language, while the fine-tuning process allows models to adapt to the specific linguistic patterns of Urdu irony.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-lingual adaptation**: Why needed - enables application of models trained on high-resource languages to low-resource languages like Urdu; Quick check - compare performance on translated vs native Urdu corpora
- **Transliteration in NLP**: Why needed - bridges resource gaps for languages with limited digital text; Quick check - measure performance degradation when removing transliteration step
- **Irony detection mechanisms**: Why needed - irony relies on contextual and semantic incongruities that require sophisticated pattern recognition; Quick check - analyze error patterns for different irony types

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data Translation -> Preprocessing -> Embedding Generation -> Model Training -> Evaluation

**Critical path**: Translated corpus → Tokenization → Embedding (GloVe/Word2Vec or transformer) → Classification → F1-score calculation

**Design tradeoffs**: Traditional ML offers faster training but lower accuracy; LLMs provide higher accuracy but require more computational resources and fine-tuning data

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on code-mixed text, inability to detect cultural-specific irony, degradation when transliteration quality decreases

**First experiments**:
1. Benchmark traditional ML models (Gradient Boosting, SVM, Random Forest) with different embeddings
2. Fine-tune transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) on translated Urdu corpus
3. Compare LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, and Mistral performance with varying parameter sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on translated English data rather than natively collected Urdu ironic text
- Limited discussion of transliteration effects on model performance
- Absence of explicit comparison between translated and native corpora
- Lack of detailed error analysis for specific irony types

## Confidence
- Translation quality affects model generalizability: Medium
- LLMs outperform traditional methods in Urdu irony detection: High
- Results applicable to real-world Urdu communication: Medium
- Cross-lingual adaptation sufficient for low-resource languages: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Collect and annotate a natively written Urdu ironic corpus to compare performance against the translated dataset
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of transliteration versus native Urdu script on model accuracy
3. Perform detailed error analysis to identify specific types of irony (verbal, situational, dramatic) that models struggle to detect, particularly in code-mixed or dialectal Urdu text
