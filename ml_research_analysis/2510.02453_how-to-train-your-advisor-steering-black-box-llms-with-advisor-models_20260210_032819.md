# How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Advisor models improve frontier model performance on specialized tasks (71% accuracy gain on taxes, 24.6% efficiency improvement on software agent tasks)

## Executive Summary
Advisor Models introduce a novel approach for steering frozen black-box LLMs by training a lightweight open-weight model to generate natural language advice that elicits better outputs from the black-box student. This method uses reinforcement learning (GRPO) to train the advisor based on task-specific rewards, without modifying the black-box model itself. The approach enables instance-specific guidance, outperforms static prompt optimization, and demonstrates successful transfer from low-cost to frontier models. Key applications include tax reasoning (71% accuracy gain), software agent efficiency (24.6% improvement), and personalized output generation (85-100% reward vs 40-60% baseline).

## Method Summary
Advisor Models train a lightweight parametric policy (typically a 7B open-weight model) using reinforcement learning to generate natural language advice that steers a frozen black-box student model. The advisor samples advice, the student conditions on this advice to produce outputs, and a task-specific reward is computed from these outputs. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the advisor parameters to increase the probability of high-reward advice. The method supports both 2-step (advice → student) and 3-step (student initial → advice → student final) architectures, with multi-turn variants for agentic tasks. Advisors trained on low-cost models can transfer improvements to frontier models, preserving base capabilities on untrained tasks.

## Key Results
- Tax tasks: 71% accuracy improvement on RuleArena Taxes Level 0
- Software agent efficiency: 24.6% improvement in resolve rate and efficiency on SWE-smith tasks
- Personalization: 85-100% reward vs 40-60% baseline on Review Length domain
- Transfer capability: Advisors trained on GPT-4o mini successfully transfer to Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5
- Resource efficiency: 7B advisors achieve results comparable to much larger models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reinforcement learning on task rewards shapes advisor policy to generate advice that elicits better black-box outputs. The advisor samples natural language advice → black-box model conditions on this advice → environment returns scalar reward → GRPO updates advisor parameters to increase probability of high-reward advice. This transforms prompt engineering from manual search into learned policy optimization. Core assumption: The mapping from advice to reward is sufficiently consistent for the advisor to learn reliable patterns, and the black-box model's in-context learning can reliably act on the advice. Evidence: Section 3 describes GRPO training loop; related work on steering vectors shows prompting-based approaches are more effective than representation-level steering. Break condition: High variance in student responses for identical advice or tasks where black-box models are already near-optimal.

### Mechanism 2
Advisors trained on low-cost models transfer improvements to frontier models because they learn generalizable natural language strategies. The advisor learns task-relevant strategies encoded in natural language (e.g., "use grep instead of ls for efficient file exploration"). Since frontier models share language understanding capabilities, this advice transfers without retraining—transferring the policy, not just outputs. Core assumption: The advice strategies learned are model-agnostic natural language patterns that both low-cost and frontier models can interpret and act upon similarly. Evidence: Section 4.2 shows advisors trained on Gemini 2.5 Flash transfer to Gemini 3 Pro; Appendix D.1 demonstrates cross-provider transfer from GPT-4o mini to Claude 4.5 Sonnet. Break condition: Advice that exploits specific failure modes or quirks of the training student model that don't generalize.

### Mechanism 3
Instance-specific advice outperforms static prompts because it conditions on actual input content and intermediate trajectory observations. Unlike static prompt optimization that finds one fixed prompt for all instances, the advisor policy π(advice | input, observations) generates tailored guidance per-instance. In multi-turn settings, it further conditions on trajectory history, enabling reactive course correction. Core assumption: The optimal advice varies meaningfully across instances and cannot be captured by a single static template; the advisor has sufficient capacity to learn this instance-sensitive mapping. Evidence: Section 4.3.1 shows ADVISOR MODELS achieves 0.94-0.996 reward vs. GEPA/PAG at ~0.4-0.6 on personalization tasks; Section 2 contrasts static prompt optimization with reactive context-specific advice generation. Break condition: Tasks where optimal strategy is uniform across all instances.

## Foundational Learning

- **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Why needed: The paper uses GRPO specifically for advisor training, requiring understanding of how RL can update language model policies using only reward signals without access to student gradients. Quick check: Can you explain why GRPO (or any policy gradient method) can train the advisor without backpropagating through the black-box student model?

- **In-context learning as a control interface**: Why needed: The entire method relies on the black-box model modifying its behavior based on advice injected into its context—understanding the limits and reliability of this conditioning is critical. Quick check: What happens to advisor effectiveness if the student model's in-context following becomes less reliable for longer contexts or unusual instruction formats?

- **Multi-turn RL with delayed rewards**: Why needed: For agentic tasks like SWE Agent Efficiency, the advisor generates multiple pieces of advice across a trajectory, with reward only at the end—credit assignment across advisor turns is non-trivial. Quick check: In a 40-step SWE agent trajectory with advisor intervention every 5 steps, how should reward credit be distributed across the 8 advisor generations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User Input → [Advisor Model] → Advice → [Black-Box Student] → Actions → [Environment] → Observations + Final Reward → [Back to Advisor for GRPO Update]

- Critical path: 1. Define task and reward function, 2. Choose advisor model (7B open-weight recommended) and student model, 3. Design advisor prompt template, 4. Configure GRPO hyperparameters, 5. Train on collected examples (75-200 train examples typical), 6. Transfer to frontier model for evaluation

- Design tradeoffs: 2-step vs 3-step architecture (3-step better for verification tasks like Taxes but doubles student API calls); advisor intervention frequency (more frequent increases control but also cost); training student choice (cheaper model enables transfer but direct frontier training might yield larger gains); strong vs weak initialization (strong prompts accelerate learning but may bias exploration)

- Failure signatures: No improvement despite training (task may be saturated); untrained advisor hurts performance (low-quality advice can mislead); good training performance, poor transfer (advice may be overfit to training student's quirks); resolve rate drops while efficiency improves (reward function must explicitly balance both)

- First 3 experiments: 1. Verify pipeline on simple personalization task (Review Length domain, confirm advisor can reach >0.9 reward), 2. Test transfer within model family (train on GPT-4o mini, evaluate on both GPT-4o mini and GPT-4.1), 3. Ablate initialization strength (run same domain with weak vs strong initialization, compare learning curves)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What factors predict whether an advisor model can successfully transfer across model families, and can transfer effectiveness be estimated a priori? Basis: Appendix D.1 shows cross-family transfer works but with smaller gains than within-family; Section 4.2 notes MTOB transfer to GPT-5 showed "smaller in magnitude" gains. Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates transfer is possible but does not identify characteristics that enable or limit successful transfer. Evidence needed: Systematic study varying model families, capability gaps, and task types with correlation analysis.

### Open Question 2
How does advisor model scale (parameter count) affect steering effectiveness, and is there an optimal advisor-to-student capability ratio? Basis: The paper uses 7-8B advisor models across all experiments without ablation on advisor size; Section 4.4.3 shows a weaker advisor (3B) advising a stronger student (7B) captures "most of the improvement." Why unresolved: No experiments vary advisor model capacity while holding other factors constant. Evidence needed: Controlled experiments with advisor models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters.

### Open Question 3
Can the effectiveness of advisor training be predicted before costly RL training, based on properties of the student model and task distribution? Basis: Section 4.4.4 states "A requirement for ADVISOR MODELS to be effective is that there must be something for the advisor to learn" and MATH-500 experiment shows no improvement when student is already near-optimal. Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem post-hoc but provides no method to detect "maxed-out" scenarios before training. Evidence needed: Development of metrics that correlate with potential advisor improvement, validated across diverse tasks.

## Limitations

- Transfer effectiveness is not fully characterized, particularly for cross-provider transfers (e.g., OpenAI to Anthropic)
- Computational cost scaling ($14-45K per domain) and environmental impact of training advisors remain underexplored
- Method's reliance on consistent reward differentiation for effective RL training suggests potential fragility in domains with high output variance

## Confidence

- **High**: The core RL mechanism (GRPO training of advisor models) is well-established and reproducible
- **Medium**: Transfer claims between models and domains, though empirically supported, need broader validation across different model families and task types
- **Medium**: Efficiency improvements in agentic tasks, as they depend on specific reward function design and may not generalize

## Next Checks

1. **Transfer Robustness Test**: Train advisors on multiple low-cost models (GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Haiku) and systematically evaluate transfer to frontier models across different providers (GPT-4.5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.0) to map transfer boundaries

2. **Variance Analysis**: Measure and report output variance for identical advice across multiple student generations to quantify the reliability of the advisor-student interface and validate the need for Monte Carlo estimation

3. **Task Saturation Boundaries**: Systematically identify task domains where frontier models are already near-optimal (like MATH-500) versus those with headroom for improvement, to establish clear guidance on when Advisor Models will be effective
