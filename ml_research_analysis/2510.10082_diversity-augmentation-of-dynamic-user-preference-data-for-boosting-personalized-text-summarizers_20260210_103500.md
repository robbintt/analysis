# Diversity Augmentation of Dynamic User Preference Data for Boosting Personalized Text Summarizers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.10082
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10082
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** PerAugy achieves 61.2% average improvement in personalization metrics for text summarizers

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PerAugy, a diversity augmentation framework designed to address the scarcity of training data containing both user preference histories and gold-reference summaries for personalized text summarization. The method employs cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation to generate synthetic user trajectories that enrich the training dataset. PerAugy demonstrates significant improvements across four state-of-the-art user encoders, with the best configuration showing a 0.132 increase in AUC. The framework also validates its effectiveness through cross-domain evaluation, particularly showing promise in low-resource domains like OpenAI Reddit.

## Method Summary
PerAugy operates through a two-pronged augmentation strategy: cross-trajectory shuffling combines elements from different user interaction sequences to create novel training examples, while summary-content perturbation modifies existing summaries to generate variations that maintain semantic relevance while increasing diversity. The framework specifically targets the data scarcity problem in personalized summarization where both user preference histories and gold-reference summaries are simultaneously required but rarely available in sufficient quantities. By synthetically expanding these datasets, PerAugy enables better training of user encoders that capture individual preferences for personalized summary generation.

## Key Results
- PerAugy achieves up to 75% improvement in personalization metrics for some configurations
- Best-performing model shows 0.132 increase in AUC across tested user encoders
- Strong correlation between induced dataset diversity and model performance confirms diversity as key driver
- Consistent improvements demonstrated in cross-domain evaluation, particularly for low-resource domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PerAugy works by addressing the fundamental data scarcity problem in personalized text summarization through controlled data augmentation. The cross-trajectory shuffling technique combines user interaction patterns from different trajectories, creating synthetic examples that expose models to a wider variety of preference patterns than exist in the original dataset. Summary-content perturbation introduces controlled variations in the summary text while preserving core semantic content, effectively expanding the space of possible user preferences that models must learn to capture. Together, these techniques increase the diversity of training data, which directly translates to better generalization and more accurate user preference modeling. The strong correlation between diversity metrics and performance gains confirms that the augmentation successfully exposes models to the variety of user behaviors needed for effective personalization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-trajectory shuffling:** Combining elements from different user interaction sequences - needed to expose models to diverse preference patterns; quick check: verify synthetic trajectories maintain realistic user behavior patterns
- **Summary-content perturbation:** Controlled modification of summary text while preserving semantics - needed to expand the space of possible user preferences; quick check: ensure perturbations don't break core meaning through semantic consistency tests
- **User preference encoding:** Capturing individual user characteristics from interaction history - needed as foundation for personalization; quick check: validate that augmented data improves encoding accuracy on held-out users
- **Diversity metrics correlation:** Measuring relationship between dataset diversity and model performance - needed to validate augmentation effectiveness; quick check: establish statistical significance of diversity-performance relationship
- **Cross-domain generalization:** Evaluating performance across different domains - needed to ensure method applicability beyond training domains; quick check: test on low-resource domains with different interaction patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Preference History -> PerAugy Augmentation Engine -> Augmented Dataset -> User Encoder -> Personalized Summarizer

**Critical Path:**
1. User preference history collection and preprocessing
2. Cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation (PerAugy engine)
3. Augmented dataset generation and quality validation
4. Training of user encoders on augmented data
5. Integration with summarization framework for personalized output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The primary tradeoff involves balancing augmentation diversity against semantic coherence. More aggressive shuffling and perturbation increase diversity but risk generating unrealistic or semantically inconsistent examples. The method prioritizes diversity while maintaining semantic integrity through controlled perturbation techniques, accepting some risk of occasional low-quality synthetic examples for the benefit of overall dataset expansion.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor performance on users with unique or outlier preference patterns
- Degradation in summary coherence when augmentation is too aggressive
- Limited improvements when seed data quality is very low
- Reduced effectiveness when user interaction patterns differ significantly from training domains

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Run cross-trajectory shuffling alone to measure its isolated contribution to performance improvements
2. Apply summary-content perturbation to a small, high-quality dataset to evaluate quality preservation
3. Compare diversity metrics (e.g., entropy, coverage) between original and augmented datasets to establish baseline improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Dependency on access to both user preference histories and gold-reference summaries, which are rare in real-world scenarios
- Assumption that cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation preserve semantic coherence without systematic evaluation
- Primary validation on English-language datasets, raising questions about cross-linguistic applicability
- Heavy focus on AUC and personalization metrics without comprehensive human evaluation of summary quality

## Confidence
- **High:** Core augmentation methodology and effectiveness in increasing dataset diversity metrics
- **Medium:** Claim that increased diversity drives performance gains (inferred from correlation analysis)
- **Low:** Generalizability to non-English languages and domains with substantially different user interaction patterns

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether augmented summaries maintain coherence and informativeness alongside improved personalization
2. Test PerAugy's performance on non-English datasets and document any degradation or adaptation requirements
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each augmentation technique and determine if simpler strategies could achieve comparable results
