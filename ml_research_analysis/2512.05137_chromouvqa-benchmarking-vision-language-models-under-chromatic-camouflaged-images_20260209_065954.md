## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ChromouVQA, a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on chromatic camouflage images inspired by Ishihara plates. It contains 70,200 images derived from 17,100 silhouettes across 61 palette–shape configurations and nine VQA tasks including recognition, counting, and reasoning under camouflage conditions. Human participants achieve near-ceiling performance, while state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, especially under subtle chromatic contrast and non-dot fills. To improve performance, the authors propose a model-agnostic contrastive fine-tuning framework that aligns silhouette and camouflaged image embeddings, yielding consistent gains.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses 70,200 camouflaged images (512×512) derived from 17,100 silhouettes with 61 palette–shape configurations. Nine VQA tasks are evaluated: Count, Enumeration, Spot Difference, Size Comparison, Size Sort, Pattern Recognition, Rotation-Invariant Perception, Occlusion Reasoning, and Mathematical Calculation. A contrastive fine-tuning framework with InfoNCE loss aligns silhouette and camouflaged image embeddings, with total loss combining contrastive and VLM losses (α=0.5, τ=0.7). Training uses 8×A100 GPUs, batch size 16, and Adam optimizer for 2 epochs.

## Key Results
- Human baseline achieves 88.4% overall accuracy across all tasks
- Baseline VLM (Contra-Qwen) achieves 20.4% accuracy, struggling particularly with subtle chromatic contrast
- Contrastive fine-tuning improves accuracy to 61.0% overall, with reasoning tasks improving by 54-87%
- Larger VLMs underperform smaller ones due to noisy feature compression in low-resolution encoders
- Counting tasks benefit most from fine-tuning, while recognition tasks show moderate improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The contrastive fine-tuning framework works by explicitly training the vision encoder to recognize that camouflaged and silhouette versions of the same image share the same semantic content. By using silhouettes as anchors and camouflaged images as positives in an InfoNCE loss, the model learns to map both to similar embeddings despite the chromatic camouflage. This directly addresses the figure-ground segregation problem that causes VLMs to fail on these tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **InfoNCE Loss**: A contrastive learning objective that maximizes agreement between positive pairs while minimizing agreement with negative pairs; needed to align silhouette and camouflaged embeddings.
- **Vision-Language Pre-training**: The process by which VLMs learn cross-modal representations; needed to understand baseline capabilities and limitations.
- **Figure-Ground Segregation**: The visual ability to distinguish objects from background; needed to understand why chromatic camouflage is challenging.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting specific instructions for VLM task execution; needed to ensure consistent task evaluation across models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Vision Encoder -> Patch Embeddings -> Average Pooling -> Projection Layer -> InfoNCE Loss
Vision Encoder -> Patch Embeddings -> Average Pooling -> Language Model -> VQA Output

**Critical Path:**
Vision encoder extracts patch embeddings → Average pooling creates global image representation → Contrastive loss aligns silhouette and camouflaged embeddings → Language model processes combined vision-language features → VQA output generated

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Resolution vs. parameter count: Larger models use lower-resolution encoders, blurring chromatic edges
- Contrastive vs. task loss weighting: α=0.5 balances alignment learning with task performance
- Synthetic vs. real data: Synthetic images enable controlled testing but may not capture all real-world camouflage scenarios

**Failure Signatures:**
- Baseline accuracy below 20%: Likely vision encoder downsampling or color space issues
- No improvement after fine-tuning: Incorrect negative sampling or improper loss balance
- Reasoning tasks underperform counting: Fine-tuning may overfit to simpler pattern recognition

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Verify baseline VLM performance on clean silhouette images to establish upper bound
2. Test contrastive fine-tuning with different α values (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) to find optimal balance
3. Evaluate model performance on subtle vs. obvious chromatic contrasts to identify failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does VLM performance scale when the benchmark is expanded to include more diverse patterns and task types beyond the current nine?
- Can vision encoders be designed to preserve fine chromatic edges without suffering from the "noisy feature compression" that causes larger models to underperform smaller ones?
- Does the contrastive adaptation framework developed for synthetic Ishihara-style images generalize to safety-critical real-world scenarios where chromatic camouflage disrupts local cues?

## Limitations
- The human baseline was established on a subset of 12,000 images, but the selection process and inter-rater agreement are not detailed
- Train/test split composition is unclear beyond the 10,800 pairs used for fine-tuning, raising questions about potential data leakage
- Evaluation methodology relies on GPT-4o-mini for open-ended response assessment, but exact criteria for correct/incorrect classification remain unspecified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The existence of a performance gap between humans and VLMs on chromatic camouflage tasks is well-established through the reported baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the contrastive fine-tuning approach is supported by ablation studies, though the specific improvements per task may vary with different evaluation protocols
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that current VLMs struggle with figure-ground segregation is reasonable given the performance data, but the specific mechanisms underlying these failures require further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Reconstruct the exact evaluation protocol for GPT-4o-mini assessment, including prompt templates and criteria for correct/incorrect classification across all 9 VQA tasks
2. Verify the train/test split integrity by confirming that no silhouette-camo pairs from the test set appear in the fine-tuning data, and analyze per-task distribution differences
3. Conduct a small-scale human re-evaluation study (n=20 participants) on a randomly selected subset of 1,000 images to confirm the 88.4% baseline accuracy and assess inter-rater reliability
