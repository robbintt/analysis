## Executive Summary
CRaFT introduces a novel explanation-based framework for evaluating cultural reasoning in multilingual large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on accuracy alone, CRaFT uses four interpretable metrics—Cultural Fluency, Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation—to assess how models reason across cultural contexts. The framework is applied to 50 culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluated across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs from three models (GPT, DeepSeek, FANAR). Results reveal significant cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

## Method Summary
CRaFT employs a novel explanation-based approach to evaluate cultural reasoning in multilingual LLMs. The framework translates culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey into multiple languages (Arabic, Bengali, Spanish) and evaluates model responses using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency (coherence with cultural context), Deviation (consistency across languages), Consistency (stability of reasoning), and Linguistic Adaptation (flexibility in language use). Models generate both answers and explanations, which are then analyzed using GPT-4 for automated evaluation. The approach moves beyond traditional accuracy metrics to assess the quality and adaptability of cultural reasoning across linguistic contexts.

## Key Results
- Arabic translation reduces cultural fluency scores while Bengali enhances them, with Spanish showing relative stability
- GPT demonstrates superior linguistic adaptation across languages but lower consistency compared to other models
- FANAR exhibits stable but rigid reasoning patterns across all languages
- Cultural reasoning quality varies significantly based on linguistic framing rather than being intrinsic to the model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging explanations as interpretable artifacts that reveal the reasoning process behind cultural judgments. By requiring models to justify their answers, CRaFT can assess not just what conclusions models reach but how they arrive at them across different cultural contexts. The automated evaluation using GPT-4 provides scalable assessment of explanation quality, while the multi-metric approach captures different dimensions of cultural reasoning performance that single metrics would miss.

## Foundational Learning
- Cultural reasoning evaluation - needed to assess how LLMs handle context-dependent judgments across languages; quick check: verify metrics capture both explicit and implicit cultural knowledge
- Multilingual translation effects - needed to understand how language choice impacts reasoning quality; quick check: compare performance across linguistically diverse language families
- Explanation-based assessment - needed to make cultural reasoning transparent and interpretable; quick check: ensure explanations are both culturally appropriate and linguistically coherent
- Cross-cultural consistency measurement - needed to evaluate whether models maintain stable reasoning across cultural contexts; quick check: test for systematic deviations in specific cultural dimensions
- Automated cultural evaluation - needed for scalable assessment of large numbers of responses; quick check: validate automated scores against human expert judgments

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: WVS Questions -> Translation -> Model Generation -> GPT-4 Evaluation -> Metric Calculation -> Analysis
- Critical path: Translation → Model Generation → Explanation Extraction → GPT-4 Evaluation → Metric Aggregation
- Design tradeoffs: automated evaluation vs. human expertise (speed vs. nuance), multiple metrics vs. simplicity (comprehensiveness vs. interpretability), explanation requirement vs. model flexibility (transparency vs. coverage)
- Failure signatures: inconsistent metric scores across evaluators, language-specific reasoning breakdowns, explanation quality degradation in certain cultural contexts
- First experiments: 1) Test framework on additional culturally neutral questions, 2) Evaluate single-language responses to establish baseline performance, 3) Compare automated vs. human evaluation scores for calibration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited language sample (three languages) restricts generalizability across linguistic families
- Reliance on GPT-4 for evaluation introduces potential circularity and evaluator bias
- Framework depends on human-generated explanations which may not capture implicit reasoning patterns
- Cultural scope limited to World Values Survey questions, missing other cultural dimensions

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodological framework and its applicability to multilingual cultural reasoning evaluation
- Medium confidence in specific quantitative findings due to limited language sample and potential evaluator bias
- Low confidence in generalizability of cultural reasoning patterns across different cultural dimensions not represented in the WVS dataset

## Next Checks
1. Apply CRaFT to additional languages from diverse linguistic families (e.g., East Asian, Slavic, indigenous languages) to test framework robustness and identify language-specific patterns in cultural reasoning
2. Validate findings using alternative cultural knowledge sources beyond WVS, such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions or country-specific cultural datasets, to assess framework adaptability
3. Implement blind evaluation protocols where cultural reasoning explanations are assessed by human experts from the respective language communities to ground-truth the automated evaluation metrics
