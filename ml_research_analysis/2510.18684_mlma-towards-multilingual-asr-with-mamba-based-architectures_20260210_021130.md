# MLMA: Towards Multilingual ASR With Mamba-based Architectures

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.18684
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18684
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: MLMA outperforms Conformer baselines on multilingual ASR tasks using Mamba-based architecture

## Executive Summary
MLMA introduces a multilingual automatic speech recognition system leveraging the Mamba state-space architecture for improved efficiency and scalability. The system employs ConMamba encoders with CTC decoding and trains on nearly 12,000 hours across six European languages. MLMA demonstrates competitive performance on both in-domain (LibriSpeech, CommonVoice) and out-of-domain (FLEURS) evaluations, showing that Mamba-based models can serve as effective backbones for large-scale multilingual ASR systems.

## Method Summary
MLMA uses ConMamba encoders as the core architecture, replacing traditional Transformer-based components with state-space models. The system employs CTC decoding and is trained on a multilingual dataset spanning six European languages with approximately 12,000 hours of speech data. The architecture focuses on capturing long-range dependencies efficiently while maintaining computational tractability for large-scale training.

## Key Results
- MLMA outperforms Conformer baselines on LibriSpeech and CommonVoice datasets
- Competitive performance achieved on FLEURS out-of-domain evaluation
- Performance gains confirmed through ablation studies showing benefits from increased model size and training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MLMA leverages the Mamba state-space architecture to capture long-range dependencies in speech signals more efficiently than traditional attention-based models. The ConMamba encoder replaces standard Transformer blocks, reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance. This architectural choice enables better scalability for multilingual ASR tasks where modeling diverse phonetic patterns across languages is crucial.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mamba state-space models**: Efficient sequence modeling using state-space representations instead of attention mechanisms; needed for capturing long-range dependencies with lower computational cost
- **CTC decoding**: Connectionist Temporal Classification for sequence-to-sequence mapping without explicit alignment; needed for end-to-end ASR training
- **Multilingual ASR**: Joint modeling of multiple languages in a single system; needed for scalable speech recognition across diverse languages
- **Conformer architecture**: Hybrid of convolution and self-attention for speech processing; needed as baseline comparison and architectural foundation
- **Speech duration modeling**: Understanding temporal aspects of speech signals; needed for accurate transcription across different speaking rates

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw audio -> ConMamba encoder -> CTC decoder -> Transcriptions
- **Critical path**: Input speech features flow through ConMamba layers for contextual encoding, then through CTC for sequence prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Mamba vs attention - reduced computational complexity at potential cost of some modeling flexibility; larger models vs efficiency
- **Failure signatures**: Potential issues with very short or very long sequences; possible degradation on languages with limited training data
- **First experiments**: 1) Compare single-language vs multilingual training performance, 2) Vary model depth and width to find optimal configuration, 3) Test on additional out-of-domain datasets for generalization assessment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Limited language coverage (six European languages only)
- Evaluation focused primarily on ASR metrics without exploring broader multilingual transfer capabilities
- No analysis of potential biases across different demographic groups
- Computational efficiency gains compared to Conformer not thoroughly quantified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: MLMA's architecture and training methodology are sound, with clear improvements over Conformer baselines on tested datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about scalability and efficiency improvements require more extensive benchmarking across varied computational environments
- **Medium confidence**: Out-of-domain performance on FLEURS suggests generalization capability, but broader multilingual generalization remains to be validated

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MLMA on a more diverse set of languages and speech tasks beyond the current European language focus
2. Conduct extensive computational efficiency benchmarking comparing MLMA to Conformer across different hardware configurations and batch sizes
3. Test model robustness and bias across different demographic groups using standardized evaluation frameworks for speech recognition systems
