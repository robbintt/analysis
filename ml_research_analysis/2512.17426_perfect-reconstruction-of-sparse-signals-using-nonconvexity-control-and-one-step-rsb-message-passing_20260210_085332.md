# Perfect reconstruction of sparse signals using nonconvexity control and one-step RSB message passing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17426
- Reference count: 30
- The paper develops a one-step replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) extension of approximate message passing (AMP) for compressed sensing with the SCAD penalty

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a one-step replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) extension of approximate message passing (AMP) for compressed sensing with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty. The key innovation lies in applying the 1RSB framework to navigate nonconvex optimization landscapes more effectively than the replica-symmetric approach, particularly in regions where RS-AMP diverges. The authors derive explicit update rules for 1RSB-AMP and corresponding state evolution equations, and propose a new criterion for optimizing the Parisi parameter by minimizing the size of the diverging region rather than using the conventional zero-complexity condition.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a one-step replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) extension of approximate message passing (AMP) for compressed sensing with the SCAD penalty. The method applies 1RSB framework to navigate nonconvex optimization landscapes more effectively than the replica-symmetric approach. The authors derive explicit update rules for 1RSB-AMP and corresponding state evolution equations, and propose a new criterion for optimizing the Parisi parameter by minimizing the size of the diverging region rather than using the conventional zero-complexity condition. When combined with the nonconvexity-control protocol, the 1RSB-AMP achieves improved algorithmic limits for perfect reconstruction compared to RS-AMP.

## Key Results
- 1RSB-AMP achieves a modestly improved algorithmic limit for perfect reconstruction compared to RS-AMP
- The method remains slightly inferior to the Bayes-optimal threshold
- The 1RSB-AMP and 1RSB-SE agree remarkably well at the macroscopic level even in parameter regions where RS-AMP fails
- The paper characterizes thermodynamic properties including overlaps, free entropy, complexity, and non-self-averaging susceptibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The 1RSB framework captures the multi-modal nature of the energy landscape in nonconvex optimization problems, allowing the algorithm to navigate through multiple metastable states rather than being trapped in a single local minimum. By incorporating replica-symmetry-breaking into the message passing updates, the method can better handle the complex correlations that arise in high-dimensional sparse signal recovery problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB)**: Necessary to capture the complex energy landscape structure in nonconvex optimization; check by verifying agreement with known results in simpler settings
- **Approximate message passing (AMP)**: Framework for iterative signal recovery; check by verifying state evolution predictions against empirical performance
- **State evolution equations**: Predict macroscopic behavior of AMP algorithms; check by comparing theoretical predictions with simulation results
- **Nonconvexity control**: Protocol to stabilize nonconvex optimization; check by monitoring convergence behavior in different parameter regimes
- **Parisi parameter optimization**: Controls the extent of replica-symmetry-breaking; check by testing different optimization criteria for algorithm performance
- **SCAD penalty**: Nonconvex regularization function for sparse recovery; check by comparing performance against other sparsity-inducing penalties

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Compressed sensing problem -> Measurement matrix -> SCAD penalty -> 1RSB-AMP algorithm -> Signal reconstruction

**Critical path**: Measurement acquisition → 1RSB-AMP iterations → State evolution monitoring → Convergence checking → Reconstruction output

**Design tradeoffs**: The 1RSB-AMP provides better convergence properties in nonconvex regions at the cost of increased computational complexity compared to RS-AMP. The choice of Parisi parameter represents a balance between algorithmic stability and reconstruction accuracy.

**Failure signatures**: Divergence of state evolution equations, failure to converge within maximum iterations, poor reconstruction quality despite convergence, violation of non-self-averaging conditions.

**First experiments**:
1. Test 1RSB-AMP convergence on synthetic sparse signals with varying sparsity levels
2. Compare reconstruction error versus iteration count between RS-AMP and 1RSB-AMP
3. Verify state evolution predictions against empirical performance on moderate-sized problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Major uncertainties remain regarding the practical scalability of the 1RSB-AMP algorithm to large-scale problems
- The claim of "modestly improved algorithmic limit" needs quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods
- The thermodynamic characterization relies on mean-field approximations whose validity in finite-dimensional settings remains unverified

## Confidence

- High confidence in the theoretical derivation of 1RSB-AMP update rules and state evolution equations
- Medium confidence in the practical effectiveness of the nonconvexity-control protocol given limited experimental validation
- Medium confidence in the Parisi parameter optimization criterion, as alternative optimization strategies may exist
- Low confidence in the thermodynamic analysis predictions for finite-size systems

## Next Checks

1. Implement and benchmark 1RSB-AMP against modern convex optimization methods (e.g., ADMM, FISTA) on standard sparse signal reconstruction datasets
2. Perform finite-size scaling analysis to verify the mean-field predictions for overlap distributions and complexity function
3. Test the algorithm's performance on real-world compressed sensing applications with structured sparsity patterns beyond iid Gaussian measurement matrices
