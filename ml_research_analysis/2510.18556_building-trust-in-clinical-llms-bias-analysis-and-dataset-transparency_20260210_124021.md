# Building Trust in Clinical LLMs: Bias Analysis and Dataset Transparency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18556
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18556
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Introduces HC4 dataset and bias evaluation framework showing significant sensitivity to demographic information with varying patterns across model architectures and training data

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical need for transparency and bias evaluation in clinical large language models by introducing the Healthcare Comprehensive Commons Corpus (HC4), an 89 billion token dataset specifically curated for healthcare applications. The research develops a novel bias evaluation framework combining established general benchmarks with a healthcare-specific methodology focused on differential opioid prescription tendencies across demographic groups. Training nine distinct language models across three architectures (GPT-2, Llama-3, Mistral) on three different datasets (HC4, SlimPajama, FineWeb), the analysis reveals significant sensitivity to demographic information with varying bias patterns depending on model architecture and training data.

The findings demonstrate that rigorous bias analysis must be an integral part of dataset and model development in healthcare AI, with models amplifying or mitigating existing biases in training data in distinct, often unpredictable ways. Notably, HC4-trained models exhibited unique overprescription tendencies for certain ethnic groups ("American Indian or Alaska Native" and "Middle Eastern or North African") while under-prescribing for elderly patients, contrasting with general domain models. The research establishes a framework for ongoing evaluation and highlights the importance of dataset transparency in building trustworthy clinical AI systems.

## Method Summary
The research developed a comprehensive bias evaluation framework for clinical large language models by training nine distinct models across three architectures (GPT-2, Llama-3, Mistral) using three different datasets (HC4, SlimPajama, FineWeb). The HC4 dataset, specifically curated for healthcare applications, contains 89 billion tokens from medical textbooks, journals, clinical notes, and health-related web content. The bias evaluation methodology combined general domain benchmarks (HH-Index, AAAI Bias Benchmark, ChemBench, BIG-bench) with a novel healthcare-specific approach focusing on opioid prescription decisions across demographic groups. Models were evaluated using both standard language modeling benchmarks and a differential prescription tendency analysis that examined how demographic information influenced clinical decision-making.

## Key Results
- HC4-trained models showed unique overprescription tendencies for "American Indian or Alaska Native" and "Middle Eastern or North African" groups while under-prescribing for elderly patients
- Significant variation in bias patterns observed across different model architectures when trained on the same dataset
- General domain models (trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb) demonstrated different bias patterns compared to healthcare-specific HC4-trained models
- Models exhibited sensitivity to demographic information that varied unpredictably depending on both architecture and training data composition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The bias patterns emerge from the interaction between training data composition and model architecture-specific learning dynamics. Healthcare-specific datasets like HC4 contain different demographic distributions and clinical contexts compared to general domain data, leading models to develop distinct associations between demographic features and clinical decisions. The opioid prescription task serves as a sensitive probe because it involves both clinical judgment and social factors that may be influenced by implicit biases in training data. Model architectures process and weight these patterns differently during training, resulting in architecture-dependent amplification or mitigation of biases present in the source data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Healthcare-specific tokenization** - Needed because medical terminology requires specialized vocabulary handling; quick check: tokenization coverage on medical domain-specific corpora
- **Bias evaluation frameworks** - Essential for quantifying fairness in clinical decision-making; quick check: benchmark performance across diverse demographic scenarios
- **Demographic-aware prompting** - Critical for testing how models respond to protected characteristics; quick check: consistency of outputs across demographic variations
- **Cross-architecture bias comparison** - Important for understanding which model families are more susceptible to demographic bias; quick check: bias pattern consistency across architectures trained on identical data
- **Dataset transparency metrics** - Necessary for understanding potential bias sources in training data; quick check: demographic distribution analysis of training corpora
- **Clinical task sensitivity** - Required because different medical decisions may exhibit different bias patterns; quick check: bias consistency across multiple clinical tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Preparation -> Model Training -> Bias Evaluation -> Clinical Validation

**Critical Path**
The critical path follows: dataset curation and cleaning → model architecture selection and training → bias evaluation framework implementation → demographic sensitivity analysis → result interpretation and validation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Healthcare-specific vs. general domain data: HC4 provides medical relevance but may have limited demographic diversity compared to general web data
- Model complexity vs. interpretability: Larger models may capture more nuanced patterns but are harder to analyze for bias sources
- Synthetic vs. real clinical data: Synthetic scenarios allow controlled testing but may not reflect real-world complexity

**Failure Signatures**
- Unexpected bias amplification in specific demographic groups
- Inconsistent bias patterns across different model architectures
- Overfitting to demographic patterns present in training data
- Failure to generalize bias evaluation to different clinical tasks

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare bias patterns in models trained on HC4 versus models fine-tuned on HC4 from general domain checkpoints
2. Test bias sensitivity across multiple clinical decision tasks (diagnosis, treatment selection, prognosis)
3. Evaluate intersectional bias patterns by combining multiple demographic attributes in evaluation prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis constrained by relatively small sample size of models (nine total) and limited diversity in training dataset sources
- Opioid prescription task represents a narrow slice of healthcare decision-making and may not capture broader bias patterns
- Demographic groupings used for analysis may oversimplify complex intersectional identities that influence clinical decision-making

## Confidence
- **High**: Methodological framework for bias evaluation and observation that model architecture and training data significantly influence bias patterns
- **Medium**: Specific quantitative results regarding demographic group differences, sensitive to dataset composition and evaluation methodology
- **Low**: Claims about real-world clinical impact, as study uses synthetic patient scenarios rather than actual clinical data

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the bias analysis using additional healthcare-specific datasets with different demographic distributions to assess result stability
2. Expand the bias evaluation to multiple clinical tasks beyond opioid prescription, including diagnosis and treatment recommendation scenarios
3. Conduct blinded evaluation with clinical experts to validate whether observed bias patterns align with known clinical decision-making patterns and actual patient outcomes
