# Toward Ethical AI Through Bayesian Uncertainty in Neural Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.17677
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17677
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: Bayesian uncertainty quantification enables neural QA models to abstain when uncertain, improving reliability and interpretability

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how Bayesian uncertainty quantification can improve the reliability of neural question-answering models. Starting with a simple multilayer perceptron on the Iris dataset, the work demonstrates how posterior inference yields calibrated confidence estimates. These concepts are then extended to transformer-based models: first by applying Bayesian inference to a frozen classification head, and then to LoRA-adapted transformers using a Laplace approximation on the CommonsenseQA benchmark. Rather than maximizing accuracy, the experiments focus on uncertainty calibration and selective prediction, showing that models can abstain when confidence is low. Reliability diagrams and accuracy-coverage curves demonstrate that Bayesian methods produce more cautious, interpretable predictions, supporting the view that Bayesian reasoning can make neural QA systems more trustworthy and ethically aligned.

## Method Summary
The approach begins with Bayesian inference on an MLP trained on the Iris dataset using MCMC sampling to capture posterior parameter distributions. This is extended to transformer-based QA by first applying Bayesian inference to a frozen classification head using HMC/NUTS in NumPyro, then to LoRA-adapted transformers via a Laplace approximation. For the transformer case, LoRA adapters are attached to the last two transformer layers, and after training to a MAP solution, the empirical Fisher information is computed to estimate posterior variance. At inference, S_MC ≈ 30 parameter samples are drawn from the Gaussian posterior, and predictions are averaged. The method enables selective prediction through confidence thresholds, allowing models to abstain when uncertainty is high.

## Key Results
- Bayesian methods enable neural QA models to express calibrated uncertainty through posterior predictive distributions
- Reliability diagrams show predicted confidence correlates well with empirical accuracy, demonstrating effective calibration
- Accuracy-coverage curves demonstrate selective prediction: higher confidence thresholds lead to fewer answered questions but higher accuracy on answered cases
- The "I don't know" capability improves interpretability and illustrates how Bayesian methods can contribute to more responsible AI deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Posterior inference captures epistemic uncertainty
Treating neural network parameters as random variables with posterior distributions yields predictive distributions that quantify epistemic uncertainty. Standard training produces point estimates θ; Bayesian inference computes a posterior p(θ|D) ∝ p(D|θ)p(θ) and marginalizes: p(y|x,D) = ∫ p(y|x,θ) p(θ|D) dθ. For intractable posteriors, MCMC (small models) or Laplace approximation (large models) provides samples. Core assumption: The approximate posterior (Gaussian via Laplace, or MCMC samples) sufficiently captures true parameter uncertainty.

### Mechanism 2: Selective prediction via confidence thresholds
Posterior predictive variance enables selective prediction—models can abstain when confidence is low, improving reliability on answered cases. Given a confidence threshold τ, the model returns "I don't know" if max p(y|x) < τ. As τ increases, coverage (fraction answered) decreases while accuracy on answered cases rises. Accuracy-coverage curves quantify this trade-off. Core assumption: Predicted confidence correlates with empirical correctness (calibration holds).

### Mechanism 3: Empirical Fisher information captures parameter sensitivity
The empirical Fisher information matrix captures parameter sensitivity, enabling tractable Laplace posteriors for large models. F(θ) = E[∇θ log p(y|x,θ) ∇θ log p(y|x,θ)⊤] measures how likelihood changes with parameters. The diagonal approximation averages squared gradients; the inverse Fisher gives posterior variance. Posterior predictive samples are drawn from N(θ_MAP, F⁻¹). Core assumption: The loss surface is approximately quadratic near θ_MAP, justifying a Gaussian posterior.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bayesian Inference and the Posterior**: Understanding prior, likelihood, and posterior relationships is essential since the entire method transforms point estimates into distributions via Bayes' rule. Quick check: Given prior p(θ) and likelihood p(D|θ), write the expression for the posterior p(θ|D).

- **Monte Carlo Integration**: The paper uses HMC/NUTS for small heads and MC sampling from Laplace for large heads to approximate predictive distributions; understanding why we sample (and average) is essential. Quick check: Why is p(y|x,D) = ∫ p(y|x,θ) p(θ|D) dθ intractable for neural networks?

- **Fisher Information and Curvature**: The Laplace approximation uses Fisher to estimate posterior variance; understanding what Fisher captures (sensitivity of likelihood to parameter changes) clarifies what the method approximates. Quick check: What does a large diagonal entry F_ii indicate about parameter θ_i?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pretrained transformer (frozen) -> LoRA adapters (last 2 layers) -> Classification head -> Bayesian posterior wrapper -> Inference sampler

- **Critical path**: 1) Load pretrained transformer → freeze backbone; 2) Attach LoRA adapters to target layers (last 2 transformer layers); 3) Train MAP solution on head + LoRA parameters via standard fine-tuning; 4) Compute diagonal empirical Fisher over training set (average squared gradients); 5) At inference: sample parameter perturbations from N(θ_MAP, diag(F)⁻¹), average predictions.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Diagonal vs full Fisher: Diagonal is O(P) and scalable but ignores correlations; full is O(P²) and often intractable. MCMC vs Laplace: MCMC (HMC/NUTS) is more accurate but limited to small parameter sets (~7K in Experiment 2); Laplace scales but assumes unimodal Gaussian. Coverage vs accuracy: Higher thresholds → fewer answered questions → higher accuracy on answered subset.

- **Failure signatures**: Overconfident wrong predictions: High probability on incorrect class (Fig. 5b, Entry 2); requires calibration check. Flat accuracy-coverage curve: Confidence provides no signal for selective prediction. Posterior collapse (near-zero variance): Numerical issues in Fisher computation or overparameterization. Excessive variance: Mean predictions collapse toward uniform; prior too weak or Fisher poorly estimated.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce Iris MLP + MCMC with NumPyro/NUTS; visualize prior vs posterior for selected weights; confirm posterior concentrates after conditioning on data. 2) Validate calibration on held-out set: Compute reliability diagram; verify predicted confidence ≈ empirical accuracy; plot accuracy-coverage curve. 3) Implement Laplace on frozen BERT head: Train linear head on CommonsenseQA subset, compute diagonal Fisher, sample S=30 perturbations, compare MAP vs Laplace accuracy-coverage curves.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can domain-specific priors improve uncertainty calibration over standard Gaussian priors?**: The discussion section explicitly calls for future work to "explore richer priors" to enhance the Bayesian treatment. Experiments utilize standard priors; it's unclear if structured or informative priors would tighten posteriors or improve abstention accuracy on the CommonsenseQA benchmark. A comparison of standard Gaussian priors against hierarchical or sparsity-inducing priors, measuring Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and selective prediction accuracy, would resolve this.

- **How can Bayesian uncertainty quantification be extended from discriminative classification heads to generative decoding in Large Language Models?**: The introduction claims the work "lay[s] groundwork for broader applications in generative AI," yet all experiments are restricted to discriminative setups (multiple-choice classification). Generative text involves sequential token prediction, making the marginalization of parameters significantly more complex than the single-pass classification heads evaluated in the study. Applying the Laplace-LoRA method to an autoregressive LLM and measuring sequence-level uncertainty or hallucination rates would resolve this.

- **Does the "I don't know" abstention capability measurably improve outcomes in human-AI collaboration tasks?**: The authors identify "education or human-AI collaboration" as specific downstream tasks where abstention has clear value requiring further study. The paper validates technical calibration via reliability diagrams but does not verify if human users correctly interpret or utilize the model's uncertainty to make better decisions. A user study measuring task completion time and trust scores when humans interact with an abstaining model versus a standard model in a decision-support setting would resolve this.

## Limitations

- The Laplace approximation's diagonal Fisher is scalable but known to underestimate uncertainty when posterior correlations are strong; the paper does not test full Fisher or MCMC for the LoRA model.
- Calibration results are based on a simplified 3-option CommonsenseQA version; performance on the full 5-option task and other QA benchmarks remains untested.
- The empirical Fisher computation assumes the training loss landscape is well-behaved and unimodal near the MAP solution, which may not hold for complex transformer parameter spaces.

## Confidence

- **High**: Bayesian methods can quantify uncertainty in neural QA models; selective prediction via confidence thresholds is feasible and improves accuracy on answered cases.
- **Medium**: Laplace approximation with diagonal Fisher provides a tractable and useful uncertainty estimate for LoRA-adapted transformers; the empirical Fisher captures relevant sensitivity for calibration.
- **Low**: The specific implementation details (LoRA rank, training hyperparameters, damping strategy) do not materially affect the qualitative conclusions about uncertainty quantification.

## Next Checks

1. **Full vs diagonal Fisher comparison**: Implement full Fisher for the small MLP case; compare posterior variances and calibration curves to quantify the impact of diagonal approximation.
2. **Robustness to LoRA configuration**: Vary LoRA rank (r=4,8,16) and test whether uncertainty calibration and selective prediction performance remain stable across configurations.
3. **Out-of-distribution stress test**: Evaluate calibration and selective prediction on a held-out CommonsenseQA subset with semantically challenging or adversarial questions to test whether Bayesian methods maintain reliability under distribution shift.
