- Key outcome: First benchmark replicating full professional survey pipeline with four tasks; two-stage fine-tuning produces 10-20% gains over general LLMs with improved fairness for underrepresented groups

## Executive Summary
AlignSurvey introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for aligning large language models with human preferences in social surveys, replicating the complete pipeline from demographic modeling through structured response generation. The benchmark defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling, and survey response modeling. A two-stage fine-tuning approach using a 44K+ interview dialogue foundation corpus and expert-annotated task datasets enables SurveyLM models to significantly outperform general-purpose LLMs, achieving 10-20% gains while demonstrating improved performance and fairness for underrepresented demographic groups.

## Method Summary
AlignSurvey constructs a multi-tiered dataset architecture including the Social Foundation Corpus (44K+ interview dialogues, 400K+ survey records from ATP/ESS/CSS/CGSS) and Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets for task-specific supervision. The SurveyLM model family undergoes two-stage fine-tuning: Stage I on the foundation corpus to learn social discourse patterns and demographic reasoning, followed by Stage II on task-specific datasets with expert annotations and demographic metadata. Models are evaluated across all four tasks using metrics including accuracy, ROUGE, and Wasserstein distance for group-level distribution alignment, with particular focus on demographic diversity and fairness for underrepresented populations.

## Key Results
- SurveyLM models achieve 10-20% performance gains over general-purpose LLMs across all four benchmark tasks
- Demographic alignment improvements show 48-55% accuracy vs 35-44% for baselines in social role modeling
- Group-level stance prediction demonstrates superior Wasserstein distance metrics, indicating better population distribution alignment
- Underrepresented groups (rural, elderly 76+, low-income) show 10-15% accuracy improvements over baseline models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Two-stage alignment (foundation pre-training → task-specific SFT) produces significantly better survey alignment than either stage alone or single-stage approaches. Stage I on the Social Foundation Corpus equips base models with social discourse patterns and demographic reasoning, while Stage II on task-specific datasets refines these capabilities for precise survey operations. Evidence shows ablation removing task SFT drops Task 4 accuracy from ~55% to ~35% and Wasserstein distance from ~0.05 to ~2.0.

### Mechanism 2
Demographic-conditional prompting with expert-annotated reasoning chains enables accurate group-level distribution prediction, not just individual responses. Models learn to associate demographic profiles with stance patterns via supervised reasoning chains, then condition on group profiles to aggregate individual predictions into distributions measured by Wasserstein distance. Results show SurveyLM reduces accuracy gaps for rural, elderly (76+), and low-income groups vs. baselines.

### Mechanism 3
Full-pipeline evaluation (Tasks 1→2→3→4) reveals task interdependencies that single-task benchmarks miss. Performance on Task 4 correlates with Task 1 accuracy, demonstrating that survey fidelity requires competency across all stages. The approach exposes weaknesses that would be missed by single-task evaluation, with group-level Wasserstein distance revealing failures even when individual accuracy appears acceptable.

## Foundational Learning

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Enables efficient fine-tuning of 7B models on multi-task survey data without full parameter updates. Quick check: Can you explain why rank-8 LoRA targeting attention and FFN layers preserves base model knowledge while adapting to survey tasks?

- **Wasserstein Distance for Distribution Alignment**: Measures how well predicted group-level response distributions match ground truth; sensitive to ordering of ordinal stance labels (positive/neutral/negative). Quick check: Why is Wasserstein distance preferred over KL divergence for comparing stance distributions with natural ordering?

- **Demographic-Conditional Prompting**: Core technique for simulating respondents; requires structuring profiles (age, income, region, occupation) as conditioning context. Quick check: How does option shuffling during training mitigate position bias in structured response modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Social Foundation Corpus → Stage I fine-tuning → Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets → Stage II task-specific SFT → SurveyLM models → Evaluation Suite (Tasks 1-4)

- **Critical path**: 1) Load Social Foundation Corpus → Stage I fine-tuning (1 epoch, lr=1e-4, cosine decay) 2) Load ASE + GSS + CHIP → Stage II task-specific SFT (3 epochs per task) 3) Run evaluation across all 4 tasks → Report individual accuracy + group Wasserstein distance

- **Design tradeoffs**: Foundation corpus breadth vs. task specificity (ablation shows removing foundation causes moderate drops; removing task SFT causes severe degradation); Model scale vs. efficiency (7B SurveyLM models outperform 72B Qwen baseline); Qualitative vs. quantitative focus (including interview dialogues adds complexity but captures real survey workflows)

- **Failure signatures**: Central-tendency bias (baseline models default to midpoint responses; F1 remains low ~25% despite moderate accuracy); Underrepresented group collapse (zero-shot GPT-4o shows <10% accuracy on rural/elderly/low-income demographics); Reasoning chain hallucination (without expert-annotated chains, generated justifications diverge from actual respondent logic)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce Stage I + II pipeline on Qwen2.5-7B with provided corpus; validate Task 4 Wasserstein distance <0.10 on ASE 2) Ablate foundation corpus: Train only on ASE task data; expect ~10% accuracy drop and Wasserstein distance increase 3) Cross-dataset transfer test: Train on ASE + CHIP, evaluate on GSS; report demographic subgroup accuracy gaps to verify generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Iterative human-in-the-loop feedback**: How can iterative human-in-the-loop feedback be effectively integrated into the alignment pipeline to refine SurveyLM beyond static expert annotations? The current model relies on a fixed two-stage alignment strategy using static datasets; the paper does not explore dynamic, interactive learning paradigms. Experiments showing performance gains or sample efficiency improvements using active learning or RLHF specifically designed for survey response generation would resolve this.

- **Cross-cultural generalizability**: Can SurveyLM maintain high alignment fidelity when applied to cultural contexts or languages not explicitly covered in the training corpus? The current benchmark focuses primarily on Chinese and U.S. contexts, leaving cross-cultural generalizability to unseen regions unproven. Zero-shot evaluation results on high-quality social surveys from regions outside the current training distribution (e.g., African or South American contexts) would resolve this.

- **Source bias in foundation corpus**: Does the reliance on the Social Foundation Corpus (sourced from public video platforms) re-introduce demographic bias regarding digitally active populations? While the paper demonstrates improved fairness, it does not analyze if the source of the foundational qualitative data limits the authenticity of simulating populations typically excluded from internet video content. A comparative error analysis of model fidelity on demographic subgroups with high versus low representation in the video-based foundation corpus would resolve this.

## Limitations

- The two-stage fine-tuning pipeline reproducibility depends on access to exact train/test splits and LLM evaluator configurations, particularly the demographic fingerprint-based splitting method for ASE
- Demographic fairness improvements depend on training data representativeness that isn't fully characterized, making generalization claims uncertain
- Cross-dataset generalization remains untested beyond internal validation, and the exact impact of foundation corpus breadth versus task-specific data quality cannot be fully assessed

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The two-stage alignment mechanism and task pipeline design are well-supported by ablation studies and internal consistency across tasks
- **Medium Confidence**: Demographic fairness improvements for underrepresented groups, while measured through multiple metrics, depend on training data representativeness
- **Low Confidence**: Cross-dataset generalization claims remain untested beyond internal validation, and the exact impact of foundation corpus breadth versus task-specific data quality cannot be fully assessed

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce Stage I+II pipeline on Qwen2.5-7B with provided corpus; validate Task 4 Wasserstein distance <0.10 on ASE
2. Ablate foundation corpus: Train only on ASE task data; expect ~10% accuracy drop and Wasserstein distance increase
3. Cross-dataset transfer test: Train on ASE + CHIP, evaluate on GSS; report demographic subgroup accuracy gaps to verify generalization
