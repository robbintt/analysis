- Large language models can be steered to control tense and aspect during multi-token generation using interpretable directions in residual space.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how large language models encode and control grammatical features—specifically tense and aspect—which describe the temporal structure of verbs. Prior work largely focused on binary contrasts and single-token evaluations, but tense and aspect are multidimensional and can be combined in numerous ways. The authors propose a new method to identify these features in LLM residual space using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and demonstrate that they form orthogonal, interpretable directions. Through targeted steering, they causally manipulate tense and aspect during multi-token generation, finding that steering is more effective when applied to generated tokens rather than the prompt, and just before the target verb. They also find that optimal steering strength depends on model and layer-specific activation norms. Steering efficacy is higher for tense than aspect and more stable in few-shot tasks than open-ended generation. However, steering can still cause side effects like topic shift or degeneration, especially with strong interventions. The results suggest that LLMs represent tense and aspect in a human-like, structured way, but effective control requires careful tuning of intervention location, strength, and timing.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a method to discover interpretable directions in the residual space of large language models that correspond to grammatical features, specifically tense and aspect. They used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to identify these directions by comparing embeddings from different tense and aspect categories. Once identified, they applied steering interventions to these directions during multi-token generation to causally manipulate the grammatical features of generated text. The steering was applied by adding a scaled direction vector to the residual activations at specific layers and token positions. They systematically varied the steering strength, location (prompt vs. generated tokens), and timing (which token position relative to the target verb) to optimize control effectiveness. The method was evaluated across multiple model families, including both encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, using various prompt types ranging from few-shot examples to open-ended generation tasks.

## Key Results
- Tense and aspect directions discovered via LDA are orthogonal and interpretable, enabling targeted steering of these grammatical features during generation
- Steering is more effective when applied to generated tokens rather than the prompt, and most effective just before the target verb
- Optimal steering strength varies by model and layer, with higher efficacy observed for tense steering compared to aspect steering
- Steering can cause side effects including topic shift and text degeneration, particularly at higher intervention strengths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The steering mechanism works because tense and aspect are represented as structured, orthogonal directions in the model's residual space. When steering interventions are applied to these directions, they shift the model's internal representation toward the target grammatical feature before the verb is generated. The effectiveness depends on applying the intervention at the right time (just before the target verb) and place (generated tokens rather than the prompt), when the model's attention and prediction mechanisms are actively processing the verb's context. The variation in optimal strength across models and layers reflects differences in how different architectures and depths represent and utilize these grammatical features.

## Foundational Learning

**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** - A statistical method for finding linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes. Why needed: To discover interpretable directions in high-dimensional residual space that correspond to grammatical features. Quick check: Verify that LDA directions maximize class separation and form orthogonal bases for tense and aspect.

**Residual Space Manipulation** - Adding scaled direction vectors to model activations during the forward pass. Why needed: To causally influence the model's internal representations and steer generation toward target features. Quick check: Confirm that steering vectors are added at the correct layer and token position relative to the target verb.

**Multi-Token Generation Context** - Generating sequences of multiple tokens rather than single-token predictions. Why needed: To evaluate steering in realistic generation scenarios where tense and aspect decisions occur dynamically. Quick check: Ensure evaluation metrics capture both grammatical feature control and overall generation quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Embeddings -> Transformer Layers -> Residual Space -> LDA Directions -> Steering Intervention -> Output Generation

**Critical Path**: The steering intervention must be applied at the correct layer and token position before the target verb is generated, with strength calibrated to the model's activation norms.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Steering strength vs. generation quality (higher strength improves feature control but risks side effects), intervention location (prompt vs. generated tokens), and timing (which token position relative to target verb).

**Failure Signatures**: Topic drift, text degeneration, or grammatical inconsistency when steering strength is too high; ineffective control when strength is too low or applied at wrong location/timing.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Vary steering strength systematically across models to find optimal values for tense and aspect control
2. Compare steering efficacy between few-shot and open-ended generation tasks
3. Test different intervention locations (prompt tokens vs. generated tokens) to validate optimal positioning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Steering efficacy varies significantly depending on prompt, task type, and steering strength
- Aspect control is less stable than tense control, though this may be due to fewer aspect classes rather than inherent properties
- Side effects like topic drift and degeneration occur, especially at higher steering strengths
- Generalizability to languages with richer tense-aspect systems remains untested

## Confidence

**High**: LDA-based discovery of interpretable tense/aspect directions, causal steering effects in multi-token generation

**Medium**: Stability differences between tense and aspect steering, practical robustness across diverse prompts and tasks, timing and location heuristics for steering

**Low**: Cross-linguistic generalizability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies across multiple syntactic positions to validate the timing heuristic for steering interventions
2. Test steering efficacy on languages with richer tense-aspect systems to assess cross-linguistic generalizability
3. Implement quantitative metrics for measuring side effects (e.g., topic drift, degeneration) across different steering strengths to establish safety thresholds
