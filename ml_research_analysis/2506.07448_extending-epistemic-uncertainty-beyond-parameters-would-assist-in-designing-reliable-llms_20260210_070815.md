# Extending Epistemic Uncertainty Beyond Parameters Would Assist in Designing Reliable LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07448
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: This paper advocates for Bayesian Modeling of Experiments (BME) as a coherent framework to systematically reason about and reduce uncertainty in large language model (LLM) deployments.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Bayesian Modeling of Experiments (BME) as a principled framework for understanding and reducing uncertainty in large language model (LLM) deployments. Unlike current approaches that focus on total uncertainty and passive rejection, BME distinguishes between reducible and irreducible uncertainty sources, enabling active interventions like clarification requests or information retrieval. The framework quantifies epistemic uncertainty through expected information gain and provides theoretical bounds for effective aleatoric uncertainty, potentially leading to more reliable and transparent LLM systems in high-stakes real-world settings.

## Method Summary
The authors propose BME as a framework that extends epistemic uncertainty beyond model parameters to include uncertainties from prompt selection, few-shot examples, and in-context learning configurations. BME treats uncertainty sources as latent variables in a probabilistic model, enabling systematic reasoning about reducibility. The framework quantifies epistemic uncertainty via expected information gain and offers methods for joint uncertainty management through conservative bounds on effective aleatoric uncertainty. While the theoretical foundation is established, practical implementation challenges remain, particularly around prior specification and handling latent uncertainty sources.

## Key Results
- BME enables systematic, context-specific steps to reduce uncertainty rather than passive rejection
- The framework quantifies epistemic uncertainty through expected information gain and provides theoretical bounds for effective aleatoric uncertainty
- BME is compatible with existing LLM practices and offers principled quantification of uncertainty sources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BME works by treating uncertainty as a property of the experimental design rather than just the model parameters. By modeling uncertainty sources as latent variables in a Bayesian framework, it enables reasoning about which uncertainties are reducible through active interventions. The expected information gain calculation quantifies the potential benefit of gathering additional information or changing experimental conditions. This mechanistic approach allows for targeted uncertainty reduction strategies that are context-specific rather than applying one-size-fits-all rejection thresholds.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian Modeling of Experiments (BME): A framework that treats uncertainty sources as latent variables to enable systematic reasoning about reducibility. Why needed: Current approaches conflate all uncertainty types and cannot distinguish between what can and cannot be reduced.
- Expected Information Gain: A quantification of how much uncertainty would decrease by running an experiment or gathering more information. Why needed: Provides a principled way to prioritize uncertainty reduction efforts.
- Effective Aleatoric Uncertainty: A conservative bound on irreducible uncertainty that accounts for epistemic uncertainty. Why needed: Enables more robust decision-making under uncertainty by not overestimating what can be known.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Experimental Design -> Latent Variables (Uncertainty Sources) -> Information Gain Calculation -> Uncertainty Reduction Strategy
- Critical Path: Define uncertainty sources → Specify priors → Calculate expected information gain → Implement reduction strategy
- Design Tradeoffs: Precision vs. computational cost in information gain calculations; specificity of uncertainty sources vs. model complexity
- Failure Signatures: Poor prior specification leading to misleading information gain values; conflation of uncertainty sources leading to ineffective reduction strategies
- First Experiments:
  1. Implement BME on a simple text classification task with controlled uncertainty sources
  2. Compare BME-guided uncertainty reduction against baseline rejection methods
  3. Validate theoretical bounds on effective aleatoric uncertainty in practice

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design or approximate unifying latent variables that capture the combined effects of multiple uncertainty sources (ambiguity, prompt templates, in-context examples) in real-world LLM deployments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "How can we design or approximate such unifying latent variables in real-world systems?" (Section 4.1)
- Why unresolved: The proposed idealized strategy of exhaustively optimizing across all factors becomes infeasible due to combinatorial complexity; the conditional independence assumption in the illustrative Bayes net is oversimplistic.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of tractable approximation methods or proxy variables that enable joint uncertainty reduction, validated through improved calibration or reduced hallucination rates in deployed systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can sources of uncertainty be identified or rejected a priori before committing resources to collect experimental configurations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 notes that "BME still requires a set of experimental configurations representing each candidate source" and "the ability to identify or reject potential sources of uncertainty before committing resources to collect the necessary data or stimuli is highly valuable."
- Why unresolved: Obtaining configurations can be costly (e.g., user clarification, web retrieval), and while high-quality simulators can sometimes help, they are not always available or reliable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Methods that can predict information gain potential before running experiments, or adaptations of fractional factorial design principles to sequence-valued LLM variables.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What trade-offs exist between interpretability, tractability, and uncertainty reduction when operationalizing BME-based bounds in practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "What trade-offs exist between interpretability, tractability, and uncertainty reduction? And to what extent can we operationalize these theoretical bounds to inform robust deployment decisions in practice?" (Section 4.1)
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes theoretical bounds for effective aleatoric uncertainty but does not implement or validate them in real systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different approximation strategies for the lower bound on effective aleatoric uncertainty, measuring their impact on abstention decisions and overall system reliability.

## Limitations
- The framework requires well-calibrated priors over model and input space, which are non-trivial to specify for large, opaque systems
- Treating all uncertainty as epistemic may conflate fundamentally different phenomena, particularly model structure versus data sparsity uncertainty
- It remains unclear how well BME scales to high-dimensional, latent uncertainty sources in real-world deployments

## Confidence
- BME provides a principled framework for uncertainty quantification: **High**
- BME enables systematic reduction of uncertainty: **Medium**
- BME is compatible with existing LLM practices: **High**
- Practical deployment of BME requires further methodological advances: **High**
- BME can improve real-world reliability and transparency: **Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a user study comparing LLM performance and user trust under BME-guided versus baseline uncertainty handling
2. Develop and evaluate methods for eliciting and validating priors over model and input space for BME
3. Test BME's scalability and effectiveness in identifying and mitigating uncertainty from latent variables in real-world datasets
