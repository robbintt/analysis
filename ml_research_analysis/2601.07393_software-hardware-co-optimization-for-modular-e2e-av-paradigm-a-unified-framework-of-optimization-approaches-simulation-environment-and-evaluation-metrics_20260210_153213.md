# Software-Hardware Co-optimization for Modular E2E AV Paradigm: A Unified Framework of Optimization Approaches, Simulation Environment and Evaluation Metrics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.07393
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07393
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Framework achieves >6× latency reduction, 5× energy savings, and 22.35% EERA V improvement while maintaining baseline accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a unified software-hardware co-optimization framework for modular end-to-end autonomous driving systems. The framework integrates module-wise pruning, quantization, and hardware-level optimizations under a system-level objective. A novel multidimensional evaluation metric, EERA V, jointly considers safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy consumption. Experimental results on multiple ME2E models demonstrate significant improvements in both performance and efficiency while maintaining baseline accuracy.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-pronged optimization approach: module-wise pruning to reduce model complexity, quantization to decrease computational precision requirements, and hardware-level optimizations targeting specific computational bottlenecks. These techniques are coordinated through a unified system-level objective function that balances multiple performance criteria. The evaluation uses a comprehensive simulation environment with the proposed EERA V metric, which integrates safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy consumption into a single unified score.

## Key Results
- Latency reduced by over 6× compared to baseline models
- Energy consumption decreased to one-fifth of baseline levels
- 22.35% improvement in EERA V metric while maintaining baseline accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The co-optimization approach works by simultaneously addressing software model complexity and hardware computational constraints. Module-wise pruning reduces redundant parameters without compromising critical decision-making capabilities. Quantization enables efficient computation on specialized hardware while maintaining sufficient precision for safety-critical decisions. Hardware optimizations exploit the specific characteristics of the target platform to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. The unified system-level objective ensures that optimizations in one domain don't negatively impact other critical performance metrics.

## Foundational Learning
- **ME2E (Modular End-to-End) architecture**: Why needed - enables task-specific optimization while maintaining end-to-end decision capabilities. Quick check - verify that each module can be independently optimized without breaking system integration.
- **Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics**: Why needed - single metrics like latency or accuracy are insufficient for autonomous driving safety. Quick check - ensure all five dimensions (safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, energy) are properly weighted and measured.
- **Software-hardware co-design**: Why needed - isolated optimizations miss opportunities for cross-domain improvements. Quick check - validate that hardware-aware software optimizations actually translate to measurable hardware performance gains.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Perception Module -> Decision Module -> Control Module -> Hardware Platform

**Critical Path**: Sensor data acquisition → Perception processing → Decision planning → Control execution → Actuator commands

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model accuracy vs. computational efficiency, safety vs. latency, energy consumption vs. performance, module independence vs. system-level coordination

**Failure Signatures**: Degradation in safety scores indicates perception or decision module failures; increased latency suggests hardware resource bottlenecks; energy spikes may indicate inefficient quantization or hardware utilization issues

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline performance measurement across all five EERA V dimensions
2. Individual module optimization impact assessment
3. End-to-end system integration testing with hardware-in-the-loop validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily based on simulation environments, not real-world conditions
- Generalizability across different driving scenarios and environmental conditions requires further validation
- Long-term performance stability and potential degradation over time are not fully characterized

## Confidence
| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Latency reduction and energy efficiency improvements | High |
| EERA V metric effectiveness | Medium |
| Real-world applicability and robustness | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct real-world road testing across diverse driving conditions (urban, highway, adverse weather) to validate simulation results and assess the framework's robustness in practical deployment scenarios.

2. Perform cross-model evaluation with different ME2E architectures and sensor configurations to verify the framework's generalizability and identify any architecture-specific limitations.

3. Implement long-term testing to evaluate the system's performance stability, potential degradation over time, and any emergent behaviors that may not be captured in short-term evaluations.
