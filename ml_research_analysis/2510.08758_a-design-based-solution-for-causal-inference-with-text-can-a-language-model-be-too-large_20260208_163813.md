# A Design-based Solution for Causal Inference with Text: Can a Language Model Be Too Large?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.08758
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08758
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: LLM-based causal estimators fail in text-as-treatment settings due to induced positivity violations, while simpler bag-of-words methods succeed

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of causal inference with text as treatment, specifically addressing latent confounding when linguistic properties affect outcomes. The authors identify a critical flaw in existing LLM-based methods: they risk encoding the treatment itself in learned representations, creating overlap bias that prevents valid causal estimation. To solve this, they introduce a novel experimental design where participants generate texts with varying levels of a treatment feature (intellectual humility), then edit these texts to change only the treatment while preserving all else. A separate group evaluates these texts. Their experiment with 6,994 evaluations of 1,830 unique political argument texts shows that LLM-based methods fail to estimate true treatment effects, while simpler bag-of-words models perform better. Substantively, they find that intellectually humble language reduces perceived aggression but also decreases perceived informativeness and persuasiveness.

## Method Summary
The authors developed an experimental design where writers generate texts with varying levels of intellectual humility (treatment T), editors modify these texts to flip the treatment while preserving all other content (confounders Z), and evaluators rate the outcomes. This creates matched pairs where Z(original) = Z(edited), allowing differencing to eliminate confounding. They benchmark various estimators including TextCause (LLM-based), TI estimator (Transformer-based), bag-of-words with inverse probability weighting, and weighted least squares with text-pair fixed effects. The weighted LS estimator with text-pair fixed effects achieved unbiased estimates in their experiment.

## Key Results
- LLM-based estimators (TextCause and TI) consistently estimate null effects due to induced positivity violations
- Bag-of-words models maintain better overlap and estimate true treatment effects accurately
- Intellectual humility reduces perceived aggression but also decreases perceived informativeness and persuasiveness
- Their weighted least squares estimator with text-pair fixed effects achieves unbiased ATE estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based text representations can induce positivity violations when treatment is a text component.
- Mechanism: Language models trained to predict treatment and outcome learn representations that encode the treatment itself into the embedding space. This forces treated and control units into distinct regions of the latent space, making propensity scores approach 0 or 1 and preventing valid counterfactual estimation.
- Core assumption: Treatment status is recoverable from text content, which causes the model to separate treatment groups in representation space.
- Evidence anchors: The TextCause algorithm encodes the treatment itself in the learned representations, thereby forcing a positivity violation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Human editing preserves confounders while isolating treatment variation.
- Mechanism: By having editors modify texts to change only the treatment feature while preserving all other content, the design ensures Z(original) = Z(edited). This makes treatment independent of confounders within matched pairs, allowing differencing to eliminate confounding.
- Core assumption: Editors can successfully preserve all non-treatment features during editing, and Z(W) is well-defined.
- Evidence anchors: As long as the edits have preserved everything except the treatment, the effect of all possible confounders Z will be differenced out.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Simpler text representations (bag-of-words) can capture confounding without inducing positivity violations in moderate-complexity settings.
- Mechanism: Sparse representations like BoW provide sufficient information to model confounding while maintaining overlap because individual word features don't perfectly predict treatment status. The lower dimensionality and interpretable structure prevent complete separation of treatment groups.
- Core assumption: Confounding information is recoverable from word-level features; treatment is not a simple deterministic function of individual words.
- Evidence anchors: The IPW estimates are consistently inside the true ATE bands, suggesting that simple text representations can effectively represent confounding information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Positivity/Overlap Assumption**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper's critique of LLM methods hinges on understanding why propensity scores near 0 or 1 prevent causal identification—you cannot estimate counterfactuals for units with no comparable matches.
  - Quick check question: If a language model produces representations where all treated texts cluster in one region and controls in another with no overlap, why does this violate the positivity assumption?

- Concept: **Latent Confounding in Text**
  - Why needed here: Text properties are interconnected; changing one feature (humility) often changes others (tone, word choice). Understanding this motivates the editing design.
  - Quick check question: Why can't you simply compare outcomes between naturally occurring humble vs. arrogant texts to estimate the causal effect of humility?

- Concept: **Potential Outcomes Framework with Text**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes τ_d (effect of documents with a feature) from τ_t (effect of the feature itself), which requires understanding nested potential outcomes Y(T(W), Z(W)).
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between τ_d and τ_t, and why does τ_t require holding Z constant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Writers -> Generate texts (T=0 or T=1, various Z) -> Editors -> Create matched pairs (same Z, flipped T) -> Evaluators -> Rate outcomes (Y: aggressive, informative, persuasive, etc.) -> Weighted LS Estimator -> τ̂_t = average within-pair outcome differences

- Critical path: Editor quality is the bottleneck. If edits fail to preserve Z, the entire identification strategy collapses. The 5.95% bad-edit removal rate indicates this is a real concern requiring audit mechanisms.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - BoW vs. LLM representations: BoW maintains overlap but may miss subtle confounders; LLMs capture complex features but risk positivity violations
  - Multiple edits per text: Increases sample size and enables confounding control but raises recruitment costs
  - Human editing vs. LLM editing: Human editing is auditable and natural; LLM editing is faster but relies on untestable assumptions

- Failure signatures:
  - TextCause returns near-zero ATEs regardless of true effect → check for induced positivity violations
  - TI estimator produces propensity scores clustered at 0 or 1 → representation encodes treatment
  - Weighted LS estimates differ substantially from difference-in-means on full sample → confounding present but handled by design

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate simulation on your own text data: filter by respectfulness ratings, compare BoW IPW vs. TI estimator ATEs against known ground truth
  2. Audit editing quality: Have independent evaluators rate whether edited texts preserve topic, argument structure, and non-treatment features. Calculate proportion of failed edits
  3. Test representation overlap: Train a classifier to predict treatment from LLM embeddings vs. BoW features. If accuracy approaches 100%, the representation encodes treatment and will induce positivity violations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can experimental designs be adapted to estimate the causal effects of linguistic properties in dynamic, interactive conversations rather than in isolated statements?
  - Basis in paper: The authors conclude that "Future work should develop designs capable of capturing the causal effects of communication in conversational contexts."
  - Why unresolved: The current design relies on editing static texts to isolate treatment, which does not capture the feedback loops and turn-taking inherent in conversation.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A novel experimental protocol where confederates or bots interact with participants using controlled linguistic features, allowing for the measurement of conversational outcomes.

- Question: How can the identification of LLM-induced positivity violations inform the development of robust estimators for observational text data where experimental manipulation is impossible?
  - Basis in paper: The authors note that "continued methodological innovation is needed to support retrospective causal inference with latent treatments for observational data analysis."
  - Why unresolved: Current LLM methods fail by encoding the treatment, while experimental solutions like this paper's require control over text generation unavailable in observational settings.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A new algorithm that successfully adjusts for confounding in observational text corpora without violating overlap, validated against the experimental ground truth provided in this paper.

- Question: Does the reduction in perceived persuasiveness of intellectually humble language persist in interactive dialogue, or does the accompanying reduction in aggression facilitate better engagement?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state, "it remains unclear how humble language influences outcomes in interactive, conversational settings."
  - Why unresolved: The current study finds IH reduces persuasiveness in static text, but it is unknown if this trade-off holds when the reader is actively engaged in a two-way exchange.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An experiment measuring persuasion and engagement outcomes in a live dialogue setting where participants interact with intellectually humble versus arrogant interlocutors.

## Limitations

- The experimental design requires significant human effort for writing and editing texts, limiting scalability
- The findings are based on a specific treatment feature (intellectual humility) in political argument contexts, which may not generalize to other linguistic properties or domains
- The paper focuses on binary treatment, while many text-based treatments are continuous or multi-valued

## Confidence

- **High**: The experimental design's validity for isolating treatment effects while controlling latent confounding; the empirical finding that LLM-based estimators fail while BoW methods succeed in their specific setting
- **Medium**: The claim that simpler representations can capture sufficient confounding information; the interpretation that intellectual humility reduces aggression but also perceived informativeness/persuasiveness
- **Low**: Generalizability of LLM failure to all text-as-treatment causal inference; whether editing quality can be maintained at scale for different treatment features

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain replication**: Apply the same experimental design and estimators to a different treatment feature (e.g., politeness, formality, or emotional tone) in a different domain (e.g., product reviews or customer service interactions) to test generalizability.

2. **Alternative LLM architectures**: Test whether different language model architectures (e.g., sparse models, smaller models, or models with explicit treatment constraints) can avoid the positivity violation while maintaining the advantages of learned representations.

3. **Editor quality audit**: Implement a blind evaluation where independent annotators assess whether edited texts preserve non-treatment features, measuring the actual failure rate and identifying patterns in unsuccessful edits to refine the methodology.
