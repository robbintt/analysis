core_contribution: This work addresses the lack of large-scale Slovak speech data
  for ASR by constructing SloPalSpeech, a 2.8k-hour dataset from parliamentary recordings,
  and fine-tuning Whisper models on it. The core method involves aligning long-form
  audio with transcripts using anchor-based timestamping, segmenting into 30-second
  clips, and fine-tuning models from Whisper-small to large-v3.

# SloPalSpeech: A 2,800-Hour Slovak Speech Corpus from Parliamentary Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.19270
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19270
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Constructed a 2,800-hour Slovak ASR corpus from parliamentary data and fine-tuned

## Method Summary
The paper constructed a 2,800-hour Slovak speech corpus from parliamentary data by automatically generating transcripts from metadata and then applying forced alignment to correct the transcripts. The data was sourced from Slovak parliamentary proceedings, which provides naturally diverse and domain-specific speech content. This approach leverages the structured nature of parliamentary records to create a large-scale dataset suitable for training Slovak automatic speech recognition systems.

## Key Results
The primary result is the creation of a 2,800-hour Slovak ASR corpus derived from parliamentary proceedings. While specific model performance metrics are not provided in the available information, the scale of the corpus itself represents a significant contribution to Slovak language resources for speech technology. The corpus is described as being fine-tuned for ASR applications, though exact benchmark results are not available in the current report.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
This approach works because parliamentary proceedings provide naturally occurring, domain-specific speech data with structured metadata. The automatic transcript generation from metadata combined with forced alignment creates a scalable pipeline for producing large speech datasets. The parliamentary domain offers diverse vocabulary and speaking styles while maintaining relatively clean speech conditions compared to other domains like conversational speech or environmental recordings.

## Foundational Learning
The methodology builds on established techniques in speech corpus construction, particularly the use of forced alignment for transcript correction. The approach leverages existing ASR tools and parliamentary data infrastructure to create a resource that addresses the scarcity of large-scale Slovak speech datasets. This work follows the pattern of creating language-specific speech resources through domain-specific data collection, similar to approaches used for other low-resource languages.

## Architecture Onboarding
The corpus is designed to be compatible with standard ASR architectures and training pipelines. Given its scale and format, it can be used with transformer-based models, RNN-based systems, or other acoustic model architectures commonly employed in speech recognition. The forced-aligned transcripts ensure high-quality training data suitable for supervised learning approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the available information. Potential areas for investigation could include the generalization of models trained on parliamentary data to other domains, the impact of the parliamentary domain on model bias, or the potential for expanding the corpus with additional data sources.

## Limitations
Unknown: Specific limitations of the corpus or methodology are not detailed in the available information. Potential limitations might include domain specificity affecting generalization, potential bias toward formal parliamentary language, or challenges in handling diverse speaker characteristics present in parliamentary recordings.

## Confidence
Medium: The report is based on the abstract and available information from the arXiv paper. While the core contribution of creating a large Slovak speech corpus is clear, specific technical details, performance metrics, and comprehensive analysis are not available in the current report.

## Next Checks
- Review the full paper for detailed methodology, performance metrics, and analysis
- Verify the availability and accessibility of the corpus for research purposes
- Examine the forced alignment approach and its accuracy in transcript correction
- Investigate the diversity of speakers and speaking conditions represented in the corpus
- Assess the potential domain bias and its implications for ASR applications beyond parliamentary contexts
