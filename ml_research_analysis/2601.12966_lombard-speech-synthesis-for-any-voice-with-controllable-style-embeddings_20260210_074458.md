# Lombard Speech Synthesis for Any Voice with Controllable Style Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.12966
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12966
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Zero-shot Lombard TTS with controllable style embeddings improves intelligibility under noise while preserving speaker identity.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a zero-shot Lombard speech synthesis method that manipulates style embeddings to control prosody without requiring Lombard training data. The approach uses PCA to identify style embedding components correlated with loudness and clarity, then shifts these components to synthesize speech at desired Lombard levels. The F5-TTS model is adapted with style embeddings extracted from reference audio and duration control. Evaluations show the method preserves speaker identity (SSIM ~81%), maintains naturalness (UTMOS ~3.5), and improves intelligibility under noise (relative WER reduction up to 50% at SNR=10). The system outperforms the baseline in cross-lingual settings and demonstrates that controlled style embedding manipulation enables robust, controllable Lombard TTS.

## Method Summary
The method builds on F5-TTS Base by adding FiLM conditioning to decoder DiT blocks using style embeddings from reference audio. A style encoder is trained on the Emilia dataset to extract 1024D embeddings from speech. During inference, PCA is applied to style embeddings from Lombard corpora (AVID for loudness, ALBA for clarity) to identify components that correlate with Lombard characteristics. These components are shifted according to desired Lombard levels (Soft, Normal, Loud, Very Loud) before inverse PCA and TTS generation. Duration control ensures appropriate Lombard speaking rate. The system achieves zero-shot Lombard synthesis for any speaker by manipulating style embeddings rather than training on Lombard data.

## Key Results
- Maintains speaker identity with SSIM ~81% across Lombardness levels
- Achieves naturalness scores of UTMOS ~3.5 comparable to ground truth
- Improves intelligibility under noise with relative WER reduction up to 50% at SNR=10
- Outperforms baseline in cross-lingual Lombard synthesis settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the F5-TTS model's existing conditioning capabilities with style embeddings. PCA identifies interpretable dimensions in the high-dimensional style space that correspond to Lombard characteristics like loudness and clarity. By shifting these components while preserving other aspects of the style embedding, the system can synthesize Lombard speech without requiring explicit Lombard training data. The FiLM conditioning allows the decoder to adapt its behavior based on the modified style embeddings, while duration control ensures appropriate speaking rate for Lombard speech. This approach separates the control of Lombard characteristics from speaker identity, enabling zero-shot adaptation.

## Foundational Learning

**F5-TTS Model Architecture**
- Why needed: Understanding the base model is essential since Lombard synthesis builds on its conditioning capabilities
- Quick check: Verify FiLM conditioning layers can be added to existing DiT blocks without architectural conflicts

**Style Embeddings**
- Why needed: Style embeddings capture speaker characteristics and speaking style from reference audio
- Quick check: Confirm 1024D embeddings from ECAPA-TDNN contain sufficient information for Lombard synthesis

**PCA for Style Analysis**
- Why needed: Reduces high-dimensional style space to interpretable components for controllable manipulation
- Quick check: Validate that PC1/PC2 correlate with loudness and clarity across multiple speakers

**FiLM Conditioning**
- Why needed: Enables dynamic adaptation of decoder behavior based on style embeddings
- Quick check: Ensure conditioning parameters properly scale and shift intermediate features

**Lombard Speech Characteristics**
- Why needed: Defines target synthesis behavior for noisy environment adaptation
- Quick check: Verify that shifted style embeddings produce expected Lombard prosody patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
F5-TTS Base -> FiLM Conditioning Layers -> Style Encoder -> PCA Analysis -> Lombard Control

**Critical Path**
Reference audio → Style embedding extraction → PCA projection → Component shifting → Inverse PCA → TTS generation with duration control

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Zero-shot approach vs. training on Lombard data (flexibility vs. potential quality loss)
- Style embedding manipulation vs. explicit Lombard prosody modeling (simplicity vs. controllability)
- FiLM conditioning vs. full fine-tuning (parameter efficiency vs. adaptation capacity)

**Failure Signatures**
- Speaker identity degradation when shifting components too aggressively
- Unnatural prosody when loudness and clarity controls are imbalanced
- Reduced intelligibility if duration control parameters are incorrect

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test baseline F5-TTS with style embeddings without component shifting
2. Validate PCA identifies loudness/clarity components using AVID/ALBA data
3. Compare WER improvements under noise for different Lombard levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- FiLM conditioning implementation details are underspecified, creating ambiguity in reproduction
- Formant shift augmentation parameters are not detailed, potentially affecting style embedding quality
- Cross-lingual Lombard TTS is demonstrated only qualitatively without quantitative metrics
- Extreme Lombardness settings may degrade speaker identity beyond reported levels

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters and confidence labels:**
- Lombard synthesis feasibility: High
- Zero-shot speaker adaptation: Medium
- Cross-lingual Lombard TTS: Low

## Next Checks
1. **FiLM conditioning ablation study:** Remove FiLM layers and compare WER, SSIM, and UTMOS to confirm conditioning is essential for Lombard synthesis quality.
2. **Formant augmentation sensitivity:** Train models with and without formant shifts and measure downstream style embedding quality and Lombard synthesis performance.
3. **Extreme Lombardness stress test:** Generate Very Loud samples across multiple speakers and measure SSIM and subjective intelligibility to quantify speaker identity trade-offs.
