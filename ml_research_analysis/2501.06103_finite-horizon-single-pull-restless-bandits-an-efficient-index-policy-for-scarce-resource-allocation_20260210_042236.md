# Finite-Horizon Single-Pull Restless Bandits: An Efficient Index Policy For Scarce Resource Allocation

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06103
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces a novel single-pull constraint for restless bandits with sub-linear optimality gap guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Finite-Horizon Single-Pull Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (SPRMABs), a variant where each arm can be pulled only once, creating additional complexity compared to standard RMABs. The authors propose a novel transformation using dummy states to expand the system, ensuring arms transition exclusively within dummy states once activated. Based on this transformation, they develop the Single-Pull Index (SPI) policy, which achieves sub-linearly decaying average optimality gap of O(1/√ρ + 1/ρ^(3/2)) for finite arms where ρ is the scaling factor. Extensive simulations validate the method across various domains, demonstrating robust performance compared to existing benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors address the single-pull constraint in restless bandits by introducing dummy states that duplicate the original system. When an arm is activated, it transitions exclusively within these dummy states, preventing further activations. This transformation allows the application of index policies while respecting the single-pull constraint. The SPI policy is then derived from this expanded system, providing a lightweight solution that maintains theoretical performance guarantees. The approach is particularly valuable for resource allocation problems where arms represent scarce resources that can only be utilized once.

## Key Results
- Achieves sub-linearly decaying average optimality gap of O(1/√ρ + 1/ρ^(3/2))
- SPI policy demonstrates robust performance across multiple domain simulations
- Novel dummy state transformation enables index policy application to single-pull constraints
- Provides theoretical guarantees for finite-arm settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The single-pull constraint fundamentally changes the RMAB structure by limiting each arm to one activation. The dummy state transformation creates a new system where activated arms transition within a separate state space, effectively removing them from consideration for future pulls. This allows the application of index policies that rely on comparing marginal values of activation. The SPI policy then leverages this transformed system to make allocation decisions while maintaining theoretical performance bounds. The sub-linear gap arises from the careful balance between exploration and exploitation in this constrained setting.

## Foundational Learning
- Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs): Sequential decision-making framework with multiple independent Markov decision processes (why needed: core problem setting; quick check: understand state transitions and reward structures)
- Index Policies: Whittle's approach to RMABs where arms are prioritized based on computed indices (why needed: basis for SPI policy; quick check: verify index monotonicity properties)
- Single-Pull Constraint: Each arm can only be activated once in the horizon (why needed: defines the novel problem variant; quick check: ensure dummy state transformation correctly enforces constraint)
- Dummy State Transformation: Expanding state space to handle single-pull constraint (why needed: enables index policy application; quick check: verify transition probabilities in expanded system)
- Sub-linear Optimality Gap: Performance bound that improves with problem scaling (why needed: theoretical guarantee of SPI policy; quick check: confirm gap bounds hold across different ρ values)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Original RMAB states -> Dummy states expansion -> SPI policy computation -> Resource allocation decisions

Critical Path: State expansion (dummy states) → Index computation (SPI) → Allocation decision → Performance evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: The dummy state expansion increases state space complexity but enables efficient index-based solutions. Alternative approaches might use constraint programming but would be computationally expensive.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance when ρ is small (violating asymptotic assumptions), degraded results with highly correlated arm dynamics, suboptimal behavior with non-standard reward structures.

First Experiments:
1. Test SPI policy on a simple two-arm RMAB with known optimal solution to verify basic correctness
2. Compare SPI performance against Whittle index policy on standard RMAB benchmarks to quantify single-pull constraint impact
3. Evaluate scaling behavior by running experiments across different ρ values to verify sub-linear gap predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are asymptotic and require sufficiently large ρ values
- Dummy state transformation correctness needs verification for arbitrary MDP structures
- Empirical evaluation limited to specific problem instances may not generalize to all restless bandit scenarios
- Method's applicability to other RMAB variants beyond single-pull constraints remains unclear

## Confidence

Theoretical Claims: Medium
- Sub-linear gap bounds depend on asymptotic behavior
- Dummy state transformation needs broader verification

Empirical Results: Medium-High
- Multiple domain tests conducted
- Limited to specific problem instances

Overall Contribution: High
- Novel single-pull constraint addressed
- SPI policy provides practical solution

## Next Checks

1. Test the SPI policy on a broader set of benchmark RMAB problems with varying transition dynamics and reward structures to assess robustness

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the performance impact of dummy states versus alternative state expansion methods

3. Verify the theoretical gap bounds through systematic experiments across different ρ values and arm cluster configurations to confirm the scaling behavior matches predictions
