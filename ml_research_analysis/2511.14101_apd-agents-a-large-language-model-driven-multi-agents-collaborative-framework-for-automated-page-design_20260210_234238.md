# APD-Agents: A Large Language Model-Driven Multi-Agents Collaborative Framework for Automated Page Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.14101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14101
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Multi-agent LLM framework achieving 0.485 IoU and 85.90% Element Properties Accuracy on mobile UI layout generation

## Executive Summary
APD-Agents introduces a novel multi-agent framework that leverages large language models to automate mobile app page design from natural language descriptions. The system employs specialized agents working collaboratively to interpret user requirements, retrieve design exemplars, generate initial layouts, and recursively refine components into structured JSON outputs compatible with design tools like Sketch and Figma. Experiments on the RICO dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing layout generation methods in both spatial accuracy and element property preservation.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a hierarchical generation strategy using five specialized agents orchestrated through AutoGen. The process begins with the OrchestratorAgent managing workflow and the SemanticParserAgent translating natural language into structured design specifications. The TemplateRetrievalAgent uses GLM embedding v2 to find relevant design exemplars from the RICO dataset, while the PrimaryLayoutAgent generates first-layer layouts based on these exemplars and specifications. Finally, the RecursiveComponentAgent performs depth-first refinement of individual components. The system outputs structured JSON with layout attributes including class, name, frame coordinates, and styling information, designed for direct import into professional design software.

## Key Results
- Achieved maximum IoU of 0.485 and Element Properties Accuracy of 85.90% on RICO dataset
- Outperformed existing layout generation methods across multiple evaluation metrics
- Demonstrated effective coarse-to-fine generation strategy reducing token limit issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hierarchical generation strategy enables effective management of complex design tasks by breaking them into manageable subtasks. The multi-agent collaboration allows specialized processing at each stage - from natural language understanding to spatial layout generation and fine-grained component refinement. The use of design exemplars through retrieval provides concrete references that ground the generation process in real-world design patterns, while the recursive refinement ensures detailed accuracy in the final output.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent collaboration patterns**: Why needed - enables specialized processing for different aspects of design generation; Quick check - verify agent specialization through task decomposition analysis
- **Hierarchical layout generation**: Why needed - manages complexity of mobile UI design through progressive refinement; Quick check - validate generation quality at each hierarchy level
- **Design exemplar retrieval**: Why needed - grounds generation in real-world design patterns; Quick check - measure retrieval relevance and coverage
- **Structured JSON output schema**: Why needed - ensures compatibility with professional design tools; Quick check - validate import functionality in Sketch/Figma

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Description -> SemanticParserAgent -> TemplateRetrievalAgent -> PrimaryLayoutAgent -> RecursiveComponentAgent -> Structured JSON Output

**Critical Path**: NL Input → Semantic Parsing → Exemplar Retrieval → First-layer Layout → Recursive Refinement → JSON Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes editability and professional tool compatibility over image-based generation, sacrificing some generation speed for structured, modifiable outputs. The coarse-to-fine approach trades computational efficiency for accuracy in complex layouts.

**Failure Signatures**: Generation failures occur primarily due to token limits (18% reported failure rate), style mismatches from limited reference coverage, and potential inconsistencies in hierarchical path resolution during retrieval.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Validate the SemanticParserAgent's ability to accurately extract design specifications from diverse natural language descriptions
2. Test the TemplateRetrievalAgent's effectiveness using substitute embedding models while maintaining retrieval quality
3. Evaluate the RecursiveComponentAgent's refinement quality on simple layouts before scaling to complex designs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dependency on specific model APIs (GLM embedding v2, Doubao-1.5-pro-32k) that may not be publicly accessible
- 18% failure rate for one-go generation indicates inherent limitations in the coarse-to-fine approach
- Evaluation focused on RICO dataset screenshots may not generalize to all mobile app design scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Multi-agent framework architecture and quantitative improvements over baselines are well-documented
- **Medium Confidence**: Hierarchical generation strategy effectiveness is plausible but would benefit from additional ablation studies
- **Low Confidence**: Exact impact of specific model versions cannot be determined without API access

## Next Checks
1. Implement the RICO dataset preprocessing pipeline to create the hierarchical JSON schema with deduplicated elements and design specifications, then verify the retrieval mechanism using accessible embedding models
2. Conduct an ablation study comparing the multi-agent approach against single-agent generation and against the paper's reported results when using substitute models
3. Perform cross-dataset validation by testing the framework on mobile UI layouts outside the RICO dataset to assess generalization capabilities beyond the reported domain
