# DIVERGE: Diversity-Enhanced RAG for Open-Ended Information Seeking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00238
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00238
- Reference count: 40
- Improves semantic diversity by ~2.5× and viewpoint diversity by ~1.6× vs. direct prompting while maintaining quality

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating diverse responses in open-ended information-seeking tasks, where standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems tend to produce homogenized outputs despite having access to diverse retrieved contexts. To overcome this, the authors propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework that explicitly models diverse viewpoints through reflection-guided generation, viewpoint-aware retrieval, and iterative refinement. Evaluated on the Infinity-Chat dataset, DIVERGE achieves the best diversity-quality trade-off among competitive baselines.

## Method Summary
DIVERGE is an iterative agentic RAG framework that generates diverse responses by explicitly modeling multiple viewpoints. The system starts with an initial RAG response, then iteratively reflects on previously explored viewpoints to generate new, insufficiently covered perspectives. It uses memory-aware maximal marginal relevance (MMR) retrieval that considers both relevance and diversity across all retrieved documents, and conditions generation on both the original query and the targeted viewpoint. The framework employs a refinement step to ensure alignment with the original query and coherent logical structure.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~2.5× improvement in semantic diversity compared to direct prompting
- Achieves ~1.6× improvement in viewpoint diversity compared to direct prompting
- Maintains comparable answer quality while achieving best diversity-quality trade-off among baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Reflection-guided viewpoint generation mitigates single-answer bias by explicitly surfacing latent perspectives. After initial RAG response, the LLM summarizes extracted viewpoints into memory. At each iteration, the model reflects on prior outputs to generate new, insufficiently covered viewpoints, forcing exploration beyond dominant response trajectories.
- Core assumption: LLMs contain multiple latent reasoning paths that can be selectively activated through appropriate prompting.
- Break condition: If reflection prompts produce redundant viewpoints (high semantic similarity to memory), the mechanism degrades to repeated generation.

### Mechanism 2
- Iteration-aware MMR retrieval prevents evidence redundancy across generations. The scoring function s_t(d) = α·Rel(d, q_t) − β·max_{h∈M<t} Sim(d, h) − (1−α)·max_{s∈S_t} Sim(d, s) penalizes similarity to both intra-iteration candidates and all previously retrieved documents stored in memory.
- Core assumption: Diversity at retrieval time propagates to diversity at generation time when combined with viewpoint conditioning.
- Break condition: If β is too low, retrieval collapses to relevance-only; if too high, retrieval may return irrelevant documents.

### Mechanism 3
- Viewpoint-conditioned generation anchors each response to a distinct perspective while maintaining query relevance. Generation is conditioned on (original query, targeted viewpoint, retrieved documents), with refinement ensuring alignment with the original query and coherent logical structure.
- Core assumption: Explicit viewpoint conditioning can override the LLM's default homogenized generation regime.
- Break condition: If viewpoint selection drifts from user intent, quality degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)**
  - Why needed here: Core retrieval reranking mechanism; understanding the relevance-diversity trade-off is essential for tuning α and β.
  - Quick check question: Given a set of retrieved documents, how would increasing β affect the final selected subset?

- **LLM Homogenization / Mode Collapse**
  - Why needed here: The fundamental problem DIVERGE addresses; post-training objectives sharpen output distributions toward dominant responses.
  - Quick check question: Why does increasing temperature alone fail to address homogenization when the underlying distribution is collapsed?

- **Harmonic Mean for Trade-off Metrics**
  - Why needed here: The Unified Score uses harmonic mean to penalize extreme imbalances between diversity and quality.
  - Quick check question: If quality = 0.9 and diversity = 0.3, would arithmetic or harmonic mean better reflect the trade-off failure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Memory Module -> Viewpoint Generator -> Query Generator -> Web Search + Reranker -> Viewpoint-Conditioned Generator
- Critical path:
  1. Initial retrieval → generation → viewpoint extraction (t=0)
  2. For t=1 to K: reflect → new viewpoint → query reformulation → history-aware retrieval → viewpoint-conditioned generation → memory update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - α=0.7, β=0.2 (paper defaults): Favor relevance; may under-explore in highly homogeneous domains
  - K=10 generations: Higher K increases diversity but also latency and cost
  - Chunk size 512 tokens / overlap 50: Standard; larger chunks may lose granularity
- Failure signatures:
  - Viewpoint drift: Selected viewpoints too broad/narrow → 40% of low-quality cases
  - Generic responses: Overly generic recommendations lacking specificity → 30% of failures
  - Narrow focus: Over-emphasis on peripheral aspects → 17% of failures
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation by component: Disable reflection (use random viewpoints), then disable memory-aware MMR (set β=0), measure impact on Unified Score vs. full DIVERGE.
  2. β sensitivity sweep: Run β ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5} on a held-out subset; plot diversity vs. quality curves to find domain-optimal settings.
  3. Viewpoint quality audit: Manually inspect 20 queries; compare generated viewpoints against human-identified perspectives to quantify viewpoint relevance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can generation systems achieve finer-grained control over viewpoint selection to prevent responses from diverging from user intent or focusing on overly narrow details?
  - Basis: Section 6.5 states that failure analysis highlights an important direction for "developing finer-grained control over viewpoint selection and integration."
  - Why unresolved: Current reflection mechanisms occasionally select viewpoints that are too broad, narrow, or irrelevant to the user's primary intent.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified selection algorithm that reduces error rates in the "diverting intent" (40%) and "too narrow" (17%) categories identified in the failure analysis.

- Which automated diversity metrics most accurately align with human perception in open-ended information seeking?
  - Basis: Appendix G notes, "it remains unclear which diversity metrics best align with human perception."
  - Why unresolved: The study relied on automated semantic and viewpoint diversity scores but did not validate these specific metrics against human diversity preferences.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A study correlating automated diversity scores (semantic and viewpoint) with human rankings of response variety.

- How can evaluation frameworks improve quality assessment for open-ended questions beyond current LLM-as-a-judge capabilities?
  - Basis: The authors acknowledge in Appendix G that "LLM-as-a-judge evaluations may not always provide perfectly accurate quality assessments."
  - Why unresolved: Evaluating open-ended knowledge-seeking tasks is inherently difficult, and current automated judges may miss nuances that human experts catch.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A new evaluation protocol demonstrating higher agreement with human expert judgments than the LLM-as-a-judge baseline.

## Limitations

- Evaluation confined to open-ended queries from Infinity-Chat dataset, limiting generalizability to other information-seeking tasks
- Reliance on GPT-5.x models (future at time of writing) introduces potential reproducibility gaps with current GPT-4/4o models
- Unified Score's harmonic mean formulation may obscure meaningful trade-offs in scenarios where either diversity or quality is inherently more valuable

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core architectural claims (reflection-guided viewpoint generation, memory-aware MMR retrieval, viewpoint-conditioned generation) are well-supported by ablation studies and component-level analysis.
- **Medium confidence**: The ~2.5× semantic diversity and ~1.6× viewpoint diversity improvements are specific to the Infinity-Chat dataset and may not transfer directly to other domains without recalibration of α, β, and τ parameters.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim of "best diversity–quality trade-off" among baselines is constrained by the specific baselines chosen and may shift with alternative competitive methods.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Transfer Validation**: Apply DIVERGE to a held-out subset of open-ended queries from a different dataset (e.g., HotpotQA or TREC-DL) to test whether the ~2.5× semantic diversity improvement holds outside Infinity-Chat.

2. **Component Robustness Sweep**: Systematically vary α ∈ {0.5, 0.7, 0.9} and β ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3} across multiple query categories to identify whether the chosen defaults are universally optimal or domain-specific.

3. **Manual Viewpoint Audit**: Conduct a blinded human evaluation of 50 DIVERGE-generated viewpoints versus 50 baseline (Direct Prompting) viewpoints to verify that increased viewpoint diversity corresponds to meaningfully distinct perspectives rather than superficial lexical variation.
