# Emotional Cognitive Modeling Framework with Desire-Driven Objective Optimization for LLM-empowered Agent in Social Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13195
- Reference count: 37
- LLM agents with emotional cognitive modeling show improved ecological validity in social simulations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating emotional cognition into large language model (LLM)-based agents for social simulation, as current agents lack the bounded rationality and emotional decision-making essential for realistic human-like behavior. The authors propose an emotional cognitive modeling framework that integrates desire generation and objective management, enabling agents to dynamically generate desires based on state changes and optimize objectives accordingly. The framework was implemented in a proprietary multi-agent interaction environment simulating an online food delivery ecosystem. Experimental results demonstrate that agents governed by the proposed framework exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states and generate decision outcomes that more closely approximate human behavioral patterns compared to rule-based, imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and GPT-4o-driven agents.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates desire generation with objective management to create emotionally driven decision-making in LLM agents. The system dynamically generates desires based on environmental state changes and agent internal states, then optimizes objectives accordingly. The framework was implemented within a proprietary multi-agent environment simulating an online food delivery ecosystem, where agents interact with each other and the environment while exhibiting emotionally influenced behaviors.

## Key Results
- Agents using the proposed framework showed superior ecological validity compared to rule-based, imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and GPT-4o-driven agents
- Mixed agent simulations achieved a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity score of 265.08, outperforming reinforcement learning (274.24) and GPT-4o (326.29) agents
- Framework-driven agents exhibited behaviors more congruent with their emotional states and generated emergence phenomena more consistent with real-world social systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its integration of desire generation with emotional cognitive modeling, which creates a more realistic bounded rationality model. By allowing agents to dynamically generate desires based on state changes rather than following predetermined rules, the system mimics human-like decision-making processes where emotions and internal states influence choices. This approach bridges the gap between pure rational optimization and the messy, context-dependent nature of human behavior.

## Foundational Learning
- **Desire Generation**: Creating internal motivations based on environmental and internal state changes; needed to enable context-dependent behavior rather than rigid rule-following; quick check: verify desires emerge appropriately from state transitions
- **Emotional Cognitive Modeling**: Mapping emotional states to decision-making processes; needed to capture the bounded rationality of human behavior; quick check: ensure emotional states correlate with behavioral patterns
- **Objective Management**: Dynamically optimizing goals based on current desires and constraints; needed to balance competing motivations; quick check: validate objective trade-offs produce realistic behavior

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Desire Generator -> Emotional State Model -> Objective Optimizer -> Decision Executor

**Critical Path:** State Change Detection → Desire Generation → Emotional State Update → Objective Optimization → Action Selection → Environment Interaction

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances computational complexity against behavioral realism by using desire generation rather than full emotional simulation, trading some emotional nuance for scalability and interpretability.

**Failure Signatures:** Agents may exhibit unrealistic behavior when desire generation fails to capture appropriate motivations, when emotional states don't properly influence objectives, or when the optimization process produces actions inconsistent with the current emotional context.

**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Test desire generation response to controlled state changes, 2) Validate emotional state transitions match expected patterns, 3) Compare objective optimization outcomes under different emotional states.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary multi-agent simulation environment prevents independent validation of performance claims
- Dynamic Time Warping similarity scores lack detailed methodological description for proper interpretation
- Framework's reliance on desire generation mechanisms raises scalability and computational efficiency concerns in larger social simulations

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The conceptual framework combining desire generation with emotional cognitive modeling is well-articulated and addresses a recognized gap in LLM agent development

**Medium confidence:** The experimental results showing improved ecological validity are plausible given the framework's design, but the proprietary environment and limited methodological detail prevent stronger validation

**Low confidence:** The specific performance metrics and their interpretation, particularly the DTW scores, require independent verification

## Next Checks
1. Implement the framework in an open-source multi-agent simulation environment to enable independent replication and comparison against alternative approaches
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of emotional cognitive modeling from other framework components in generating the observed behavioral patterns
3. Perform human evaluation studies where participants judge whether agent behaviors in the simulation appear more or less human-like compared to baseline approaches
