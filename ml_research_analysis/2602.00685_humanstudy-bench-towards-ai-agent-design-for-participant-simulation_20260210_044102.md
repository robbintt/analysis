core_contribution: The paper introduces HUMANSTUDY-BENCH, a benchmark and execution
  engine for evaluating AI agent designs as simulated participants in social science
  experiments. The approach treats participant simulation as an agent-design problem,
  where each agent is defined by a base model and a specification (e.g., demographic
  attributes, backstories) that encodes behavioral assumptions.

# HumanStudy-Bench: Towards AI Agent Design for Participant Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.00685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00685
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLM-based agents achieve limited and inconsistent alignment with human behavior in social science experiments, with demographic conditioning helping but rich backstories sometimes degrading performance

## Executive Summary
HUMANSTUDY-BENCH introduces a benchmark and execution engine for evaluating AI agent designs as simulated participants in social science experiments. The approach frames participant simulation as an agent-design problem, where agents are defined by base models and specifications that encode behavioral assumptions. The benchmark reconstructs 12 full human-subject experiments and provides controlled comparisons across models and designs. Results show current LLM agents exhibit polarized, bimodal responses rather than human-like patterns, with agent design having large non-monotonic effects on performance.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates AI agent designs by reconstructing full social science experiments from published studies and running LLM agents through the same protocols. The pipeline consists of four stages: Filter (LLM agent verifies paper completeness and feasibility), Extract (LLM converts papers to machine-readable schema), Execute (configuration agent generates study-specific configs and runs agents), and Evaluate (evaluator agent generates statistical analysis code). Agents are tested across 10 models with 4 specifications: blank, role-play, demographics, and contextualized backstories. Alignment is measured using Probability Alignment Score (PAS) for inferential agreement and Effect Consistency Score (ECS) for effect size fidelity.

## Key Results
- Current LLM agents achieve limited and inconsistent alignment with human behavior, showing bimodal response distributions rather than human-like patterns
- Demographic conditioning improves alignment while rich backstories sometimes degrade performance, revealing non-monotonic specification effects
- Neither larger models nor simple multi-model ensembles reliably improve alignment
- Safety refusal rates drop from 4.8% (blank agents) to 0.3% (backstory agents)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Agent-Design Problem Framing
Treating participant simulation as an agent-design problem (base model + specification) disentangles raw model capability from behavioral instantiation effects. By holding the base model fixed while varying specifications, it isolates how prompt-based behavioral assumptions affect replication fidelity rather than conflating model quality with agent setup.

### Mechanism 2: Probability Alignment Score (PAS)
PAS provides continuous, uncertainty-aware measurement of inferential agreement that avoids threshold instability of binary significance comparisons. It transforms test statistics into likelihood ratios, normalizes via sigmoid to get posterior probabilities, and captures the probability that both human and agent infer the same hypothesis.

### Mechanism 3: Specification Effects on Alignment
Demographic conditioning improves alignment by providing population-level statistical priors, but rich backstories introduce non-monotonic effects that can degrade performance. Models can condition on demographic priors but struggle with the implicit priors embedded in naturalistic backstories.

## Foundational Learning

- **Bayes Factor / Likelihood Ratio for hypothesis testing**: PAS relies on transforming test statistics into likelihood ratios before computing posteriors. Understanding BF interpretation is essential.
  *Quick check*: If Λ = 3 for an agent test and Λ = 10 for the human baseline, what are the corresponding posterior probabilities under neutral priors?

- **Agent specification vs. base model capability**: The core experimental manipulation varies specification while holding models fixed. Engineers must understand that prompt design is a first-class variable.
  *Quick check*: Why might the same base model produce bimodal vs. unimodal response distributions under different specifications?

- **Study-balanced aggregation**: The benchmark uses unweighted means across studies to prevent high-power studies from dominating, unlike meta-analysis.
  *Quick check*: If Study A has n=2000 and Study B has n=50, why should they contribute equally to the benchmark score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Filter Stage (LLM agent) -> Extract Stage (LLM agent) -> Execute Stage (configuration agent + runtime) -> Evaluate Stage (evaluator agent + scoring module)
- **Critical path**: Filter → Extract → Execute → Evaluate, with human review checkpoints after Filter and Extract for quality control
- **Design tradeoffs**: Reconstructed aggregate targets vs. individual-level data; PAS vs. ECS for different alignment aspects; temperature=1.0 for behavioral variance
- **Failure signatures**: Bimodal PAS distribution; PAS-ECS divergence; mixed-model baseline failure; safety refusal patterns
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce A1 vs. A3 comparison on a single study to confirm demographic conditioning improves PAS
  2. Run temperature sweep (0.1, 0.5, 1.0) on one model/study pair to verify null result on temperature effects
  3. Add a new study to the benchmark using the full pipeline to validate extraction and evaluation generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Non-monotonic effects of agent specifications suggest specification design may be highly model-dependent
- Evaluation relies on reconstructed aggregate targets rather than individual-level human data
- PAS metric depends on prior choices that could influence rankings despite sensitivity analysis

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Current LLM agents achieve limited and inconsistent alignment with human behavior (bimodal PAS distributions)
- **Medium confidence**: Agent design has large, non-monotonic effects on performance due to model-specific interactions
- **Medium confidence**: PAS metric's superiority over binary significance comparisons, though real-world validity needs further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-model specification stability**: Test whether backstory degradation persists across different instruction-tuned versions of the same base model
2. **Individual-level validation**: Compare PAS/ECS scores computed on aggregated vs. individual-level targets when raw data becomes available
3. **Out-of-distribution study test**: Apply the pipeline to a social science study from a different domain to assess generalization of specification design principles
