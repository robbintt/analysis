# Progressive Document-level Text Simplification via Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.03857
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03857
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a progressive simplification method (ProgDS) for long document-level text simplification using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ProgDS, a novel approach for document-level text simplification that leverages Large Language Models through a hierarchical decomposition strategy. The method addresses the challenge of simplifying long documents by breaking down the task into discourse-level, topic-level, and lexical-level simplification stages, mimicking human editorial processes. ProgDS significantly outperforms existing models and direct LLM prompting on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling with longer documents. The approach demonstrates the potential of combining hierarchical task decomposition with LLMs for complex natural language processing tasks.

## Method Summary
ProgDS employs a three-stage hierarchical approach to document-level text simplification. First, it performs discourse-level simplification to identify and reorganize the overall structure of the document. Next, it conducts topic-level simplification to refine and simplify content within each identified topic. Finally, it applies lexical-level simplification to simplify individual words and phrases. This progressive approach allows for more manageable simplification tasks at each level, leveraging the strengths of LLMs while mitigating their limitations with long documents. The method also incorporates iterative simplification to further enhance the quality of the generated text.

## Key Results
- ProgDS significantly outperforms existing smaller models and direct LLM prompting on Wiki-auto and Newsela datasets.
- The benefits of ProgDS are particularly pronounced when dealing with longer original documents.
- Iterative simplification further enhances the quality of the generated text.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ProgDS works by decomposing the complex task of document-level text simplification into more manageable subtasks. This hierarchical approach allows LLMs to focus on specific aspects of simplification at each level, reducing the cognitive load and improving the quality of the output. By mimicking human editorial processes, ProgDS can maintain coherence and context while simplifying content. The iterative nature of the approach allows for refinement and improvement of the simplified text, addressing potential issues that may arise from the simplification process.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Document-level text simplification**: Why needed - To make complex documents accessible to a wider audience, including those with reading difficulties or language learners.
   Quick check - Ability to simplify entire documents while maintaining coherence and readability.

2. **Hierarchical task decomposition**: Why needed - To break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks, improving performance and efficiency.
   Quick check - Effective division of the simplification task into discourse, topic, and lexical levels.

3. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Why needed - To leverage the advanced language understanding and generation capabilities of modern AI models.
   Quick check - Integration of LLMs in each stage of the simplification process.

4. **Iterative refinement**: Why needed - To improve the quality of generated text through multiple rounds of simplification.
   Quick check - Implementation of iterative simplification steps and their impact on output quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Original Document -> Discourse-level Simplification -> Topic-level Simplification -> Lexical-level Simplification -> Simplified Document

Critical Path:
The critical path in ProgDS involves the sequential execution of the three simplification stages. Each stage builds upon the output of the previous one, with the discourse-level simplification providing the overall structure, topic-level simplification refining content within topics, and lexical-level simplification addressing word and phrase-level changes.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Complexity vs. Quality: The hierarchical approach adds complexity but significantly improves simplification quality, especially for longer documents.
- Computational Cost vs. Performance: While iterative simplification improves results, it also increases computational requirements.

Failure Signatures:
- Loss of document coherence if discourse-level simplification fails to maintain the overall structure.
- Topic inconsistencies if topic-level simplification does not properly handle transitions between topics.
- Awkward phrasing or loss of meaning if lexical-level simplification oversimplifies or misinterprets context.

First Experiments:
1. Compare ProgDS with direct LLM prompting on a small subset of documents to demonstrate the benefits of hierarchical decomposition.
2. Evaluate the impact of each simplification stage by removing one level at a time and measuring the effect on output quality.
3. Test the iterative simplification process by varying the number of iterations and analyzing the trade-off between quality improvement and computational cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses on specific datasets (Wiki-auto and Newsela), which may limit generalizability to other domains or languages.
- The study does not address potential biases in the LLMs used, which could affect simplification quality for different types of content or writing styles.
- The computational costs associated with the hierarchical decomposition approach are not thoroughly discussed, which is relevant for practical deployment.

## Confidence
High
- The methodology of hierarchical decomposition for text simplification is clearly explained and logically structured.
- The experimental setup and results are well-documented, supporting the claims of improved performance.

Medium
- The generalization of the approach to other domains or languages is suggested but not empirically validated.
- The discussion on computational costs and practical deployment considerations is limited.

Low
- The potential impact of LLM biases on the simplification quality is acknowledged but not explored in depth.
- The trade-offs between simplification iterations and quality gains are mentioned but not thoroughly analyzed.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ProgDS on additional datasets from different domains or languages to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct a detailed analysis of computational costs and scalability for large-scale deployment.
3. Investigate the impact of LLM biases on simplification quality across diverse content types and writing styles.
