- Introduces LC-Eval, a bilingual multi-task benchmark for long-context understanding in English and Arabic across 4K-128K tokens

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LC-Eval, a bilingual multi-task benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding in English and Arabic. It features four novel tasks—multi-document QA, bilingual QA, claim verification, and MCQs—spanning context lengths from 4K to over 128K tokens. A custom entity-relationship-based evaluation method is proposed to better assess semantic understanding in open-ended responses. Experiments on open-weight and closed LLMs (including GPT-4o, Llama-3, Qwen2.5, etc.) show significant performance gaps, especially in Arabic, with entity recall and accuracy metrics highlighting limitations in deep reasoning and information tracing. Results reveal that even top models struggle, emphasizing the benchmark's difficulty and the need for improved multilingual long-context capabilities.

## Method Summary
LC-Eval is constructed as a bilingual multi-task benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in both English and Arabic. The benchmark includes four novel task types: multi-document question answering, bilingual question answering, claim verification, and multiple-choice questions. Context lengths range from 4,000 to over 128,000 tokens, pushing the limits of current models. The evaluation methodology employs a custom entity-relationship-based approach to assess semantic understanding in open-ended responses, focusing on entity recall and accuracy. The benchmark is tested on a range of both open-weight and closed large language models, including GPT-4o, Llama-3, and Qwen2.5, to compare performance across languages and task types.

## Key Results
- LC-Eval demonstrates significant performance gaps in long-context understanding, especially for Arabic tasks
- Entity recall and accuracy metrics reveal limitations in deep reasoning and information tracing across all models
- Even top-tier models (GPT-4o, Llama-3, Qwen2.5) struggle with the benchmark's difficulty, highlighting the need for improved multilingual long-context capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's design leverages entity-relationship-based evaluation to capture semantic understanding beyond simple factual recall. By requiring models to trace information across long contexts and across languages, it stresses core reasoning and memory capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Long-context processing**: Why needed—models must retain and integrate information over thousands of tokens; Quick check—test retrieval accuracy at increasing context lengths
- **Cross-lingual semantic mapping**: Why needed—Arabic and English require robust translation and alignment; Quick check—evaluate bilingual QA accuracy
- **Entity-relationship tracking**: Why needed—semantic understanding depends on linking entities across text; Quick check—measure entity recall and accuracy
- **Multi-document integration**: Why needed—real-world tasks often span multiple sources; Quick check—assess claim verification consistency
- **Open-ended response evaluation**: Why needed—standard metrics may miss nuanced understanding; Quick check—compare custom vs. human evaluation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data collection -> Task design -> Entity extraction -> Scoring engine -> Benchmark suite
**Critical Path**: Input context → Entity extraction → Answer generation → Entity recall scoring → Final accuracy metric
**Design Tradeoffs**: Custom entity-based scoring vs. standard metrics—higher semantic fidelity but more complex validation
**Failure Signatures**: Low entity recall suggests poor information tracing; accuracy drops at long contexts indicate memory limits; bilingual gaps point to language-specific weaknesses
**First Experiments**: (1) Run entity recall on short vs. long contexts to establish baseline trends; (2) Compare model performance on English-only vs. bilingual tasks; (3) Test sensitivity of scoring by varying entity extraction thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Data quality and representativeness lack detailed validation and bias mitigation documentation
- Custom evaluation method introduces potential subjectivity and lacks comprehensive alignment with human judgment
- Model comparison may be confounded by inference settings and prompt engineering differences

## Confidence
- Data Quality: Medium
- Evaluation Methodology: Medium
- Model Comparison: Medium
- Scalability/Generalizability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a human evaluation study comparing the entity-relationship-based scoring method against expert human judgments across 100+ diverse responses to establish reliability and validity of the automated scoring approach.
2. Perform ablation studies on prompt engineering and inference parameters for the same models to quantify the impact of evaluation setup on reported performance gaps, particularly for the Arabic tasks.
3. Test model performance on a subset of LC-Eval tasks using alternative evaluation frameworks (e.g., standard QA metrics, human pairwise comparisons) to determine whether the claimed performance differences persist across evaluation methodologies.
