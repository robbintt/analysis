# A Case Study of Balanced Query Recommendation on Wikipedia

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.20399
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20399
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** BalancedQR framework generates less biased search queries by optimizing for relevance and multiple bias dimensions simultaneously

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BalancedQR, a query recommendation framework designed to mitigate bias in information retrieval systems by suggesting alternative search queries with less bias than the original query. The framework extends previous work to handle multiple dimensions of bias simultaneously (such as gender and geography) using a Pareto front approach that optimizes for both relevance and bias reduction. The authors evaluate three different methods for generating candidate queries and demonstrate through a case study on Wikipedia that their approach successfully transforms biased queries into more diverse alternatives, retrieving documents from multiple geographic regions and with greater gender diversity.

## Method Summary
The BalancedQR framework uses Pareto front optimization to generate query recommendations that balance relevance with bias reduction across multiple dimensions. The system evaluates candidate queries based on both their relevance to the original query and their bias scores across various dimensions (gender, geography, etc.). Three methods are proposed for generating candidate queries: (1) using word embeddings directly to create semantically similar queries, (2) using word embeddings combined with LLM prompting for more sophisticated reformulation, and (3) using dataset-provided keywords with LLM prompting. The approach maintains user agency by offering recommendations rather than enforcing debiasing, allowing users to choose whether to pursue more diverse information sources.

## Key Results
- Method 2 (word embeddings with LLM prompting) outperformed other generation methods in producing diverse, relevant query alternatives
- Case study showed transformation of geographically biased queries (e.g., "Politics" returning mostly North American content) into queries retrieving documents from multiple regions
- Gender diversity in retrieved documents improved significantly when using BalancedQR recommendations versus original queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging Pareto front optimization to identify query alternatives that simultaneously satisfy relevance requirements while reducing multiple forms of bias. By generating diverse candidate queries and evaluating them across multiple bias dimensions, the system can identify recommendations that offer better balance than the original query. The use of LLM prompting with word embeddings allows for semantic understanding that goes beyond simple keyword matching, enabling more sophisticated query reformulation that maintains topical relevance while expanding geographic and demographic coverage.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pareto front optimization** - needed for balancing multiple competing objectives (relevance vs. bias reduction); quick check: verify the algorithm correctly identifies non-dominated solutions
- **Bias measurement in IR systems** - needed to quantify and track bias across multiple dimensions; quick check: ensure bias metrics are reliable and reproducible
- **Semantic query reformulation** - needed to generate diverse yet relevant query alternatives; quick check: validate semantic similarity between original and reformulated queries
- **LLM-based query generation** - needed for sophisticated query transformation beyond simple keyword substitution; quick check: test prompt engineering effectiveness
- **User-driven debiasing** - needed to respect user agency while providing bias-aware recommendations; quick check: evaluate user adoption rates in real systems
- **Multi-dimensional bias analysis** - needed to address complex bias patterns beyond single dimensions; quick check: verify cross-dimensional interactions are properly handled

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Query -> Candidate Generation -> Bias/Relevance Evaluation -> Pareto Front Selection -> Query Recommendations

**Critical Path:** The most critical path is the evaluation loop where candidate queries are assessed for both relevance to the original query and bias scores across multiple dimensions. This dual evaluation determines which queries make it to the Pareto front and ultimately become recommendations.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system trades computational complexity for diversity, as evaluating multiple bias dimensions and generating diverse candidates requires more processing than simple query expansion. The user-driven approach trades immediate bias reduction for user agency and potentially higher adoption rates.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor candidate generation may result in recommendations that are either too similar to the original (failing to reduce bias) or too dissimilar (losing relevance). Inadequate bias measurement can lead to false confidence in diversity improvements. Over-aggressive debiasing may produce irrelevant recommendations that users reject.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test candidate generation methods on a small set of queries to compare diversity and relevance trade-offs
2. Evaluate bias measurement accuracy on known biased vs. balanced query sets
3. Verify Pareto front selection correctly identifies optimal trade-off points between relevance and bias reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on Wikipedia-specific datasets may limit generalizability to other search contexts
- Small sample size (50 original queries and 2000 variants) may not capture full diversity of real-world query patterns
- Reliance on metadata quality for gender and geography bias measurements introduces potential measurement errors
- LLM-based methods introduce subjectivity in query reformulation process

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical framework and experimental results showing consistent diversity improvements
- **Medium confidence**: Performance ranking of query generation methods, though dependent on dataset characteristics
- **Low confidence**: Real-world effectiveness of user-driven approach without user study validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test BalancedQR on web search, academic search, or e-commerce queries to assess generalizability
2. **User study**: Evaluate whether diverse query recommendations lead to better information discovery and user satisfaction
3. **Longitudinal bias tracking**: Study how bias patterns evolve over time with repeated user interactions with recommendations
