# Fixed-Budget Change Point Identification in Piecewise Constant Bandits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.12957
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12957
- **Authors**: Joseph Lazzaro; Ciara Pike-Burke
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel algorithms SH, SHB, and SHA achieve near-minimax optimality for locating change points in piecewise constant bandit rewards under fixed budget constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of identifying a single change point in a piecewise constant reward function using bandit feedback with a fixed query budget. The authors establish theoretical lower bounds showing a fundamental separation between small and large budget regimes, and develop two algorithms—Sequential Halving (SH) and Sequential Halving with Backtracking (SHB)—that are nearly minimax optimal in their respective regimes. They further propose a regime-adaptive algorithm, SHA, that performs near-optimally across both regimes. The work is supported by theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly when the change point is near the boundary of the action space.

## Method Summary
The paper studies change point identification in piecewise constant bandit settings with fixed budget constraints. The authors establish lower bounds for both small and large budget regimes, showing a fundamental separation in problem difficulty between these regimes. They develop two algorithms: Sequential Halving (SH) for small budgets and Sequential Halving with Backtracking (SHB) for large budgets, both achieving near-minimax optimality. The SHB algorithm incorporates backtracking to improve localization when the change point is near boundaries. A regime-adaptive algorithm SHA is proposed that combines SH and SHB to perform near-optimally across both regimes. Theoretical guarantees are provided for each algorithm, with error probabilities scaling exponentially with budget and gap size.

## Key Results
- Established lower bounds showing a separation between small and large budget regimes for change point identification
- Developed SH and SHB algorithms that are nearly minimax optimal in their respective regimes
- Proposed SHA algorithm that performs near-optimally across both regimes simultaneously
- SHB achieves error probability of exp(-∆²T/(600σ²) + 13log(1/2η)), while SH achieves exp(-T∆²/(36σ²log²(1/2η)))
- Experiments show superior performance compared to existing methods, especially for boundary change points

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by adaptively narrowing down the search space for the change point through sequential elimination of suboptimal regions. SHB's backtracking mechanism allows it to recover from early mistakes when the change point is near boundaries, while SH's simpler structure is more efficient for smaller budgets. The key insight is that the difficulty of the problem fundamentally changes depending on available budget, requiring different algorithmic strategies for each regime.

## Foundational Learning
- **Change point detection**: Understanding when and where distributions change in sequential data; needed for formulating the problem and measuring success
- **Multi-armed bandit theory**: Framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty; provides the theoretical foundation for regret and error analysis
- **Minimax optimality**: Concept of worst-case performance bounds; used to establish the theoretical limits and evaluate algorithm performance
- **Sequential elimination**: Strategy of progressively removing suboptimal options; core mechanism enabling efficient search under budget constraints
- **Backtracking algorithms**: Methods that can reverse decisions when new information becomes available; enables SHB to handle boundary cases
- **Concentration inequalities**: Mathematical tools for bounding deviations from expected values; essential for establishing theoretical guarantees

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query Generator -> Reward Estimator -> Change Point Locator -> Error Estimator

**Critical Path**: The algorithm iteratively selects query points, estimates rewards at these points, updates beliefs about change point location, and terminates when budget is exhausted or confidence threshold is met.

**Design Tradeoffs**: SH prioritizes simplicity and small-budget efficiency at the cost of suboptimal large-budget performance, while SHB adds backtracking complexity to handle boundary cases better but requires larger budgets to be effective.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- SH may fail catastrophically when change point is near boundaries with insufficient budget
- SHB may waste queries in large-budget regime when change point is centrally located
- Both algorithms assume known noise variance, which could lead to poor performance if this assumption is violated

**First Experiments**:
1. Synthetic test with small budget and central change point to verify SH performance
2. Synthetic test with large budget and boundary change point to verify SHB's backtracking advantage
3. Comparative test across regimes with varying budgets to validate SHA's adaptivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees assume known sub-Gaussian noise, which may not hold in practice
- Confidence intervals rely on precise estimates of noise variance σ², which could be challenging to obtain accurately
- Constants in lower bounds (such as factor 600 in SHB exponent) may not be tight, potentially overestimating true problem difficulty

## Confidence

**High**: The existence of a separation between small and large budget regimes is well-supported by both theory and experiments.

**Medium**: The near-minimax optimality claims for SH and SHB are convincing but rely on specific assumptions about the noise distribution.

**Medium**: The superiority of SHA over existing methods is demonstrated empirically but may not generalize to all problem instances.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness to Unknown Noise Variance**: Conduct experiments where the noise variance σ² is unknown and must be estimated online. Evaluate how this affects the performance of SH, SHB, and SHA.

2. **Extension to Multiple Change Points**: Test the algorithms on synthetic data with multiple change points to assess their adaptability and robustness in more complex scenarios.

3. **Real-World Data Evaluation**: Apply the proposed methods to a real-world dataset (e.g., sensor data or financial time series) with known change points to validate their practical utility and compare their performance to state-of-the-art methods.
