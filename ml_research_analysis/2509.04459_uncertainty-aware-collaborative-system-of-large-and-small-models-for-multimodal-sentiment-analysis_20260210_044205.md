# Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System of Large and Small Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.04459
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04459
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel U-ACS framework combines lightweight UBM with MLLMs for MSA, achieving up to 67% runtime reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) that combines a lightweight Uncertainty-aware Baseline Model (UBM) with powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for multimodal sentiment analysis. The system addresses the performance-efficiency trade-off by routing samples based on uncertainty estimates, with the UBM handling confident predictions and escalating uncertain samples to MLLMs for deeper analysis. To overcome the challenge of uncertainty estimation in regression tasks, the authors innovatively convert continuous sentiment prediction to a classification problem using entropy-based uncertainty quantification. The framework employs a three-stage progressive processing pipeline with weighted averaging and cross-verification strategies for conflicting predictions.

## Method Summary
The U-ACS framework consists of a three-stage pipeline. Stage 1 uses a UBM (BERT+LSTM) to process all samples, calculating uncertainty via entropy from a 3-class classifier. Samples with uncertainty below threshold τ₁ are returned immediately. Stage 2 escalates uncertain samples to MLLMs (HumanOmni or VideoLLaMA2-7B with LoRA), which verify predictions. If polarities match, results are averaged; if both remain uncertain, Stage 3 triggers prompt-based cross-verification. The system uses Gaussian fitting on validation sets to determine statistical thresholds, achieving significant computational savings by limiting expensive MLLM inference to difficult samples.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 67% runtime reduction compared to standalone MLLMs while maintaining or improving classification accuracy
- U-ACS reduces runtime from 379s to 125s on MOSI dataset compared to standalone HumanOmni
- Demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS)
- Ablation studies confirm the value of classification-based entropy, threshold calibration, and cross-verification mechanisms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Converting continuous sentiment regression into a discrete classification task enables robust uncertainty estimation via entropy, which is otherwise difficult in standard regression outputs.
- **Mechanism:** The Uncertainty-aware Baseline Model (UBM) employs a dual-head architecture: one head for regression and an auxiliary classifier (Positive/Negative/Neutral). Instead of relying on regression variance (which is hard to estimate directly), the system calculates entropy from the classifier's softmax output. High entropy indicates the model is "confused" between classes, identifying hard samples.
- **Core assumption:** High classification entropy correlates strongly with regression difficulty and potential error.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-C4]: "We innovatively convert continuous sentiment label prediction task to a classification task... This operation allows us to accurately calculate sample entropy."
  - [Abstract]: "...strategies for handling conflicting predictions and uses weighted averaging for similar polarities."
  - [Corpus]: *Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence* discusses agentic frameworks for MLLMs but focuses on general uncertainty; this paper's specific regression-to-classification conversion for entropy is distinct.
- **Break condition:** If classification entropy does not correlate with regression error (e.g., the model is confidently wrong), the routing mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** An uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism significantly reduces computational overhead by restricting expensive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) inference to a subset of difficult samples.
- **Mechanism:** The system uses a three-stage pipeline. Stage 1 processes all samples with the efficient UBM. Only samples where uncertainty exceeds threshold τ₁ proceed to Stage 2 (MLLM). If the MLLM is also uncertain, the system either averages results (if polarities agree) or escalates to Stage 3 (re-prompting).
- **Core assumption:** The computational cost of the UBM is negligible compared to the MLLM, and the MLLM is strictly superior at handling ambiguous inputs.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-E]: "Only those samples yielding high predictive uncertainty... are selectively escalated to the MLLM."
  - [Table IV]: Shows runtime reduction from 379s to 125s on MOSI dataset compared to standalone HumanOmni.
  - [Corpus]: *SAEC* highlights similar edge-cloud trade-offs where MLLMs handle complex cases failed by edge models, validating the general "cascade" efficiency logic.
- **Break condition:** If the uncertainty threshold τ₁ is set too low, the MLLM is underutilized and accuracy drops; if set too high, efficiency gains vanish.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Cross-verification via prompt augmentation resolves conflicting predictions between the small and large models more effectively than simple averaging.
- **Mechanism:** When the UBM and MLLM disagree on polarity (one positive, one negative) and both show high uncertainty, the system triggers Stage 3. It embeds the conflicting predictions and uncertainties directly into the MLLM's prompt, forcing a "second look" with explicit context about the model disagreement.
- **Core assumption:** The MLLM has the reasoning capacity to arbitrate between conflicting signals when explicitly prompted with the disagreement context.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section III-E]: "Augment the prompt with previous predictions and uncertainties... prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting predictions."
  - [Table VII]: "W/o Cross-Verification" shows a drop in Acc2, implying this arbitration step adds value for the hardest samples.
  - [Corpus]: *ReFineG* mentions synergizing small models and LLMs but focuses on retrieval; the explicit "disagreement arbitration" via prompting is specific to this architecture.
- **Break condition:** If the MLLM is prone to hallucination when given conflicting hints, this step could degrade performance further.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Entropy as a proxy for Uncertainty**
  - **Why needed here:** The core routing logic depends on quantifying "how confused" the model is. You must understand that higher entropy H(p) = -Σ p log p means a flatter probability distribution (more uncertainty).
  - **Quick check question:** If a classifier outputs probabilities [0.9, 0.05, 0.05] vs. [0.4, 0.3, 0.3], which sample is routed to the MLLM?

- **Concept: Regression-to-Classification Transformation**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard regression outputs a point estimate (e.g., score 0.5) without an inherent probability distribution for entropy calculation. The paper maps this to 3 classes to exploit well-defined classification uncertainty metrics.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't we just use the magnitude of the regression output as a confidence score? (Hint: A score of 0.0 might be highly confident neutral or highly uncertain).

- **Concept: Cascade/Router Architectures**
  - **Why needed here:** This is not an ensemble where models vote on every sample. It is a waterfall. Understanding the flow control (if-else logic based on thresholds) is vital for debugging why a specific sample did or didn't reach the MLLM.
  - **Quick check question:** In a standard ensemble, Model A and Model B run every time. In this cascade, when does Model B (MLLM) run?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Input: Video/Text/Audio
  - UBM: BERT (Text) + LSTM (Video/Audio) -> Fusion -> Regression Head & Classification Head (for uncertainty)
  - Router: Logic comparing Classification Entropy vs. Thresholds (τ₁, τ₂)
  - MLLM: HumanOmni or VideoLLaMA2 (7B parameters), adapted via LoRA
  - Aggregator: Logic handling Stage 2 (weighted avg) and Stage 3 (prompt augmentation)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Stage 1: UBM inference. If entropy < τ₁, Return
  2. Stage 2: MLLM inference. If entropy < τ₂, Return. If entropy > τ₂ but polarities match, Average & Return
  3. Stage 3: If high entropy + polarity mismatch -> Construct enhanced prompt -> MLLM re-inference -> Return

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Latency vs. Accuracy: Lowering thresholds routes more traffic to the MLLM, increasing accuracy (on hard samples) but lowering efficiency
  - Simplicity vs. Nuance: The UBM is cheap but "dumber"; the MLLM is smart but slow. The system breaks if the UBM is "confidently wrong" (low uncertainty, wrong prediction), as this bypasses the MLLM entirely

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Confidently Wrong" UBM: If the small model has low entropy but incorrect polarity, the error is locked in. Look for low-entropy samples with high regression error in validation
  - Threshold Drift: If the validation set is not representative of the test set, the statistical thresholds (τ) may route too many/too few samples

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Threshold Sensitivity Sweep: Vary λ (threshold weight) to plot the curve of Runtime vs. Acc2/MAE (as shown in Fig 3) to find the sweet spot for your specific hardware constraints
  2. Ablation on Uncertainty Method: Replace the "Classification-based Entropy" with "Prediction-Truth Difference" or "Ensemble Variance" to verify that the proposed entropy method actually provides the best routing signal (replicate Table VII)
  3. Cross-Verification Analysis: Isolate samples that reach Stage 3. Compare the final result against a baseline where Stage 3 is just a random choice or simple average to prove the value of the "prompt-augmented" arbitration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can a regression-specific uncertainty estimation method (e.g., heteroscedastic regression or evidential deep learning) outperform the proposed Classification-based Entropy (CBE) approach in routing accuracy without sacrificing inference speed?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] In Section III.C.4, the authors note that estimating uncertainty for regression tasks is "very difficult" and "innovatively convert the continuous sentiment label prediction task to a classification task" to compute entropy. While effective, this discretization potentially discards fine-grained intensity information that could aid in identifying uncertain samples.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates CBE is better than Prediction-Truth Differences and Ensemble Variance, but does not compare against modern probabilistic regression techniques that output continuous distributions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative ablation study replacing the CBE module with a probabilistic regression baseline (e.g., using negative log-likelihood of a Gaussian distribution) to measure any delta in routing efficiency or final MAE.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the collaborative system be modified to improve regression metrics (MAE/Corr) to match the performance of standalone MLLMs, rather than prioritizing classification metrics (Acc2)?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] In Section IV.E, the authors explicitly state that "standalone MLLM occasionally retain an edge in regression-focused metrics like MAE and Corr" because the system prioritizes "rapidly and correctly identifying the sentiment polarity" (Acc2) over fine-grained intensity. They acknowledge this as a "deliberate trade-off."
- **Why unresolved:** The current weighting averaging (Eq. 15) and routing logic are optimized for polarity, leaving the performance gap in regression metrics as an inherent limitation of the current design.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments utilizing regression-specific losses or intensity-aware weighting strategies in the collaborative stage to see if MAE can be reduced without increasing inference latency.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does the reliance on validation-set Gaussian fitting for threshold determination limit the system's robustness to domain shifts or real-time data streams?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] In Section III.F, the authors describe a "principled statistical approach" using Gaussian fitting on a validation set to determine thresholds τ₁ and τ₂. The method assumes that the distribution of uncertainty in future data will mirror the validation set.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper does not analyze how sensitive the performance is to changes in data distribution (e.g., a sudden influx of sarcastic or ambiguous videos) that might alter the uncertainty landscape, potentially rendering the static thresholds sub-optimal.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Stress-testing the model on out-of-distribution datasets (cross-domain testing) without recalculating thresholds to observe performance degradation, or implementing an adaptive threshold mechanism for comparison.

## Limitations

- The system prioritizes classification metrics (Acc2) over regression metrics (MAE/Corr), leaving a performance gap in fine-grained intensity prediction
- The cascade architecture risks locking in "confidently wrong"
