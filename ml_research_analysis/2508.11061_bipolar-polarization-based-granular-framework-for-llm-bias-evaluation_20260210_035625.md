# BIPOLAR: Polarization-based granular framework for LLM bias evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11061
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces BIPOLAR, a granular framework for detecting and analyzing polarization-driven bias in large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary
BIPOLAR introduces a systematic, symmetry-based approach to detecting polarization-driven bias in LLMs by generating synthetic, polarity-balanced datasets based on the CAMEO event ontology. The framework evaluates model responses to symmetric statements about opposing entities (e.g., Russia vs. Ukraine) across multiple semantic categories and prompt variants. A case study on the Russia-Ukraine conflict revealed varying bias profiles across five LLMs, with open models showing stronger shifts under citizenship cues compared to proprietary models. The method supports fine-grained, interpretable diagnostics and is extensible to other polarized domains.

## Method Summary
The BIPOLAR framework generates synthetic statements using the CAMEO event ontology, creating symmetric pairs that differ only in target entity, event polarity, and semantic category. These statements are evaluated across multiple prompt variants (vanilla, language-specific, citizenship-specific, in-context) using a 0-100 sentiment scoring model. Bias is quantified via mean sentiment differences and Jensen-Shannon divergence between entity-specific score distributions. The framework was applied to five LLMs (LLaMA 3, Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.0) across 15 conflict-related categories.

## Key Results
- LLaMA 3 exhibited the least bias overall, while Mistral showed strong negative sentiment toward Russia
- Open models (LLaMA 3, Mistral) demonstrated stronger susceptibility to prompt framing than proprietary models
- Category-specific bias patterns emerged, with some domains showing model consensus while others showed high variance
- The framework successfully detected systematic bias through symmetry-based evaluation across multiple semantic dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Symmetric, polarity-balanced prompts enable systematic bias detection by comparing model responses to structurally equivalent statements about opposing entities.
- Mechanism: The framework generates statement pairs that differ only in target entity (e.g., Russia vs. Ukraine), event polarity (positive vs. negative), and semantic category. Divergence in sentiment scores between symmetric pairs reveals entity-specific bias. Quantified via Jensen-Shannon divergence and mean sentiment difference per category.
- Core assumption: Sentiment scoring models accurately reflect model stance; output scores are not artifacts of prompt formatting or instruction-following quirks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "symmetry-based sentiment evaluation scheme"
  - [section 3.1] "From each combination of topic, category, event, entity, role, polarity, and temporal frame, a final statement is generated"
  - [section 3.3] "the symmetry of the statements, which allows one to detect systematic bias as a divergence in the average sentiment"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus evidence; related work (Durmus et al., 2023 in refs) on cross-national prompts cited but not linked in provided corpus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt framing (language, citizenship cues, in-context information) shifts sentiment systematically, with open models exhibiting stronger susceptibility than proprietary models.
- Mechanism: By varying the linguistic and identity context of prompts (e.g., "respond as a citizen of Ukraine" vs. "respond as a citizen of Russia"), the framework measures directional sentiment shifts. Open models (LLaMA 3, Mistral) showed larger magnitude shifts than proprietary models (Claude 3.5, GPT-4, Gemini 1.0).
- Core assumption: Shifts reflect latent "national" or linguistic biases rather than increased confusion or task misinterpretation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "open models showing stronger shifts in sentiment under citizenship or language cues compared to proprietary models"
  - [section 4.6] "the open models – Llama and Mistral – generally increased the sentiment to negative statements... the effect of citizenship was much stronger than that of language"
  - [corpus] No directly equivalent corpus papers on open vs. proprietary model sensitivity to identity cues; evidence is paper-specific.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Category-specific bias patterns emerge, with some semantic domains (e.g., "investigate," "yield") producing anomalous or cross-model-consistent bias.
- Mechanism: By structuring statements via the CAMEO event ontology, the framework isolates bias to semantic categories. Some categories show model consensus (e.g., negative "yield" biased toward Ukraine), others show high variance across models ("investigate").
- Core assumption: CAMEO categories sufficiently discretize semantic space; anomalies reflect meaningful category–model interactions, not dataset artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "visible anomaly in the category investigate (positive event but negative sentiment in most models)"
  - [section 4.4, Table 1] "the most biased categories are controversial... the least biased categories coincide with the consensual ones"
  - [corpus] Indirect support from bias-granularity literature (e.g., "The Bias is in the Details"), but no direct replication of CAMEO-based category bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Symmetry in Experimental Design
  - Why needed here: Bias detection requires controlling for all variables except the target of interest; asymmetric designs confound bias with task difficulty or statement semantics.
  - Quick check question: If you swap entity labels (Russia↔Ukraine) in all statements, would observed bias reverse direction?

- Concept: Ontology-Grounded Dataset Generation
  - Why needed here: Structured semantic categories enable fine-grained diagnostics; ad-hoc statements risk conflating multiple bias sources.
  - Quick check question: Can you trace each statement back to a specific CAMEO category, polarity, and entity role?

- Concept: Distributional Bias Metrics (Jensen-Shannon Divergence)
  - Why needed here: Point estimates of sentiment can miss systematic distributional differences; JS divergence quantifies dissimilarity between entity-specific score distributions.
  - Quick check question: For a given category, do Russia and Ukraine sentiment score distributions overlap significantly (low JS) or separate (high JS)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset Generator -> Prompt Engine -> Model Interface -> Evaluation Layer
- Critical path:
  1. Define polarized topic and select ontology categories (e.g., CAMEO)
  2. Generate symmetric statement pairs across all factor combinations
  3. Prompt each model variant (vanilla, language, citizenship, in-context)
  4. Collect scores, filter malformed outputs
  5. Compute per-category bias metrics and visualize

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Synthetic vs. real statements: Synthetic enables full control and symmetry; may lack ecological validity
  - Ontology choice: CAMEO provides conflict-event structure; may not generalize to non-conflict domains without adaptation
  - Open vs. proprietary models: Open models allow deeper diagnostics; proprietary models may have stronger alignment/RLHF dampening effects

- Failure signatures:
  - Models return non-numeric or out-of-range scores; retry or exclude
  - Sentiment distributions collapse to narrow bands (e.g., all 50); indicates scoring insensitivity
  - Symmetry check fails: identical statements with swapped entities produce wildly different scores unrelated to entity identity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Russia-Ukraine case with a subset of 5 categories and 2 models (1 open, 1 proprietary) to validate pipeline
  2. Test prompt variant effect: run vanilla vs. citizenship-framed prompts on the same statement set; quantify shift magnitude
  3. Extend to a new polarized topic (e.g., vaccination debate) using adapted categories; compare cross-domain bias profiles

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do non-Euro-American LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek, Qwen) exhibit significantly different bias profiles or polarization patterns when evaluated using the BIPOLAR framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly list the inclusion of models "outside the dominant Euro-American technological ecosystem" as a necessary step to strengthen conclusions in Section 5.1 (Limitations).
- Why unresolved: The current study was restricted to a small sample of primarily Western-developed models (LLaMA, Mistral, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the BIPOLAR dataset and metrics to Chinese or other global LLMs to compare their JS divergence and sentiment scores against the current baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does varying the temporal frame (past/future) and entity role (subject/object) impact the magnitude and direction of bias detected by the framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4 notes the study was "restricted to using the present temporal frame and the subject entity role," while Section 5.2 proposes extending the methodology along these "conceptual dimensions."
- Why unresolved: The experiment design held these variables constant to reduce complexity, leaving their potential effects on sentiment polarity unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generating new dataset variants utilizing past and future tenses and object roles, then comparing the resulting sentiment shifts against the original subject/present-tense data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the BIPOLAR framework reveal consistent bias trends across different polarized domains, such as the China-Taiwan dispute or vaccination debates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.2 states that additional topics would allow analysis of whether "LLMs exhibit consistent patterns of bias across semantic domains or whether their responses vary significantly."
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the framework via a single case study (Russia-Ukraine conflict).
- What evidence would resolve it: Constructing synthetic datasets for the proposed topics (e.g., Israel-Iran, immigration) and correlating the bias profiles (e.g., radar plots, divergence scores) with those found in the Russia-Ukraine case.

## Limitations
- Synthetic statement generation may not fully capture real-world discourse nuance, potentially limiting ecological validity
- Framework relies on CAMEO ontology which may not generalize to non-conflict domains without adaptation
- Exact statement text, sample counts, retry policies, and generation hyperparameters are not specified, impacting reproducibility

## Confidence
- High confidence: Framework's ability to detect systematic bias through symmetric, polarity-balanced prompts and distributional metrics
- Medium confidence: Claim that open models exhibit stronger susceptibility to prompt framing than proprietary models
- Medium confidence: Observation of category-specific bias patterns tied to CAMEO ontology structure

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the Russia-Ukraine case study with a reduced set of categories and models to validate the pipeline and check for consistent bias detection
2. Test the sensitivity of open vs. proprietary models to prompt framing by running vanilla and citizenship-framed prompts on the same statement set, quantifying shift magnitude
3. Extend the framework to a new polarized topic (e.g., vaccination debate) using adapted categories, comparing cross-domain bias profiles to assess generalizability
