# Generative KI für TA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02053
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02053
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Generative AI can assist in TA tasks like literature review and horizon scanning but requires human verification due to hallucinations, bias, and reasoning limitations

## Executive Summary
Generative AI enables natural-language interaction with machines and can produce text, images, and code, but suffers from hallucinations, bias, opacity, and limited reasoning ability. These problems stem from structural causes including poor training data quality, difficulty aligning models with ethical standards, inability to learn continuously, and lack of world models. For Technology Assessment, generative AI can speed up data gathering and initial processing but cannot replace human judgment. Current use should be limited to ideation and support with all outputs critically reviewed to prevent skill loss in TA practitioners.

## Method Summary
This conceptual analysis paper examines structural limitations of generative AI (LLMs, chatbots) for Technology Assessment work. The paper reviews literature on LLM problems and provides qualitative argumentation about eight structural causes of AI limitations. No datasets, training procedures, or quantitative metrics are specified. The analysis focuses on evaluating LLM applicability for TA tasks through conceptual framework rather than experimental testing.

## Key Results
- Generative AI suffers from eight structural causes: data quality issues, alignment difficulties, context-content tension, lack of continuous learning, missing social perspectives, absent world models, reasoning limitations, and reproduction problems
- For TA work, AI can assist with literature review, clustering information, and language tasks but requires human verification
- Over-reliance on AI risks loss of essential analytical and interpretive skills in TA practitioners

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Alignment interventions can reduce toxic outputs but cannot guarantee reliability
- Mechanism: Post-hoc training and prompt-level instructions bias model outputs by reshaping token probability distributions in high-risk regions
- Core assumption: Model's internal representations remain shaped by pre-training data; alignment layers are corrections, not rewrites
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "difficulty aligning models with ethical and factual standards"; section 2(2) states fine-tuning cannot sufficiently increase reliability; related work confirms alignment does not eliminate risk

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-context learning improves output quality but introduces sycophancy
- Mechanism: Few-shot examples condition subsequent token generation by establishing local statistical patterns without verifying truth
- Core assumption: Attention mechanism weighs context tokens alongside learned weights but lacks grounding to verify truth
- Evidence anchors: Abstract notes "inability to truly learn continuously"; section 2(3) shows context content gets adopted regardless of truth; related papers focus on code generation reliability

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Chain-of-Thought prompting improves reasoning on familiar structures but fails on novel variants
- Mechanism: CoT extends inference chain, allowing intermediate tokens to condition final outputs through pattern matching rather than true logical inference
- Core assumption: Performance gains reflect retrieval of similar reasoning traces from training data, not emergent reasoning capability
- Evidence anchors: Section 2(7) shows failure when tasks deviate from training examples (citing Mirzadeh et al. 2024); related work confirms AI co-scientist systems fail at verification tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Grounding Problem**
  - Why needed here: Explains why language models manipulate form without access to meaning or real-world referents, leading to factually untethered outputs
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model trained only on text cannot verify its outputs against reality?

- Concept: **Catastrophic Forgetting**
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning can overwrite previously learned content, limiting how much alignment can correct without degrading other capabilities
  - Quick check question: What happens when a neural network is trained on new data without mechanisms to protect existing knowledge?

- Concept: **World Models (physical, phenomenological, psychological)**
  - Why needed here: Current LLMs lack all three types, explaining failures in spatiotemporal reasoning and common sense
  - Quick check question: Why can a video generator produce plausible frames without understanding physics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-training corpus -> Alignment layer -> Inference engine -> Verification boundary (Human reviewer)
- Critical path: Prompt design → Model inference → Human verification → Accept/reject. No output should proceed to TA deliverable without passing verification.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Larger context windows increase sycophancy risk
  - Stronger alignment may reduce capability on edge cases
  - CoT improves transparency but increases inference cost and may create false confidence
  - Speed gains from automation vs. skill atrophy from reduced engagement
- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinated citations or invented sources
  - Confident assertions on topics outside training distribution
  - Inconsistent reasoning across similar queries
  - Reproduction of bias patterns despite alignment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run literature review task with known ground truth; measure recall and hallucination rate to calibrate trust boundaries
  2. Test CoT vs. standard prompting on reasoning task with novel variants; document where performance degrades
  3. Compare outputs with and without few-shot examples containing deliberate errors; assess sycophancy susceptibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can training algorithms be developed that allow LLMs to learn continuously in real-time without catastrophic forgetting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 4 notes current models cannot make their own experiences or learn continuously, with "intensive research" ongoing
- Why unresolved: Current training is static; updating models often overwrites previous knowledge or degrades performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of training architecture that integrates new information dynamically without losing previously acquired capabilities

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do LLMs possess actual reasoning capabilities, or do they merely rely on "sycophancy" and replication of training data structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 7 discusses CoT limitations and cites research showing models fail when tasks deviate slightly from training examples
- Why unresolved: Difficult to distinguish genuine logical deduction from sophisticated pattern matching on known problem structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Consistent performance on novel, out-of-distribution logical puzzles that cannot be solved by retrieving similar examples

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can generative AI be endowed with a functional "world model" to prevent physical inconsistencies in simulations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 6 identifies lack of realistic world model as structural cause for incoherent outputs, specifically in video generators like SORA
- Why unresolved: Current architectures learn statistical correlations rather than underlying physical laws or causal mechanisms
- What evidence would resolve it: Video generation or robotic simulation where objects persist and interact according to basic physical laws over extended timeframes

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can TA methodologies integrate generative AI without causing loss of essential analytical and interpretive skills in researchers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Conclusion warns AI helps manage information floods but over-reliance risks degrading "intensive reading" and understanding skills central to TA
- Why unresolved: Tension between efficiency (using AI for summaries) and cognitive process of deep reading required for synthesis
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of TA report quality and analyst skill retention in workflows with high vs. low AI assistance

## Limitations
- No quantitative benchmarks for TA-specific tasks; analysis based on literature review rather than systematic empirical testing
- Limited discussion of domain-specific performance variations across different TA subfields
- Recommendations for TA workflows lack operational detail and specific evaluation criteria

## Confidence
- High: Well-documented issues like hallucinations and bias
- Medium: Alignment limitations and reasoning failures
- Low: Specific recommendations about TA workflows lacking operational detail

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments testing LLM performance on horizon scanning tasks with known ground truth to establish baseline reliability metrics
2. Implement and document standardized verification protocol for LLM outputs in literature review contexts, measuring time efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs
3. Test sycophancy hypothesis by systematically varying context examples in prompts for normative TA questions, documenting how output alignment shifts with context changes
