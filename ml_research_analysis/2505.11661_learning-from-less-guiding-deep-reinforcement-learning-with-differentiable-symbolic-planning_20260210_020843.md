# Learning from Less: Guiding Deep Reinforcement Learning with Differentiable Symbolic Planning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.11661
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11661
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Dylan improves RL performance on sparse-reward tasks using differentiable symbolic planning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of sparse rewards in reinforcement learning by proposing Dylan, a differentiable symbolic planner that dynamically shapes rewards using human prior knowledge encoded as structured symbolic rules. Dylan operates both as a reward model and a differentiable planner, enabling agents to learn more efficiently and generalize to new tasks through compositional policy primitives. Experiments on MiniGrid-DoorKey environments show that Dylan significantly improves learning performance over baselines like PPO and A2C, especially in complex tasks.

## Method Summary
Dylan combines symbolic planning with deep reinforcement learning by encoding human-provided symbolic rules into a differentiable planner that can guide reward shaping. The system operates by parsing symbolic rules into a structured representation, then using these rules to generate dynamic rewards during the planning process. The differentiable nature allows gradients to flow through the planning component, enabling end-to-end learning. Dylan can operate in different search modes (DFS vs BFS) and compose low-level primitives to solve unseen tasks without retraining, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

## Key Results
- Dylan significantly outperforms PPO and A2C baselines on MiniGrid-DoorKey tasks
- The approach shows improved learning efficiency, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards
- Dylan can compose low-level primitives to solve unseen tasks without retraining, demonstrating generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Dylan works by bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and deep learning through differentiable planning. The key insight is that human-provided symbolic rules can be encoded in a differentiable form, allowing the planner to generate dynamic rewards that guide the RL agent. This creates a feedback loop where the symbolic planner helps the agent learn more efficiently, while the agent's experiences can potentially refine the planning process. The compositional nature of the primitives enables transfer learning and generalization to new tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Differentiable Planning**: Why needed: To integrate symbolic reasoning with gradient-based learning; Quick check: Verify gradients flow through the planning component during backpropagation
- **Reward Shaping**: Why needed: To provide dense feedback in sparse-reward environments; Quick check: Compare learning curves with and without reward shaping
- **Compositional Policies**: Why needed: To enable generalization to unseen tasks; Quick check: Test performance on tasks not seen during training
- **Symbolic Rule Encoding**: Why needed: To capture human prior knowledge in a machine-readable format; Quick check: Validate that rules correctly capture intended task structure
- **Search Strategy Adaptation**: Why needed: To optimize planning efficiency for different task structures; Quick check: Compare DFS vs BFS performance across task types

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Symbolic Rules -> Differentiable Planner -> Dynamic Reward Generator -> RL Agent -> Policy Network

### Critical Path
1. Parse symbolic rules into structured representation
2. Generate dynamic rewards through differentiable planning
3. Train RL agent using shaped rewards
4. Update policy network through gradient descent

### Design Tradeoffs
The approach trades computational complexity (due to differentiable planning) for improved sample efficiency and generalization. The reliance on human-provided symbolic rules is a key constraint - it enables strong guidance but requires domain expertise. The choice between DFS and BFS search strategies involves balancing exploration completeness with computational efficiency.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor performance if symbolic rules are incomplete or incorrect
- Computational bottlenecks if the differentiable planner becomes too complex
- Limited generalization if compositional primitives are not well-designed
- Suboptimal learning if the search strategy doesn't match task structure

### First Experiments
1. Verify gradient flow through the differentiable planner component
2. Test learning performance with synthetic symbolic rules on simple tasks
3. Compare DFS vs BFS strategies on tasks with different structural properties

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the input.

## Limitations
- Scalability to high-dimensional environments and complex symbolic rule sets remains unclear
- Reliance on human-provided symbolic rules requires domain expertise and may not be feasible for all tasks
- Limited exploration of trade-offs between search strategies and their impact on different task complexities
- Computational overhead of the differentiable planner is not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Dylan's ability to improve learning performance on MiniGrid-DoorKey tasks compared to baselines like PPO and A2C.

**Medium Confidence:** Dylan's generalization capabilities to unseen tasks through compositional policy primitives, as this is demonstrated but may not hold in more complex environments.

**Low Confidence:** Scalability to high-dimensional environments and the computational overhead of the differentiable planner, as these aspects are not extensively explored.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Dylan's performance on more complex environments with larger state and action spaces, such as MiniGrid-MultiRoom or Atari games, to assess scalability.
2. Conduct a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the differentiable planner and compare it with the performance gains across different task complexities.
3. Explore the robustness of Dylan when symbolic rules are incomplete or noisy, and investigate methods to automatically learn or refine these rules from data.
