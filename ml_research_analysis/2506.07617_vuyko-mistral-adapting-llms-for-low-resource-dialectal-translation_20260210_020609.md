## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first effort to adapt large language models to the Ukrainian Hutsul dialect, a low-resource and morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. The authors created a parallel corpus of 9,852 Hutsul-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and expanded it with 52,142 synthetic examples using an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline. They fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) using LoRA for standard-to-dialect translation. Evaluation showed that fine-tuned models outperformed the zero-shot GPT-4o baseline across both automatic and LLM-evaluated metrics, with the best Mistral model achieving BLEU of 74.35, chrF++ of 81.89, and a dialectal quality score of 3.60 out of 5.

## Method Summary
The authors created a parallel corpus by extracting grammar rules from a dialectal novel, then using a RAG pipeline to generate synthetic parallel pairs. They filtered these pairs using character-level similarity and word alignment statistics before fine-tuning Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B models with LoRA for standard-to-dialect translation. The models were evaluated using BLEU, chrF++, TER, and GPT-4o-based judgment.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Mistral-7B achieved BLEU 74.35, chrF++ 81.89, and dialectal quality score 3.60 vs GPT-4o baseline (BLEU 56.64, chrF++ 65.90, dialect 3.22)
- LoRA fine-tuning with synthetic augmentation enabled small models to outperform commercial baselines
- All data, models, and code are publicly released

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: RAG-Augmented Synthetic Parallel Corpus Generation
A retrieval-augmented generation pipeline bootstraps dialectal translation data when authentic parallel corpora are scarce. Grammar rules extracted from a dialectal novel are formalized into prompts. A RAG system indexes this corpus using text-embedding-3-large. For each standard Ukrainian sentence, top-3 similar dialectal sentences are retrieved and injected into a GPT-4o prompt alongside transformation rules, producing synthetic Hutsul translations. Core assumption: the dialectal novel contains sufficiently representative phonological, morphological, and lexical patterns to generalize to new sentences via LLM generation.

### Mechanism 2: Alignment-Based Quality Filtering for Synthetic Data
Statistical alignment metrics identify and remove low-quality synthetic pairs before fine-tuning. Generated pairs are filtered using character-level similarity via difflib's SequenceMatcher (threshold ≥ 0.45), and word alignment statistics from fast_align—specifically U-src, U-tgt, and X. Empirical thresholds (U-src < 0.1, U-tgt < 0.1, X < 0.2) remove inconsistent pairs. Core assumption: lower unaligned proportions and fewer crossing alignments indicate higher translation fidelity for closely related language varieties.

### Mechanism 3: LoRA Fine-Tuning with Synthetic Augmentation
Parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning on augmented parallel data enables small (7B) models to outperform zero-shot commercial baselines on dialect translation. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 and LLaMA-3.1 8B are fine-tuned using LoRA for 3 epochs on manual corpus alone and manual + filtered synthetic corpus. Models are evaluated on standard-to-dialect translation using BLEU, chrF++, TER, and GPT-4o-based judgment. Core assumption: LoRA adapters can capture dialect-specific phonological and morphological transformations without full-model retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Why needed here: Core mechanism for synthetic data generation; requires understanding embedding-based retrieval and prompt engineering for dialectal transformation. Quick check question: Given a standard Ukrainian sentence, can you explain how retrieved dialectal examples and grammar rules are combined in the prompt to guide generation?

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA)**: Why needed here: Enables training on limited dialectal data without full model updates; essential for resource-constrained dialect adaptation. Quick check question: What is the difference between LoRA rank and alpha, and how would you adjust them for a morphologically complex dialect?

- **Machine Translation Evaluation for Non-Standard Languages**: Why needed here: Standard metrics penalize valid dialectal variation; understanding BLEU/chrF++/TER limitations and LLM-based judgment is critical for fair evaluation. Quick check question: Why might chrF++ be preferred over BLEU for evaluating Hutsul dialect translations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dialectal novel -> Grammar rule extraction -> RAG indexing (text-embedding-3-large) -> GPT-4o generation -> SequenceMatcher + fast_align filtering -> LoRA fine-tuning (Mistral-7B/LLaMA-3.1-8B) -> BLEU/chrF++/TER/GPT-4o judge evaluation

- **Critical path**: Grammar rule extraction quality -> RAG retrieval relevance -> synthetic pair filtering thresholds -> LoRA fine-tuning data mix -> evaluation metric selection

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Manual-only data: Higher authenticity, limited scale (~9,852 pairs)
  - Manual + synthetic: 6× scale (62,000+ pairs), but domain gaps in modern topics
  - GPT-4o baseline: Strong fluency, weak dialectal accuracy without fine-tuning
  - LLM-based evaluation: Pragmatic substitute for human annotation, but may bias toward standard Ukrainian patterns

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High BLEU + low dialect score: Model generating standard Ukrainian instead of dialect
  - Low chrF++ with high adequacy: Semantic preservation but phonological transformation failures
  - Synthetic data quality issues: Unusual word order, missing dialect-specific morphology, vocabulary hallucination

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablate synthetic data ratio: Train Mistral-7B with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% synthetic data; plot BLEU/chrF++/dialect score to find optimal mix.
  2. Filtering threshold sweep: Vary alignment thresholds (U-src, U-tgt: 0.05–0.2; X: 0.1–0.3) and measure downstream translation quality to validate filtering logic.
  3. Cross-dialect transfer test: Apply the same RAG + LoRA pipeline to another Ukrainian dialect (e.g., Boyko or Lemko) with minimal corpus to assess generalizability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Human evaluation validation**: Does human evaluation confirm the superiority of fine-tuned models over GPT-4o baselines suggested by automatic metrics? The authors note that "human evaluation would provide much more reliable assessments" and that GPT-4o may have preferences aligned with standard Ukrainian.

- **Cross-dialect generalizability**: Can the proposed RAG-based synthetic data pipeline be effectively transferred to other low-resource Ukrainian dialects? The limitations section notes the methods are "tailored to Hutsul" and "extension to other dialects... will require adaptation."

- **Modern domain performance**: How does the model perform on standard-to-dialect translation involving modern domains absent from the training data? The paper notes the synthetic data "lacks modern domains such as aviation, technology, news and politics" and lacks lexical diversity in these areas.

## Limitations

- Synthetic data domain coverage relies heavily on literary sources, potentially limiting performance on modern topics
- GPT-4o-based evaluation lacks human validation and may systematically favor standard Ukrainian patterns
- Methodology generalizability to other dialects is untested and may depend on documentation quality

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Synthetic corpus generation pipeline successfully expanded dataset; fine-tuned models outperform GPT-4o baseline; LoRA fine-tuning is computationally feasible
- **Medium Confidence**: Quality filtering approach effectively removes low-quality pairs; GPT-4o-based evaluation reliably measures dialectal quality; synthetic data maintains dialectal authenticity
- **Low Confidence**: Domain coverage adequacy of synthetic corpus; generalizability to other low-resource dialects; long-term model performance stability

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Distribution Analysis**: Conduct systematic analysis of domain coverage between manual and synthetic corpora using topic modeling or keyword analysis to identify potential domain gaps.

2. **Human Evaluation Validation**: Commission small-scale human evaluation study (10-20 native Hutsul speakers) to validate GPT-4o judge scores and identify systematic biases.

3. **Cross-Dialect Transfer Experiment**: Apply exact methodology to a different Ukrainian dialect (e.g., Boyko or Lemko) with similar-sized manual corpus to assess generalizability and identify dialect-specific factors affecting success.
