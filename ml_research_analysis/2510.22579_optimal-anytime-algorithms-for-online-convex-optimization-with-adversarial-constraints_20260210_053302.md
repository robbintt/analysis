core_contribution: This paper proposes a novel anytime online algorithm for Constrained
  Online Convex Optimization (COCO), where an agent must learn a sequence of adversarial
  convex cost functions while approximately satisfying adversarial online convex constraints.
  The core technical contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to
  keep track of constraint violations, overcoming the monotonicity limitation of prior
  works that used fixed horizon-dependent Lyapunov functions.

# Optimal Anytime Algorithms for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.22579
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22579
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes an anytime algorithm for COCO achieving optimal O(√t) regret and constraint violation without doubling trick

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) problem where an agent must simultaneously minimize adversarial convex costs and satisfy adversarial convex constraints in an online setting. The key challenge is achieving anytime performance - optimal bounds that hold for any time horizon t≥1 - without resorting to the doubling trick, which suffers from multiple restarts and poor practical performance. The authors propose a novel approach using time-varying Lyapunov functions with carefully designed virtual queue dynamics and multiplicative factors to overcome the monotonicity limitations of previous fixed-horizon approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm introduces time-varying Lyapunov functions to track constraint violations, replacing the fixed horizon-dependent Lyapunov functions used in prior work. A critical innovation is the addition of a multiplicative factor in the virtual queue recursion that restores the key monotonicity property needed for anytime guarantees. By defining an appropriate upper bound on cumulative constraint violation, the algorithm achieves optimal O(√t) regret and O(√t) cumulative constraint violation bounds for any time t≥1. The approach naturally extends to dynamic regret and optimistic settings, adapting to unknown parameters without requiring the doubling trick.

## Key Results
- Achieves optimal O(√t) regret and O(√t) cumulative constraint violation bounds for any t≥1
- Eliminates need for doubling trick, avoiding multiple restarts and poor practical performance
- Demonstrates superiority over fixed-horizon baselines and their doubling trick adaptations on online shortest path problems
- Extends naturally to dynamic regret and optimistic settings with adaptive bounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by using time-varying Lyapunov functions with virtual queues that track constraint violations. The key mechanism is the multiplicative factor introduced in the virtual queue recursion, which restores monotonicity properties lost when moving from fixed-horizon to anytime settings. This allows the algorithm to maintain the theoretical guarantees needed for optimal anytime performance while avoiding the computational overhead of the doubling trick.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time-varying Lyapunov functions**: Needed to handle unknown time horizons in anytime settings; quick check: verify the function satisfies required smoothness and growth conditions
- **Virtual queue dynamics**: Core mechanism for tracking constraint violations; quick check: confirm queue updates maintain required monotonicity properties
- **Monotonicity in online optimization**: Essential for bounding cumulative regret and constraint violations; quick check: verify the multiplicative factor preserves this property
- **Doubling trick limitations**: Understanding why multiple restarts hurt practical performance; quick check: compare convergence rates with and without doubling trick
- **Adversarial convex constraints**: Framework for handling worst-case constraint sequences; quick check: validate convexity assumptions hold for specific problem instances

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Decision maker -> Cost/Constraint oracles -> Virtual queue updater -> Lyapunov monitor -> Parameter tuner

**Critical path**: At each time step: receive cost/constraint functions → compute decision using gradient information → update virtual queues with multiplicative factor → check Lyapunov conditions → adjust parameters if needed

**Design tradeoffs**: Time-varying vs fixed Lyapunov functions (flexibility vs complexity), multiplicative factor choice (monotonicity vs sensitivity), parameter adaptation (robustness vs computational overhead)

**Failure signatures**: Constraint violations growing faster than O(√t), regret bounds deteriorating over time, sensitivity to multiplicative factor tuning, convergence issues with non-convex or non-smooth problems

**First experiments**:
1. Implement basic COCO instance with known horizon to verify theoretical bounds match empirical performance
2. Test sensitivity to multiplicative factor choice across different problem scales
3. Compare anytime vs fixed-horizon performance on problems with varying constraint structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Lyapunov-based approach requires careful design of virtual queue dynamics and may be sensitive to implementation details
- Theoretical guarantees assume convex cost functions and constraints with bounded gradients, which may not hold in all practical settings
- Empirical validation is limited to a single online shortest path problem instance, leaving performance in diverse settings unverified

## Confidence
- Confidence in theoretical claims: High given the rigorous proof framework
- Confidence in practical superiority: Medium based on limited empirical validation
- Confidence in generality of approach: Medium due to specific structural assumptions required for the Lyapunov design

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithm on diverse COCO problems beyond shortest path (e.g., online resource allocation, network flow problems) to verify robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the multiplicative factor in virtual queue recursion to assess sensitivity to parameter tuning
3. Compare against alternative anytime approaches that don't use doubling tricks but employ different mechanisms (e.g., adaptive step sizes, restart policies)
