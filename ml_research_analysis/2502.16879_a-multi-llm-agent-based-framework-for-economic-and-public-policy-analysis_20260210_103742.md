# A Multi-LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Economic and Public Policy Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16879
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Multi-LLM-Agent-Based framework maps different LLMs to economic agents for policy analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Multi-LLM-Agent-Based (MLAB) framework that leverages different Large Language Models (LLMs) to represent heterogeneous economic agents. The authors evaluate five LLMs' capabilities in solving two-period consumption allocation problems, finding DeepSeek-V3 performs best with 90.63% accuracy in optimizing consumption choices. When analyzing economic intuition without explicit utility functions, all models demonstrate human-like patterns such as consumption smoothing and intertemporal substitution. The MLAB framework maps these LLMs to educational groups and income brackets, enabling more realistic policy simulations. A case study on interest income taxation reveals that highly educated groups show the strongest tax sensitivity while lower-educated groups demonstrate more stable, conservative responses. The framework offers a novel approach to capturing both economic and cognitive heterogeneity in policy analysis, though the authors note the need for more sophisticated mapping methods as LLM technology advances.

## Method Summary
The MLAB framework assigns different LLMs to represent distinct economic agents based on their capabilities in solving consumption allocation problems. Five LLMs were evaluated on their ability to optimize two-period consumption choices under different interest rate scenarios. The evaluation included both explicit utility function optimization and intuitive economic reasoning without mathematical frameworks. The framework then maps these LLMs to educational levels and income brackets to create a heterogeneous agent population for policy analysis. A case study on interest income taxation was conducted to demonstrate the framework's application in simulating policy impacts across different agent types.

## Key Results
- DeepSeek-V3 achieved 90.63% accuracy in optimizing two-period consumption choices
- All tested LLMs demonstrated human-like economic patterns including consumption smoothing and intertemporal substitution
- Interest income taxation case study showed highly educated groups exhibited strongest tax sensitivity, while lower-educated groups showed more stable, conservative responses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MLAB framework works by leveraging the diverse capabilities of different LLMs to represent economic heterogeneity that traditional agent-based models struggle to capture. Each LLM's unique reasoning patterns and problem-solving approaches can be mapped to different agent types based on educational background, income level, or cognitive characteristics. This approach allows for more nuanced simulations of how different groups might respond to economic policies, as each LLM can be thought of as having its own "economic intuition" that mirrors real-world diversity in decision-making.

## Foundational Learning
- Economic agent heterogeneity: Different agents respond differently to economic policies based on education, income, and cognitive factors
  - Why needed: Traditional models often assume homogeneous agent responses, limiting policy accuracy
  - Quick check: Verify policy impacts vary meaningfully across different agent types in simulations

- LLM reasoning diversity: Different LLMs demonstrate varying strengths in economic reasoning and problem-solving
  - Why needed: Captures the range of human cognitive approaches to economic decisions
  - Quick check: Compare model outputs across multiple LLMs on identical economic problems

- Intertemporal substitution: Agents shift consumption between periods based on relative prices (interest rates)
  - Why needed: Fundamental economic behavior that must be accurately modeled for policy analysis
  - Quick check: Confirm agents increase future consumption when interest rates rise

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data inputs -> LLM evaluation -> Agent mapping -> Policy simulation -> Output analysis

Critical path: Economic problem definition -> LLM capability assessment -> Agent characteristic mapping -> Policy scenario testing -> Result interpretation

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances computational efficiency (using existing LLMs) against potential limitations in capturing complex economic behaviors. Simpler mapping methods enable faster deployment but may miss nuanced agent characteristics.

Failure signatures: 
- LLMs fail to demonstrate basic economic intuition
- Agent mapping produces unrealistic or implausible group behaviors
- Policy simulation results show no meaningful variation across agent types

First experiments:
1. Test LLMs on basic intertemporal consumption problems with varying interest rates
2. Compare LLM responses to established economic models on simple policy scenarios
3. Evaluate the stability of LLM agent mappings across different economic contexts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The authors note the need for more sophisticated mapping methods as LLM technology advances. They highlight the importance of developing better criteria for matching LLM capabilities to economic agent characteristics, particularly as models become more capable and diverse. The framework's generalizability to other economic contexts beyond consumption allocation and taxation scenarios remains an open question.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on current LLM capabilities, which may not fully capture the complexity of real economic agents
- Simplified mapping between LLMs and economic agent characteristics may miss important nuances
- The study focuses on specific consumption allocation problems and taxation scenarios, limiting generalizability to other economic contexts

## Confidence
- High confidence: The experimental results showing DeepSeek-V3's superior performance in optimizing consumption choices and the observed human-like economic patterns across all models
- Medium confidence: The mapping methodology between LLMs and economic agent characteristics, as well as the case study findings on interest income taxation responses
- Low confidence: The generalizability of the framework to other economic scenarios beyond the tested consumption allocation problem and taxation case

## Next Checks
1. Test the MLAB framework on additional economic problems with varying complexity levels to assess its broader applicability
2. Conduct a longitudinal study to evaluate how well the framework's predictions align with actual economic outcomes over time
3. Compare the framework's policy recommendations with those from established economic models and expert consensus in real-world policy scenarios
