# Benchmarking Diarization Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.26177
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26177
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: PyannoteAI achieved best overall performance at 11.2% DER across 196.6 hours spanning five languages

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive benchmark evaluates five state-of-the-art speaker diarization models across four datasets and five languages (English, Mandarin, German, Japanese, Spanish), totaling 196.6 hours of audio. The study compares both open-source and commercial systems including PyannoteAI, DiariZen, Sortformer, and Sortformer v2. PyannoteAI emerges as the top performer with 11.2% DER, while DiariZen provides a competitive open-source alternative at 13.3% DER. Sortformer v2 demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency with 214.3x real-time factor. The analysis reveals that missed speech detection is the dominant error source across all models, particularly in meeting scenarios.

## Method Summary
The evaluation methodology involved systematic testing of five diarization models across standardized datasets with consistent evaluation metrics. Models were assessed using Diarization Error Rate (DER) as the primary performance metric, with additional analysis of computational efficiency through real-time factor measurements. The study spanned four distinct datasets representing diverse acoustic conditions and meeting scenarios, with languages including English, Mandarin, German, Japanese, and Spanish. Cross-lingual performance was analyzed to identify systematic differences in model effectiveness across language families.

## Key Results
- PyannoteAI achieved the best overall performance at 11.2% DER
- DiariZen provided the best open-source alternative at 13.3% DER
- Sortformer v2 demonstrated exceptional computational efficiency with 214.3x real-time factor
- Missed speech detection was identified as the dominant error source across all models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Speaker diarization systems function by processing audio streams to identify speaker segments and assign speaker labels to each segment. The evaluation demonstrates that model performance varies significantly based on architectural approaches to handling speaker embeddings, segmentation, and clustering. PyannoteAI's superior performance suggests effective integration of temporal modeling and speaker embedding extraction. The computational efficiency of Sortformer v2 indicates successful optimization of inference pipelines while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Cross-lingual performance differences point to varying effectiveness of language-specific acoustic modeling and training data coverage.

## Foundational Learning

**Diarization Error Rate (DER)**
- *Why needed*: Standard metric for quantifying diarization accuracy by measuring missed speech, false alarms, and speaker confusion
- *Quick check*: DER = (Missed + False Alarm + Speaker Confusion time) / Total speech time

**Real-time Factor (RTF)**
- *Why needed*: Measures computational efficiency by comparing processing time to audio duration
- *Quick check*: RTF < 1 indicates real-time processing capability

**Speaker Embeddings**
- *Why needed*: Compact representations of speaker characteristics used for segmentation and clustering
- *Quick check*: Embedding dimensionality and extraction method significantly impact diarization quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Audio Input -> Feature Extraction -> Segmentation -> Speaker Embedding Generation -> Clustering -> Diarization Output

**Critical Path**
Feature extraction and speaker embedding generation represent the most computationally intensive stages, followed by clustering operations. Models with optimized embedding generation (like Sortformer v2) achieve superior computational efficiency.

**Design Tradeoffs**
Accuracy vs. computational efficiency represents the primary tradeoff, with PyannoteAI prioritizing accuracy while Sortformer v2 emphasizes speed. Open-source models must balance performance with deployment complexity and resource requirements.

**Failure Signatures**
Missed speech detection dominates failure modes across all models, particularly in meeting scenarios with overlapping speakers or background noise. Cross-lingual performance degradation suggests limitations in acoustic modeling generalization.

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Test baseline performance on single-speaker clean audio to establish upper performance bounds
2. Evaluate on overlapping speech scenarios to assess handling of simultaneous speakers
3. Compare performance across varying noise levels to identify robustness limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to four datasets despite spanning five languages
- Computational efficiency comparisons rely on theoretical RT factors without practical deployment constraints
- Cross-lingual performance analysis lacks investigation into specific linguistic or acoustic features driving differences

## Confidence
High confidence in comparative performance rankings due to consistent DER measurements across multiple datasets and languages. Medium confidence in cross-lingual generalization claims due to limited investigation of underlying factors. Low confidence in real-world deployment recommendations based solely on theoretical computational metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extended evaluations on additional datasets with diverse acoustic conditions, including varying noise levels, reverberation, and overlapping speech scenarios
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of linguistic features versus acoustic characteristics on cross-lingual performance differences
3. Implement real-world deployment testing measuring actual memory consumption, inference latency under GPU constraints, and integration overhead
