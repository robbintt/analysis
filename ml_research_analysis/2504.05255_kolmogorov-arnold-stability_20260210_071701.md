core_contribution: This paper investigates the stability of the Kolmogorov-Arnold
  (KA) representation theorem under re-parameterizations of the hidden layer in neural
  networks. The authors frame this as testing whether KA can withstand adversarial
  re-parameterizations that attempt to foil the construction of the KA outer function.

# Kolmogorov--Arnold stability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.05255
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05255
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Key outcome:** KA representation theorem remains stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations, but faces obstruction with continuous groups

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the stability of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem when the hidden layer of a neural network undergoes re-parameterization. The authors frame this as testing whether KA can withstand adversarial re-parameterizations that attempt to foil the construction of the KA outer function. They prove that KA remains stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations, but encounter an obstruction when dealing with continuous groups of re-parameterizations. The main obstacle is the failure of equi-continuity of the outer functions across the collection of re-parameterizations.

## Method Summary
The authors approach the problem by examining how the KA representation theorem behaves under different types of re-parameterizations of the hidden layer. They analyze both single homeomorphisms and multiple homeomorphisms acting on different inner functions. The key insight is recognizing that the main obstruction to stability comes from the failure of equi-continuity when dealing with continuous groups of re-parameterizations, rather than countable collections.

## Key Results
- KA representation theorem remains stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations
- Failure of equi-continuity emerges as the main obstruction for continuous groups of re-parameterizations
- Two main theorems are proven: one for single homeomorphisms and another for multiple homeomorphisms acting on different inner functions
- The transition from countable collections to group actions remains an open problem

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The stability of KA representation under re-parameterizations depends on the topological properties of the re-parameterization functions and their impact on the outer functions. For countable collections, the authors can leverage compactness arguments and equi-continuity properties. However, when dealing with continuous groups, the failure of equi-continuity becomes the fundamental obstruction, preventing the extension of stability results.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem** - Why needed: Forms the basis for understanding neural network expressivity; Quick check: Can represent any continuous function of several variables as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable.

2. **Homeomorphisms and re-parameterizations** - Why needed: Understanding how transformations of the hidden layer affect the overall network representation; Quick check: Verify continuity and bijectivity of proposed re-parameterizations.

3. **Equi-continuity** - Why needed: Critical for understanding the obstruction when dealing with continuous groups; Quick check: Test whether a family of functions is equi-continuous on a given domain.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** KA theorem -> Hidden layer re-parameterization -> Outer function construction -> Stability analysis

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves establishing the existence of outer functions that can compensate for re-parameterizations while maintaining the overall representation. This requires careful analysis of continuity properties and topological constraints.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The tradeoff between generality of re-parameterizations (countable collections vs. groups) and the ability to prove stability. More restrictive conditions on re-parameterizations allow for stronger stability guarantees.

**Failure Signatures:** Loss of equi-continuity in the family of outer functions, inability to construct compensating outer functions for certain re-parameterizations, and failure of compactness arguments when moving from countable to uncountable collections.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test KA stability with simple continuous re-parameterizations on toy functions
2. Verify the equi-continuity obstruction by constructing explicit counterexamples
3. Compare stability results for countable vs. continuous collections of re-parameterizations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper raises several open questions about extending the stability results:
- Can the stability results be extended to entire homeomorphism groups?
- What happens when re-parameterizations act after summation rather than on individual components?
- Is there a computable characterization of functions implementable by neural networks with a single hidden layer under these conditions?

## Limitations

- The stability results do not extend to continuous groups of re-parameterizations due to equi-continuity failure
- The paper focuses on theoretical properties without addressing practical implementation considerations
- Computability questions remain largely unexplored and speculative

## Confidence

- **Main theoretical results:** Medium confidence
- **Proof techniques for countable case:** High confidence
- **Transition to group actions:** Low confidence
- **Computability claims:** Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. Verify the equi-continuity arguments for the countable collection case with explicit counterexamples
2. Test the stability results with numerical implementations of KA networks under adversarial re-parameterizations
3. Investigate whether the equi-continuity obstruction persists when considering compact subsets of homeomorphism groups
