# Enhancing Technical Documents Retrieval for RAG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.04139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04139
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Technical-Embeddings enhances semantic retrieval in technical documentation by integrating synthetic query generation, contextual summarization, and prompt tuning, achieving superior performance on RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA datasets.

## Executive Summary
Technical-Embeddings is a method designed to improve semantic retrieval for technical documentation within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It addresses the challenge of retrieving relevant documents from large, complex technical corpora by leveraging synthetic query generation, document summarization, and prompt tuning of a bi-encoder model. The approach is evaluated on two datasets—RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA—and demonstrates significant gains in precision and recall compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The method integrates three key components: synthetic query generation using LLMs, document summarization via instruction-tuned models, and soft prompt tuning of a bi-encoder BERT model. Synthetic queries are generated from document titles or user queries, enabling diverse training examples. Summaries are extracted from documents to reduce noise and focus on core content. The bi-encoder is fine-tuned with contrastive learning using both synthetic and natural queries, leveraging soft prompting to adapt the model to technical semantics. This combination improves retrieval accuracy by aligning queries and documents in a shared embedding space tailored for technical content.

## Key Results
- On Rust-Docs-QA, MAP of 0.2238 and MRR of 0.2249 achieved.
- On RAG-EDA, MAP and MRR of 0.6926 with recall of 0.8111.
- Significant performance improvements over baseline models in both precision and recall.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by enriching the training data with synthetic queries that capture diverse ways users might express technical information needs. Summarization reduces noise by focusing embeddings on core document content, while prompt tuning adapts the bi-encoder to better understand technical semantics. The contrastive learning framework ensures that relevant documents are mapped close to their queries in the embedding space, improving retrieval relevance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic Query Generation**: Creating diverse training queries using LLMs to cover multiple expressions of information needs. Needed to broaden model exposure beyond natural queries; check by measuring query diversity.
- **Document Summarization**: Extracting concise, relevant summaries to reduce noise in embeddings. Needed to focus model on core content; check by comparing retrieval performance with/without summarization.
- **Soft Prompt Tuning**: Adapting a frozen BERT encoder with trainable soft prompts for task-specific semantics. Needed to efficiently specialize embeddings for technical content; check by ablation of prompt tuning.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Training embeddings so relevant query-document pairs are close, irrelevant pairs are far. Needed to shape embedding space for retrieval; check by evaluating embedding distances.
- **Bi-Encoder Architecture**: Encoding queries and documents separately for scalable retrieval. Needed for efficient large-scale search; check by measuring inference latency.
- **Evaluation Metrics (MAP, MRR, Recall)**: Measuring retrieval quality via ranking-based and recall metrics. Needed to quantify performance; check by confirming metric definitions.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Query/Document Encoder (BERT) <- Soft Prompts <- Prompt Tuner; Synthetic Query Generator (LLM); Summarizer (Instruct-tuned LLM); Contrastive Loss Trainer
- **Critical Path**: Document → Summarizer → Encoder (with soft prompts) → Embedding → Index; Query → Synthetic Generator (optional) → Encoder (with soft prompts) → Embedding → Retrieval
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using soft prompts preserves BERT's general knowledge while adapting to technical semantics; summarization reduces noise but may lose detail; synthetic queries increase diversity but risk introducing bias.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval if synthetic queries are unrepresentative; summarization may omit critical details; soft prompts may not generalize beyond training domain.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Ablation: retrieve with and without summarization to measure noise reduction impact. 2) Ablation: retrieve with and without synthetic queries to measure diversity impact. 3) Ablation: retrieve with and without soft prompt tuning to measure adaptation impact.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to specific technical domains and curated datasets, raising generalizability concerns.
- Synthetic query generation and summarization may miss domain-specific nuances not captured in training data.
- No computational overhead or inference time reported, limiting assessment of real-world deployment feasibility.

## Confidence
- High confidence: Retrieval performance improvements on RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA datasets.
- Medium confidence: Generalizability of Technical-Embeddings to other technical domains or less curated datasets.
- Medium confidence: The robustness of synthetic query generation and summarization in capturing complex technical semantics.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Technical-Embeddings on a broader set of technical documentation, including less structured or multi-modal sources, to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (synthetic queries, summarization, prompt tuning) to overall performance.
3. Measure and report computational overhead, including inference time and resource usage, to assess practical deployment feasibility.
