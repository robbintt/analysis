core_contribution: Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS) addresses the problem
  of indiscriminate activation steering that degrades model performance when applied
  uniformly. The core method idea is to adaptively modulate steering strength based
  on context, learning when to steer rather than applying fixed policies.

# Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03661
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03661
- Reference count: 40
- Dynamically modulates steering strength per token to improve activation steering's Pareto front between toxicity mitigation and capability retention

## Executive Summary
Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS) addresses the key limitation of standard activation steering—its uniform, fixed-strength application—which often degrades model performance when applied indiscriminately. DSAS introduces a context-aware mechanism that adaptively modulates steering strength per token based on whether the current context requires intervention. By training logistic regressors to predict per-token intervention strength from source vs. control embeddings, DSAS steers strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. This dynamic approach consistently improves the trade-off between reducing toxicity and preserving capabilities, outperforming both vanilla steering and recent conditional methods like CAST and MERA.

## Method Summary
DSAS dynamically modulates steering strength by training per-layer logistic regressors that predict per-token intervention strength from source vs. control embeddings. The method applies PCA (5 components) on average embeddings from source and control activations, then trains a logistic regressor to output a per-token weight. This weight modulates the base steering direction, allowing strong intervention only when undesired behavior is detected. DSAS can be applied to any steering method and introduces minimal computational overhead. The approach is validated on LLMs for toxicity mitigation (Qwen 2.5, 1.5B) and text-to-image diffusion models for concept blurring, consistently improving the Pareto front between task performance and capability retention.

## Key Results
- DSAS-enhanced CAA reduces toxicity from 12.1% to 8.64% on Qwen 2.5 (1.5B) while maintaining MMLU accuracy at 59.84%
- DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front between toxicity reduction and capability retention across all tested steering methods (CAA, ITI, LinEAS)
- DSAS generalizes to text-to-image diffusion models, selectively blurring target concepts while preserving non-target content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DSAS works by replacing the fixed-strength steering of traditional methods with a context-aware, per-token modulation. Instead of applying the same steering vector strength everywhere, DSAS uses a learned classifier to decide when and how much to steer each token. This allows the model to intervene strongly only when undesired behavior is detected (e.g., toxic content) while leaving safe contexts untouched, preserving model capabilities. The logistic regressor outputs a weight between 0 and 1 for each token, which modulates the base steering direction, effectively creating a dynamic Pareto front between task performance and capability retention.

## Foundational Learning

**PCA Dimensionality Reduction**
- Why needed: Reduces high-dimensional activation space to a tractable number of components for classifier training
- Quick check: Verify variance explained by top 5 components is substantial (>80%)

**Logistic Regression for Token Classification**
- Why needed: Learns to distinguish source (toxic) from control (safe) activations at token level
- Quick check: Per-layer classifier accuracy should exceed 0.5 significantly before applying DSAS

**Activation Steering**
- Why needed: Baseline method that modifies model activations to change behavior
- Quick check: Verify steering direction correctly reduces target behavior in controlled settings

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
RTP Data -> PCA Reduction -> Logistic Regressor -> Per-Token Weight -> Steering Modulation -> Model Output

**Critical Path**
Average source/control embeddings -> PCA (r=5) -> Logistic regression training -> Per-token weight computation -> Adaptive steering application

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Fixed vs. adaptive steering strength: DSAS sacrifices simplicity for improved Pareto efficiency
- Classifier accuracy vs. steering strength: Lower accuracy leads to near-random steering weights

**Failure Signatures**
- Classifier accuracy near 0.5 indicates DSAS will produce uniform ~0.5 weights, degenerating to half-strength vanilla steering
- Using λ=1 with DSAS produces weaker-than-expected steering because it only steers "toxic" embeddings

**First Experiments**
1. Train logistic regressor on 32 toxic vs 32 non-toxic (control) embeddings, verify accuracy > 0.7
2. Apply DSAS with CAA at λ=2, measure ToxTET vs MMLU compared to vanilla CAA
3. Test DSAS on text-to-image diffusion model for selective concept blurring

## Next Checks
1. **Verify classifier conditioning**: Train DSAS logistic regressors on provided RTP splits, measure per-layer cross-validation accuracy, ensure it exceeds 0.5 before applying DSAS
2. **Reproduce Pareto front positioning**: Apply DSAS-enhanced steering (e.g., CAA, LinEAS) on Qwen 2.5 (1.5B) at λ∈[0,2], measure ToxTET, PPLWik, and MMLU, compare to paper's results
3. **Test edge cases and generalization**: Evaluate DSAS with extreme λ values (e.g., λ>2) and on steering methods or datasets not covered in the paper, assess robustness and performance breakdown
