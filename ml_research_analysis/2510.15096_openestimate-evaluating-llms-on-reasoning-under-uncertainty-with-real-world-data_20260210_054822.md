# OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15096
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs elicit priors that are often inaccurate and overconfident when reasoning under uncertainty with real-world data

## Executive Summary
OpenEstimate is a novel benchmark for evaluating language models on reasoning under uncertainty using real-world data. The benchmark constructs derived variables from public datasets (Glassdoor, Pitchbook, NHANES) and asks models to express beliefs as Bayesian priors, parameterized as Gaussian or Beta distributions. Across six frontier models, the study finds that elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident, with performance no better than sampling five data points from the true distribution. Performance varies by domain and is largely unaffected by changes in temperature, reasoning effort, or prompt design.

## Method Summary
The OpenEstimate benchmark presents language models with questions about derived variables from real-world datasets, asking them to express their beliefs as Bayesian priors. Models are prompted to parameterize these priors as either Gaussian or Beta distributions. The benchmark evaluates model performance using two metrics: accuracy (measured as error ratio relative to statistical baselines) and calibration (measured as quartile expected calibration error). The study tests six frontier language models across different domains including salary, startup funding, and health biomarkers, systematically varying temperature settings, reasoning effort, and prompt designs to assess their impact on performance.

## Key Results
- Elicited priors from LLMs are often inaccurate and overconfident, with error ratios no better than five samples from the true distribution
- Performance varies significantly across domains but is largely unaffected by temperature, reasoning effort, or prompt design
- Models struggle to produce well-calibrated probabilistic estimates even with reasoning-focused prompting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark leverages real-world datasets to create realistic uncertainty reasoning scenarios that go beyond synthetic distributions. By asking models to express beliefs as explicit probability distributions rather than point estimates, it captures both the model's central tendency estimates and their uncertainty quantification. The use of public datasets ensures reproducibility while the derived variables provide sufficient complexity to challenge model reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian inference: Understanding how to update beliefs based on evidence is crucial for interpreting the benchmark's evaluation of prior elicitation
  - Why needed: The benchmark specifically asks models to express Bayesian priors
  - Quick check: Can the reader explain the difference between priors and posteriors?

- Probability distribution parameterization: Knowledge of how to specify distributions using parameters like mean/variance or alpha/beta
  - Why needed: Models must translate their beliefs into mathematical distribution parameters
  - Quick check: Can the reader identify appropriate distributions for different types of data?

- Expected calibration error: Understanding how to measure the alignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes
  - Why needed: The benchmark uses calibration error as a key evaluation metric
  - Quick check: Can the reader explain what it means for a model to be well-calibrated?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Dataset -> Question Generation -> Prompt Template -> Language Model -> Parameter Extraction -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical path: Real-world dataset → Derived variable questions → Model prior elicitation → Parameter extraction → Accuracy and calibration evaluation

Design tradeoffs: The benchmark trades breadth of distribution types (limiting to Gaussian and Beta) for focus on reasoning quality, and uses prompting rather than fine-tuning to maintain accessibility while potentially underestimating model capabilities.

Failure signatures: Poor performance manifests as overconfident priors with large error ratios, particularly in domains with complex underlying distributions or when the true distribution doesn't match the requested parameterization.

Three first experiments:
1. Test model performance on simple synthetic distributions before moving to real-world data
2. Compare prompted responses against sampling-based baselines on the same datasets
3. Evaluate the impact of providing additional context or examples in prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges uncertainty about whether the selected domains adequately represent the breadth of real-world uncertainty reasoning scenarios. There is also uncertainty about whether limiting priors to Gaussian or Beta distributions captures the full complexity of real-world distributions. Additionally, the reliance on prompting rather than fine-tuning may underestimate models' true capabilities for uncertainty reasoning.

## Limitations
- The benchmark's effectiveness depends on the quality and representativeness of publicly available datasets
- Limiting prior parameterization to Gaussian and Beta distributions may not capture complex real-world distributions
- The use of prompting rather than fine-tuning may underestimate models' true uncertainty reasoning capabilities

## Confidence
High confidence: Models produce inaccurate and overconfident priors; performance varies by domain; prompting changes have minimal impact.

Medium confidence: The benchmark provides a challenging evaluation; results suggest limitations in current models' uncertainty reasoning.

Low confidence: Broader implications for model development and impact on the field of uncertainty reasoning in LLMs.

## Next Checks
1. Expand the benchmark to include more diverse real-world domains and distribution types beyond Gaussian and Beta to test the generality of the findings.

2. Conduct a comparative study between prompted models and fine-tuned models on the same tasks to assess whether fine-tuning significantly improves uncertainty reasoning performance.

3. Investigate the relationship between model size, pretraining data diversity, and performance on OpenEstimate to better understand which factors contribute to improved uncertainty reasoning capabilities.
