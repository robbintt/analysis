# Hybrid Generative Modeling for Incomplete Physics: Deep Grey-Box Meets Optimal Transport

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.22204
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22204
- Reference count: 28
- The authors propose a hybrid generative modeling approach that combines deep grey-box modeling with Optimal Transport methods to complete incomplete physics models using unpaired data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of completing incomplete physics models using unpaired data, where simulations from imperfect models differ from real-world observations. The authors propose a hybrid generative modeling approach that combines deep grey-box modeling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods. Their method learns conditional optimal stochastic maps between source (model) and target (data) distributions while preserving the structure of the input samples with minimal change.

The core contribution is integrating OT maps in data space with grey-box models that explicitly incorporate known physics dynamics. This ensures correct usage of physics parameters while maintaining interpretability. The approach is evaluated on several physics tasks including damped pendulum, reaction diffusion, and advection diffusion systems, comparing grey-box models against black-box alternatives.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines deep grey-box modeling with Optimal Transport to learn conditional mappings between incomplete physics model simulations and real-world data. The approach uses grey-box models that explicitly incorporate known physics dynamics while learning optimal transport maps to align distributions. The framework preserves physical interpretability by maintaining the structure of input samples while learning stochastic mappings. The method operates in an unpaired setting, requiring only access to both model simulations and real data without needing direct correspondences between samples.

## Key Results
- OT grey-box models significantly outperform black-box models on joint evaluation metrics (MMD, C2ST, N-RMSE), particularly in stochastic settings
- The method demonstrates superior ability to learn conditional mappings while preserving physical interpretability
- Component analysis reveals that grey-box models maintain smooth dynamics and stable predictions, whereas black-box models can produce physically implausible trajectories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the complementary strengths of Optimal Transport and grey-box modeling. OT provides principled tools for learning conditional optimal stochastic maps between distributions while minimizing structural changes to input samples. Grey-box models incorporate explicit physics knowledge into the learning process, ensuring that the learned mappings respect physical constraints and maintain interpretability. The combination allows the model to benefit from both the flexibility of data-driven learning and the structure of domain knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- Optimal Transport: Needed for principled distribution alignment and learning conditional mappings. Quick check: Verify that transport plans satisfy marginal constraints.
- Grey-box modeling: Combines physics-based models with data-driven components. Quick check: Ensure physics equations are correctly embedded in the architecture.
- Unpaired learning: Works with two datasets without direct correspondences. Quick check: Validate that learned mappings work across the full data distribution.
- Conditional stochastic mapping: Learns probability distributions over outputs given inputs. Quick check: Test distributional consistency through multiple forward passes.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Physics dynamics -> Grey-box model -> OT transport -> Output mapping

Critical path: Input → Grey-box physics encoder → Optimal transport alignment → Stochastic output generation

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational efficiency for physical interpretability and theoretical guarantees. Grey-box components provide structure but reduce flexibility compared to fully black-box approaches.

Failure signatures: Black-box models may produce physically implausible trajectories; OT component may struggle with high-dimensional data; insufficient data coverage may limit mapping accuracy.

First experiments:
1. Test on simple pendulum system with known dynamics
2. Compare grey-box vs black-box performance on deterministic case
3. Validate OT alignment on toy distribution matching problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational cost of OT-based approach increases with data dimensionality and dataset size
- Dependence on having access to both imperfect model simulations and real data for training
- Effectiveness depends on quality and quantity of available unpaired data

## Confidence
High: OT grey-box models outperform black-box alternatives on joint evaluation metrics in tested physics systems
Medium: Generalizability of results to other scientific domains
Low: Scalability claims for high-dimensional data without further empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test computational scalability on higher-dimensional physics systems (5+ dimensions) and report wall-clock training times compared to black-box alternatives
2. Evaluate performance on real-world datasets from different scientific domains (e.g., climate modeling, fluid dynamics) with varying levels of model incompleteness
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the OT component versus the grey-box physics modeling in isolation
