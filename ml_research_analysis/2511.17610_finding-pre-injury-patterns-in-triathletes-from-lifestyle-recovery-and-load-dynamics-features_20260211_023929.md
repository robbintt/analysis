# Finding Pre-Injury Patterns in Triathletes from Lifestyle, Recovery and Load Dynamics Features

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.17610
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17610
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Machine learning models trained on synthetic data achieve AUC scores up to 0.86 for predicting injury risk in triathletes.

## Executive Summary
This study develops a synthetic data generation framework to predict injury risk in triathletes by integrating training load, recovery, and lifestyle factors. The framework generates physiologically realistic athlete profiles and simulates periodized training plans, producing wearable device-style data streams including heart rate variability, sleep metrics, and stress indicators. Machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on this synthetic dataset achieve strong predictive performance, with recovery-related metrics identified as the strongest injury risk predictors.

## Method Summary
The approach generates synthetic triathlete data using a rule-based simulation framework that creates physiologically plausible athlete profiles with 24 parameters, applies periodized 52-week training plans following load-management principles, and injects injury events preceded by 7-14 day physiological degradation patterns. The synthetic dataset includes labeled wearable-style data streams with heart rate variability, sleep quality, and stress metrics. Machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, XGBoost) are trained on over 100 engineered features including rolling statistics and interaction terms, achieving AUC scores up to 0.86 while identifying key injury risk predictors.

## Key Results
- XGBoost model achieves AUC of 0.858 and AP of 0.726 on synthetic data
- Recovery-related metrics (sleep quality, HRV, stress) are strongest predictors of injury risk
- Training load indicators show weaker predictive power compared to recovery metrics
- Temporal feature engineering (rolling statistics, interaction terms) enables detection of subtle pre-injury patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic data generation can substitute for scarce real-world injury datasets while preserving predictive signal for machine learning models.
- Mechanism: A rule-based simulation framework generates physiologically plausible athlete profiles with 24 parameters, applies periodized 52-week training plans following established load-management principles, and injects injury events preceded by 7-14 day physiological degradation patterns (HRV decline, RHR elevation, sleep disruption). This produces labeled wearable-style data streams that encode consistent injury patterns detectable by multiple ML algorithms.
- Core assumption: The physiological relationships encoded in the simulation (e.g., HRV-sleep-stress interdependencies, load-recovery dynamics) accurately reflect real athlete physiology, and injury precursors follow predictable temporal trajectories.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach overcomes privacy constraints in sports data collection while enabling development of holistic, context-aware athlete monitoring systems."
  - [Section III-A-4] "Each athlete receives 4–6 pattern-based injuries annually. These are preceded by physiological degradations across HRV, resting HR, and sleep quality within a 7–14 day window."
  - [corpus] FLOW dataset (arXiv:2512.22956) demonstrates synthetic longitudinal data generation for wellbeing modeling under privacy constraints, supporting the feasibility of this approach.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Recovery-related metrics (sleep quality, HRV, stress) are stronger predictors of injury risk than training load metrics alone.
- Mechanism: Recovery indicators capture the body's adaptive capacity. When sleep quality declines, HRV drops, and stress rises concurrently, autonomic nervous system regulation is compromised, reducing the tolerance for training load. The models learn that compound degradation patterns—not isolated load spikes—signal elevated injury probability.
- Core assumption: The correlation structure between recovery metrics and injury in the synthetic data reflects causal or at least predictive relationships in real athletes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Key injury risk predictors identified include sleep disturbances, heart rate variability trends, and stress levels."
  - [Section IV-D] "Recovery-related metrics consistently ranked as the most important predictors of injury risk, while training load indicators were absent. LASSO emphasized linear associations, with REM sleep and deep sleep deviation showing the highest weights."
  - [corpus] TILES-2018 Sleep Benchmark Dataset demonstrates sleep behavior modeling in high-stress populations, supporting sleep as a predictive health signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal feature engineering (rolling statistics, interaction terms) enables ML models to detect subtle pre-injury patterns invisible in daily snapshots.
- Mechanism: Raw daily metrics are transformed into 100+ features including rolling min/max/mean/slope across 3/7/14-day windows, acute-to-chronic workload ratios, and compound features (e.g., Sleep×HRV, Stress×Load). These features capture trajectory and interaction effects that single-day values miss.
- Core assumption: The 3/7/14-day windows align with physiological adaptation timescales, and the engineered interactions represent meaningful physiological coupling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section III-B-2] "Over 100 features are derived from daily and rolling statistics... Recovery ratios: current HRV divided by athlete baseline. Risk markers: Acute-Chronic Workload Ratio, load spikes, monotony, strain."
  - [Section IV-B-2] "Around seven days before injury, distinct physiological changes emerge... HRV exhibits a biphasic pattern with supranormal levels between days 14–8, followed by a steady decline toward injury."
  - [corpus] Personalized Counterfactual Framework (arXiv:2508.14432) uses multivariate wearable data for personalized modeling, supporting temporal feature extraction approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**
  - Why needed here: HRV is the primary recovery indicator in the framework. Understanding that higher HRV generally indicates better parasympathetic nervous system activity and recovery readiness is essential for interpreting feature importance results.
  - Quick check question: If an athlete's HRV drops 15% below their baseline for 3 consecutive days, what might this signal about their injury risk?

- Concept: **Training Stress Score (TSS) and Periodization**
  - Why needed here: The simulation builds training plans around TSS targets and periodization phases (Base, Build, Peak, Taper). Understanding load quantification is necessary to interpret ACWR and training progression features.
  - Quick check question: Why might a 10% weekly TSS increase cap reduce injury risk compared to unstructured load progression?

- Concept: **Acute-to-Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)**
  - Why needed here: ACWR is a key risk marker feature. The "safe zone" (0.8-1.3) and "danger zone" (>1.5) are physiological thresholds the simulation enforces and the models learn from.
  - Quick check question: An athlete with ACWR of 1.6 has been training safely at 1.0 for months. What changed, and why does this elevate injury risk?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Synthetic Data Generator -> ML Pipeline -> Model Training -> Evaluation
- Critical path:
  1. Define athlete profile distributions (Table II parameters must be physiologically plausible)
  2. Generate periodized training plans (TSS progression capped at 10%, recovery weeks every 4th week)
  3. Simulate daily physiology with realistic deviations based on fatigue/HRV
  4. Inject injury patterns with 7-14 day precursor degradation
  5. Engineer features with rolling windows and interaction terms
  6. Train models with class weighting for imbalance handling
  7. Evaluate on held-out athletes AND held-out time periods

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Synthetic realism vs. simplicity**: More complex physiological relationships increase plausibility but risk encoding incorrect assumptions. Current approach uses established literature but may miss edge cases.
  - **Feature count vs. interpretability**: 100+ features improve predictive power but complicate model interpretation. LASSO provides sparse selection; Random Forest/XGBoost sacrifice some interpretability for non-linearity.
  - **Athlete-based vs. time-based validation**: Athlete-based tests generalization to new individuals; time-based tests temporal robustness. Both are needed.

- Failure signatures:
  - Models achieve high AUC on synthetic data but <0.65 on real data → simulation-reality gap in physiological relationships
  - Training load features appear in top importance despite weak correlation → overfitting to synthetic noise patterns
  - Time-based AUC significantly lower than athlete-based AUC → temporal drift or overfitting to specific seasonal patterns
  - High false positive rate on "false-alarm" periods → insufficient distinction between warning signals and actual injury precursors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Train each model (LASSO, RF, XGBoost) on synthetic data with athlete-based split. Verify AUC matches reported values (0.85+). Inspect feature importance—confirm recovery metrics dominate.
  2. **Ablation study**: Remove one feature category at a time (sleep features, HRV features, interaction terms). Measure AUC degradation to identify critical feature groups.
  3. **Temporal robustness test**: Train on months 1-10, test on months 11-12. Compare athlete-based vs. time-based performance gaps. If gap >5%, investigate seasonal pattern overfitting.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can predictive models trained on this synthetic framework generalize effectively to real-world triathlon datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V states future work will "validate the synthetic framework against real-world data."
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation relies entirely on simulated data; the authors acknowledge that "systematic differences" between simulated and actual measurements could degrade performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing model performance (AUC, AP) when trained on synthetic data and tested on a held-out set of real athlete wearable data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do unmodeled environmental factors and device-specific measurement characteristics hinder the deployment of these models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section IV.E notes these factors are not accounted for in the simulation and could lead to "degraded model performance."
- Why unresolved: The simulation assumes standardized physiological responses, ignoring variability introduced by different wearable vendors or external conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of model robustness across data collected from different wearable device brands and varying training environments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the physiological realism of the injury simulation be refined to capture more subtle or complex relationships?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V lists "refine physiological realism" as a goal; Section IV.E admits some physiological relationships may be "oversimplified."
- Why unresolved: The current injury injection mechanism uses defined patterns (e.g., HRV decline) which may not capture the full stochasticity or heterogeneity of real injury progression.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating that the synthetic data can replicate specific non-linear biomarker interactions observed in clinical sports science literature.

## Limitations
- All validation performed on synthetic data with no real-world performance testing
- Simulation assumes predictable 7-14 day pre-injury degradation patterns that may not reflect all injury types
- Does not account for environmental factors or device-specific measurement characteristics that could affect model deployment

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Synthetic data generation framework is well-specified with clear parameters and periodization rules
- **Medium confidence**: Recovery metrics as stronger predictors than training load supported by synthetic data but unproven on real data
- **Low confidence**: Claims about model generalizability to real athletes and absolute predictive performance (AUC 0.86) are unsupported without external validation

## Next Checks
1. **Simulation-reality gap analysis**: Compare key synthetic data distributions (HRV baseline, sleep patterns, stress levels) against published real athlete datasets to quantify physiological plausibility.
2. **Controlled ablation on real data**: Apply the trained models to a small cohort of real triathletes with known injury histories. Measure performance degradation to estimate the synthetic-real gap.
3. **Temporal pattern validation**: Analyze whether the 7-14 day pre-injury degradation patterns observed in synthetic data manifest in real athlete longitudinal data, or if real injury precursors follow different temporal signatures.
