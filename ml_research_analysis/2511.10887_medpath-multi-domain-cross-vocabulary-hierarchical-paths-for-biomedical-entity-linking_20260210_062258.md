# MedPath: Multi-Domain Cross-Vocabulary Hierarchical Paths for Biomedical Entity Linking

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.10887
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10887
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Consolidated multi-domain dataset improves biomedical entity linking generalization across semantic types

## Executive Summary
MedPath addresses semantic fragmentation in biomedical entity linking by consolidating nine expert-annotated corpora across clinical notes, literature, social media, and drug labels into a unified dataset with over 500,000 mentions. The key innovation is normalizing all entities to UMLS CUIs and mapping them to 62 biomedical vocabularies while providing full hierarchical paths in 11 vocabularies. This enables training and evaluation of interpretable, vocabulary-agnostic EL systems that consistently outperform models trained on individual datasets or single domains. Experiments show that hierarchical evaluation metrics reveal ~17% of "errors" are actually semantically related predictions.

## Method Summary
MedPath employs a four-stage pipeline to transform disparate biomedical entity linking datasets into a unified resource. First, dataset-specific parsers convert source formats (BRAT, PubTator, XML, TSV) to a standardized JSON schema. Second, a canonicalization module maps all native concept IDs to UMLS CUIs using dictionary lookup with fallback heuristics (exact string match, then bidirectional substring containment). Third, semantic enrichment extracts TUIs and cross-vocabulary code mappings via UMLS atoms. Finally, hierarchical path extractors traverse 11 vocabularies' ontologies from entity to root, capturing all paths including multiple inheritance cases. The resulting dataset includes unified documents, cross-vocabulary mappings, and hierarchical annotations stored in efficient separate files.

## Key Results
- Models trained on consolidated MedPath consistently outperform those trained on individual datasets or single domains across all semantic types
- Hierarchical evaluation metrics show ~17% improvement over flat accuracy, indicating semantic relatedness of "errors"
- TF-IDF retrieval excels at Acc@1 (51.5%) while SapBERT retrieval excels at Acc@32 (73.7%), suggesting complementary retrieval strategies
- Cross-vocabulary mapping coverage enables 98.7% of mentions to be annotated with hierarchical paths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Unified UMLS canonicalization enables pooling of supervision across fragmented datasets, improving model generalization beyond single-vocabulary training.
- **Mechanism:** A four-stage pipeline converts disparate source formats to a standardized JSON schema, then maps all native concept IDs to canonical UMLS CUIs using dictionary lookup with fallback heuristics (exact string match, then bidirectional substring containment). This allows models to treat entities from different BioKGs as semantically equivalent during training.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that UMLS atom-level mappings are sufficiently complete to preserve semantic equivalence across vocabularies. Loss of ~2.5% of unique mentions during mapping (Section 3.2) is acceptable noise.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies"
  - [section 3.2, Stage 2] "we normalized all concept IDs from their native BioKG to the latest Unified Medical Language System (UMLS 2025AA) release"
  - [corpus] SynCABEL addresses BEL data scarcity through synthetic augmentation rather than consolidation—suggesting complementary approaches to the same bottleneck.
- **Break condition:** If target vocabularies contain substantial concepts absent from UMLS, or if UMLS version drifts significantly from source dataset annotation dates, canonicalization quality degrades. Users requiring vocabularies with poor UMLS coverage will see limited benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Hierarchical path annotations enable evaluation metrics that provide partial credit for semantically related predictions, revealing that ~17% of "errors" are actually plausible mispredictions.
- **Mechanism:** Custom extractors traverse each vocabulary's hierarchy from entity to root via parent relationships (is-a, part-of), capturing all paths including multiple inheritance cases. Evaluation then checks if predictions share ancestors/descendants with gold labels, computing Ancestor@k, Descendant@k, and Hierarchy@k metrics.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that proximity in ontological hierarchy correlates with semantic similarity relevant to downstream clinical tasks. This is intuitively sound but not empirically validated against clinical outcomes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "enriched with full ontological paths—i.e., from general to specific—in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies"
  - [section 6.1] "While TF-IDF attains Acc@1=51%, its Hierarchy@1 jumps to 68.6%, indicating that an additional ~17% of mentions retrieve a concept that is semantically related"
  - [corpus] Related work on hierarchical evaluation exists (Kosmopoulos et al., 2015; CoPHE metric), but corpus neighbors do not directly validate MedPath's specific hierarchical metrics.
- **Break condition:** Only 11 of 25 most frequent vocabularies had extractable hierarchies due to API/download limitations (Appendix D). Ontologies without public programmatic access cannot be evaluated hierarchically. Vocabularies with shallow or poorly structured hierarchies (e.g., OMIM has "no inherent taxonomy") provide limited path-based signal.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Training on the consolidated multi-domain dataset consistently outperforms single-dataset or single-domain training across semantic types.
- **Mechanism:** Unified UMLS mapping ensures consistent label semantics across domains. Pooling diverse supervision signals (clinical jargon, formal literature, informal social media, regulatory drug labels) exposes models to broader surface form variation for the same underlying concepts.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that domain diversity improves generalization without introducing harmful noise. This assumes annotation quality is comparable across all nine source datasets despite different annotation protocols.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "MedPath enables more robust, interoperable, and interpretable biomedical entity linking models"
  - [section 6.1, Figure 5 discussion] "We observe that the model trained on MedPath consistently outperforms the other two settings"
  - [corpus] Weak/missing—no corpus neighbors directly validate multi-domain consolidation benefits; related papers (BIBERT-Pipe, SynCABEL) address different dimensions (nested entities, synthetic data).
- **Break condition:** If source domains have fundamentally incompatible annotation guidelines (e.g., different span boundaries for nested entities), consolidation may introduce label noise. The paper acknowledges inherited annotation errors (Section "Limitations") but does not quantify their impact on consolidation benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: UMLS Architecture (CUI, TUI, Atom-Level Mappings)**
  - Why needed here: MedPath's entire value proposition depends on UMLS as the canonical backbone. Understanding how CUIs (Concept Unique Identifiers) unify codes from different vocabularies, how TUIs (Semantic Type Identifiers) categorize concepts, and how atom-level information enables cross-vocabulary mapping is essential.
  - Quick check question: Given that SNOMED-CT code "271782001" and MedDRA code "10013649" both represent "Drowsiness," how does UMLS represent this equivalence, and what information would you need to retrieve all hierarchical paths for this concept?

- **Concept: Ontological Hierarchy Structures (DAGs, Multiple Inheritance, Root-to-Leaf Paths)**
  - Why needed here: Path extraction must handle directed acyclic graphs where concepts can have multiple parents (84% of SNOMED-CT concepts have multiple inheritance per Section 4.3). Understanding how to traverse and store all possible paths is critical.
  - Quick check question: A concept has two parents: Parent A (depth 3 from root) and Parent B (depth 5 from root). If you only store one path, what information is lost? How would you represent this in a JSON schema?

- **Concept: Entity Linking Pipeline Stages (Candidate Generation → Reranking)**
  - Why needed here: MedPath's experiments use a two-stage EL architecture (Section 5.1). Understanding the tradeoffs between lexical retrieval (TF-IDF) and embedding-based retrieval (SapBERT), and how rerankers combine their outputs, is necessary to interpret results.
  - Quick check question: TF-IDF achieves higher Acc@1 (51.5%) than SapBERT (48.1%), but SapBERT achieves higher Acc@32 (73.7% vs 72.0%). What does this tell you about the retrieval characteristics of each method, and how would you design a hybrid approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. Data ingestion layer: Dataset-specific parsers for BRAT, PubTator, XML, TSV → standardized JSON
  2. Canonicalization module: UMLS dictionary lookup → CUI assignment with fallback heuristics
  3. Semantic enrichment layer: TUI extraction, cross-vocabulary code mapping via UMLS atoms
  4. Hierarchical path extraction: 11 vocabulary-specific extractors (SNOMED-CT, MeSH, ICD-10, etc.) with API/download interfaces
  5. Unified schema: Per-document JSON (mentions, offsets, CUIs) + separate mapping files (CUI→TUI, CUI→vocab codes, CUI→paths)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Obtain source datasets (some require DUAs—MIMIC-IV, ShARe/CLEF cannot be redistributed)
  2. Install UMLS Metathesaurus (requires license) and target ontologies
  3. Run unified parser → standardized JSON
  4. Execute canonicalization pipeline → mapped CUIs
  5. Run path extraction for 11 vocabularies → hierarchical annotations
  6. Validate: check unmapped entity rate, path completeness, vocabulary coverage

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fallback heuristics (exact match, substring containment) preserve ~2.5% additional coverage but introduce potentially noisy mappings—clearly flagged in data for user filtering
  - Version pinning (UMLS 2025AA, SNOMED-CT May 2025) ensures reproducibility but creates future drift; code is parameterized for version updates
  - Separate file structure (documents, mappings, paths) optimizes loading efficiency but requires join operations

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High unmapped entity rate (>5%): Check UMLS version compatibility with source dataset annotation periods
  - Missing paths for concepts that should have them: Verify vocabulary API access, check for obsolete/inactive codes
  - Cross-vocabulary mapping gaps: UMLS atom coverage is incomplete for some vocabulary pairs
  - Model training degradation on consolidated data: May indicate annotation noise overwhelming consolidation benefits; try filtering examples mapped via fallback heuristics

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline retrieval characterization**: Build unified UMLS dictionary, run TF-IDF and SapBERT candidate generation on full test set. Measure Acc@1, Acc@5, Acc@32, MRR@32 plus hierarchical metrics. Confirm paper's finding: TF-IDF stronger at Acc@1, SapBERT stronger at higher k; both show ~13-17% gains from flat to hierarchical metrics.
  2. **Training regime ablation**: Train SapBERT-based reranker under three conditions: (a) single dataset, (b) single domain (all datasets within domain), (c) full MedPath. Measure macro-averaged Acc@16 per semantic type. Expect full MedPath to consistently outperform, validating consolidation benefit.
  3. **Error taxonomy analysis**: For predictions where Acc@1 fails but Hierarchy@1 succeeds, classify as ancestor (over-general), descendant (over-specific), or sibling/cousin errors. Expect ~20% each for ancestor/descendant (granularity ambiguity) per Section 6.1. This informs whether to adjust training granularity or post-processing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Dependency on UMLS as canonical backbone limits coverage for vocabularies with poor UMLS mapping
- Hierarchical extraction only possible for 11 of 25 most frequent vocabularies due to API/download limitations
- Inherited annotation quality from source datasets with different protocols, no systematic cross-domain validation
- Approximately 2.5% of mentions lost during canonicalization, potentially introducing semantic noise

## Confidence

- **High**: Consolidated dataset improves cross-domain generalization (Section 6.1 experimental validation, consistent improvement across semantic types)
- **Medium**: Hierarchical metrics meaningfully capture semantic relatedness (~17% improvement from Acc@1 to Hierarchy@1, but clinical relevance not empirically validated)
- **Medium**: Fallback heuristics preserve coverage without significant quality degradation (acknowledged as "possibly noisy" but not quantified)

## Next Checks

1. Characterize the 2.5% unmapped entity distribution—do they cluster in specific vocabularies, semantic types, or source domains?
2. Validate hierarchical metric clinical relevance by having domain experts judge whether ancestor/descendant predictions are clinically acceptable
3. Test consolidation benefits on a held-out source dataset—train on all other datasets and measure transfer performance
