# How News Feels: Understanding Affective Bias in Multilingual Headlines for Human-Centered Media Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17252
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17252
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Negative emotions dominate Bengali news headlines, with anger, sadness, disappointment, and fear accounting for over half of all headlines

## Executive Summary
This study investigates affective bias in Bengali news headlines through analysis of 300,000 headlines using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B to detect fine-grained emotions. The research reveals that negative emotional framing—particularly anger, sadness, disappointment, and fear—significantly dominates news presentation, while neutral and positive tones are notably less common. The analysis demonstrates substantial variation in emotional portrayal across different news outlets, highlighting the prevalence of negativity bias in digital Bengali media.

The study proposes a human-centered news aggregator interface that visualizes emotional cues in headlines, enabling readers to become more aware of affective framing patterns. This approach aims to support more mindful media consumption by making emotional bias explicit and accessible to readers, potentially improving media literacy and reducing the unconscious impact of emotionally charged news framing.

## Method Summary
The research employs zero-shot inference using Gemma-3 4B to analyze 300,000 Bengali news headlines for emotion detection. The model performs fine-grained emotion classification without requiring labeled training data, identifying specific emotions such as anger, sadness, disappointment, and fear in news headlines. The study examines emotional patterns across multiple news outlets to understand how different publications frame stories through affective language. The methodology focuses on quantitative analysis of emotional distribution and variation across sources, though it relies on a single model approach without human validation.

## Key Results
- Negative emotions dominate news framing, accounting for over 50% of all analyzed headlines
- Anger, sadness, disappointment, and fear are the most prevalent negative emotions detected
- Significant variation exists in emotional portrayal patterns across different news outlets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging large language models' ability to perform zero-shot emotion classification, allowing systematic analysis of emotional patterns at scale. Gemma-3 4B's multilingual capabilities enable processing of Bengali text without requiring language-specific training data. The fine-grained emotion detection captures nuanced emotional content beyond simple positive/negative classification, revealing specific emotional patterns that contribute to affective bias in news media.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-shot inference**: Allows emotion detection without labeled training data, enabling rapid analysis of large text corpora; quick check: validate with human annotations
- **Multilingual NLP models**: Gemma-3 4B can process Bengali text, bridging language barriers in emotion analysis; quick check: compare with other multilingual models
- **Affective bias in media**: Understanding how emotional framing influences reader perception and media consumption patterns; quick check: measure correlation with engagement metrics
- **Emotion detection granularity**: Fine-grained classification (anger, sadness, disappointment, fear) provides more nuanced insights than binary positive/negative analysis; quick check: verify classification accuracy
- **Human-centered interface design**: Visualizing emotional cues helps readers recognize bias patterns; quick check: conduct user studies on interface effectiveness
- **Cross-outlet variation analysis**: Identifying differences in emotional framing strategies between news organizations; quick check: perform statistical significance testing

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: News headline collection -> Gemma-3 4B emotion detection -> Statistical analysis -> Interface visualization
- **Critical path**: Headline ingestion → Zero-shot emotion classification → Emotion distribution calculation → Variation analysis across outlets → Interface design proposal
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single model approach offers scalability but lacks validation; zero-shot method enables rapid analysis but may miss cultural nuances
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on one model may introduce systematic bias; absence of human validation limits accuracy verification; potential sampling bias in headline selection
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Human annotation study to validate Gemma-3 4B accuracy, 2) Cross-model comparison using XLM-R and mT5, 3) Statistical analysis of variation significance across outlets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on single model (Gemma-3 4B) without validation against human annotations
- No comparison with other multilingual emotion detection models
- Representativeness of 300,000 headlines across outlets and time periods not addressed
- Theoretical interface design without empirical evaluation of effectiveness

## Confidence
- Negative emotion dominance: Medium
- Specific emotion percentages: Low
- Variation across outlets: Medium
- Interface effectiveness: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human annotation study with Bengali speakers to validate Gemma-3 4B emotion classification accuracy against ground truth labels
2. Compare results using multiple multilingual models (e.g., XLM-R, mT5) to assess model-specific biases in emotion detection
3. Perform statistical analysis of emotional framing variation across outlets with confidence intervals and significance testing to quantify the claimed variation magnitude
