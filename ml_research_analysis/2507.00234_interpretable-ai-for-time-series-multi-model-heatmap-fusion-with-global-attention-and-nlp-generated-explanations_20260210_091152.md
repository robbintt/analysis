# Interpretable AI for Time-Series: Multi-Model Heatmap Fusion with Global Attention and NLP-Generated Explanations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.00234
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00234
- **Reference count:** 29
- **Key outcome:** Fused heatmaps from ResNet and 2D Transformer improve interpretability and accuracy on ECG and energy datasets.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a novel approach to time-series interpretability by fusing heatmaps from two complementary architectures—ResNet for local precision and a 2D Transformer for global context—into a unified visualization. The fusion leverages element-wise multiplication to maximize mutual information while preserving spatial-temporal alignment, and an NLP module translates the fused heatmaps into domain-specific narratives. Experiments on ECG arrhythmia classification and energy consumption regression demonstrate significant performance gains over baselines, with high-quality explanations validated by domain experts and linguistic metrics. The method provides a scalable, technically rigorous solution for transparent, time-aware decision-making in safety-critical domains.

## Method Summary
The approach combines a ResNet-18 backbone with 1D convolutions and a restructured 2D Transformer, both trained on multivariate time-series data. Grad-CAM heatmaps from ResNet capture local activations, while attention rollout from the Transformer captures global context. These are aligned via bilinear upsampling and Dynamic Time Warping, then fused using element-wise multiplication. An NLP module (T5 or template-based) translates the fused heatmaps into domain-specific explanations. The system is trained end-to-end with standard optimizers and evaluated on classification and regression tasks, with interpretability assessed via deletion tests and linguistic metrics.

## Key Results
- 94.1% accuracy (F1: 0.93) on PhysioNet ECG arrhythmia classification, outperforming baselines by 3.8–12.4%.
- RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R² = 0.95) on UCI Energy Appliance regression.
- BLEU-4 score of 0.586 and ROUGE-L score of 0.650 for NLP-generated explanations.
- Domain expert evaluations rate clarity and actionability at 4.6/5.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Consensus-Based Heatmap Fusion
The framework fuses ResNet gradients (local) and Transformer attention (global) via element-wise multiplication, acting as a consensus filter. This suppresses activations where only one model is confident and amplifies regions where both agree, reducing variance in the importance distribution. The core assumption is that true causal features appear in both gradient and attention spaces, while noise is uncorrelated.

### Mechanism 2: 2D Structured Self-Attention
By reshaping multivariate time-series as a 2D grid (Time × Channel), the Transformer learns cross-channel correlations that 1D models might miss. The Multi-Head Self-Attention computes pairwise similarities across both time and channels, assuming dependencies exist not just sequentially but spatially across channels.

### Mechanism 3: Semantic Grounding via Template/NLP Translation
Translating heatmaps into natural language bridges the gap between technical outputs and stakeholder actionability. Thresholding isolates salient regions, which are mapped to domain-specific labels and fed into a text generator. The assumption is that heatmap intensity correlates with relevant concepts, and the NLP model can map regions to domain vocabulary.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Grad-CAM vs. Attention Rollout**
  - **Why needed here:** The core contribution is fusing these two interpretability methods. Grad-CAM relies on gradients into the final conv layer (local), while Attention Rollout aggregates attention weights across layers (global).
  - **Quick check question:** If a model has no convolutional layers, can you use Grad-CAM? (Answer: No, it requires convolutional feature maps.)

- **Concept: Spatial-Temporal Alignment**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper identifies misalignment as a key problem. CNNs often downsample (losing specific time indices), while Transformers preserve resolution. Aligning them requires interpolation or DTW.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might simple addition of a downsampled CNN heatmap and a full-resolution Transformer heatmap fail? (Answer: The low resolution of the CNN map may blur the precise localization of the Transformer map.)

- **Concept: NLP Evaluation (BLEU/ROUGE)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims high linguistic fidelity. BLEU measures n-gram precision, while ROUGE measures recall.
  - **Quick check question:** If the generated explanation says "Cardiac issue found" but the ground truth is "Myocardial infarction detected," why might BLEU be low despite the meaning being similar? (Answer: BLEU penalizes lack of exact n-gram overlap.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → ResNet-18 → Grad-CAM Heatmap; Input → 2D Transformer → Attention Rollout Heatmap; Fuse (upsample + DTW + multiplication) → Classifier/Regressor + NLP Generator (T5/Templates)
- **Critical path:** The Fusion Layer. If upsampling or alignment is miscalibrated, the consensus multiplication will result in near-zero activations or amplified noise.
- **Design tradeoffs:** 30% inference latency overhead due to dual-model inference; acceptable for offline analysis but problematic for real-time ICU monitoring. Precision vs. context: fusing requires downsampling the Transformer or upsampling the ResNet, both risking information loss.
- **Failure signatures:** Noisy inputs cause misleading activations; hallucinated explanations if NLP lacks uncertainty quantification.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation on Fusion: Compare "Faithfulness" scores (deletion tests) using only ResNet, only Transformer, or Fused heatmaps.
  2. Alignment Stress Test: Feed time-series with known temporal shifts and verify if DTW alignment corrects the heatmap overlay before fusion.
  3. NLP Grounding Check: Generate explanations for synthetic data with injected "known" patterns and verify if the text description accurately reflects the pattern's location and shape.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can knowledge distillation reduce dual-model inference latency to enable real-time edge deployment?
- To what extent does spatiotemporal interpretability quantitatively improve domain expert decision-making efficiency compared to standard methods?
- How does the heatmap fusion mechanism degrade or adapt under non-stationary conditions such as concept drift?

## Limitations
- 30% additional inference latency due to dual-model inference.
- Potential for hallucinated explanations if NLP module is not strictly grounded in heatmap logic.
- Performance may degrade under concept drift or non-stationary data distributions.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core fusion mechanism (element-wise multiplication consensus); dual-architecture design; NLP explanation generation framework.
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific implementation details of fusion layer; exact T5 fine-tuning procedure; optimal hyperparameters.
- **Low Confidence:** Precise impact of each hyperparameter on final performance; generalizability of template-based NLP approach to unseen domains.

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the fusion weight α (0.1 to 0.9) and re-evaluate faithfulness scores to determine the optimal static weight, or implement and test a learned fusion approach.
2. Reconstruct the NLP module training process by creating a synthetic dataset of (heatmap, explanation) pairs based on known patterns, and fine-tune T5-small with varying beam sizes and maximum lengths to maximize BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L.
3. Apply the trained model to a new time-series dataset (e.g., stock market data) without retraining the NLP module to test the template's adaptability and identify potential domain-specific failure modes.
