core_contribution: The paper proposes SD-RAG, a framework to prevent privacy leaks
  in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Unlike existing methods that rely
  on instructing the LLM to avoid disclosing sensitive information, SD-RAG enforces
  security and privacy constraints during the retrieval phase before content reaches
  the generation model.

# SD-RAG: A Prompt-Injection-Resilient Framework for Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11199
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11199
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Achieves up to 58% improvement in privacy score compared to baselines

## Executive Summary
SD-RAG addresses privacy vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by enforcing security constraints during the retrieval phase rather than relying on LLM instructions. The framework uses a graph-based data model with human-readable constraints and an LLM-based redaction module to sanitize retrieved content before it reaches the generation model. Unlike traditional approaches that trust LLMs to avoid disclosing sensitive information, SD-RAG proactively prevents privacy leaks by controlling what information is retrieved and processed. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in privacy protection while maintaining resilience to prompt injection attacks.

## Method Summary
SD-RAG implements a two-phase approach where privacy constraints are enforced during content retrieval rather than relying on post-retrieval LLM instructions. The framework utilizes a graph-based data model that represents relationships between entities and incorporates human-readable privacy constraints. When a query is processed, the retrieval mechanism first applies these constraints to filter and sanitize content before passing it to the generation model. An LLM-based redaction module further processes retrieved content to ensure sensitive information is properly handled. This approach fundamentally shifts privacy protection from the generation phase to the retrieval phase, creating a more robust defense against both unintentional disclosures and adversarial prompt injection attacks.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 58% improvement in privacy score compared to baseline RAG systems
- Demonstrates resilience to prompt injection attacks through proactive constraint enforcement
- Maintains system performance while significantly enhancing privacy protection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SD-RAG works by shifting privacy enforcement from the generation phase to the retrieval phase, where it's more effective and reliable. By applying privacy constraints before sensitive content reaches the LLM, the framework prevents the generation model from having access to information it shouldn't disclose. The graph-based data model allows for precise definition of privacy relationships and constraints, while the redaction module provides an additional layer of protection. This multi-layered approach creates defense in depth, making it significantly harder for attackers to bypass privacy protections through prompt manipulation.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph-based data modeling for privacy constraints: Needed to represent complex relationships between sensitive entities and define precise access rules; Quick check: Verify constraint graph correctly captures all required privacy relationships
- LLM-based content redaction: Required to automatically sanitize retrieved content while preserving useful information; Quick check: Test redaction module on diverse sensitive content samples
- Prompt injection attack vectors: Essential to understand how adversaries might bypass privacy protections; Quick check: Validate system resilience against common injection patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User Query -> Graph-based Constraint Engine -> Retrieval Module -> LLM-based Redaction -> Generation Model -> Response

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from query processing through constraint enforcement to content generation. Privacy constraints are applied first, followed by retrieval with filtering, then redaction of retrieved content, and finally generation using only sanitized content.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational overhead vs. privacy protection: Additional redaction step increases latency but provides stronger guarantees
- Granularity of constraints vs. system complexity: More detailed constraints improve precision but require more maintenance
- LLM dependency vs. reliability: Using LLM for redaction leverages advanced capabilities but introduces potential variability

Failure Signatures:
- Over-redaction leading to loss of useful information
- Incomplete constraint coverage allowing privacy breaches
- LLM redaction failures producing inconsistent results
- Performance degradation due to additional processing steps

First Experiments:
1. Test constraint engine with edge cases to verify coverage completeness
2. Benchmark redaction module performance across different content types
3. Measure end-to-end latency impact of the additional privacy layers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology lacks transparency regarding privacy scoring metrics
- Performance on diverse real-world datasets not demonstrated
- Computational overhead of redaction module not quantified

## Confidence
- Privacy Improvement Claims: Medium - 58% improvement based on undisclosed metrics
- Resilience to Prompt Injection: Medium - Claims not fully validated against comprehensive attack vectors
- Framework Applicability: Low - Limited evidence of effectiveness on diverse, real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive evaluations on diverse, real-world datasets with varying levels of sensitivity and complexity to validate the framework's effectiveness and generalizability.
2. Perform a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the redaction module and assess its impact on system performance in practical scenarios.
3. Design and execute comprehensive prompt injection attack tests to rigorously evaluate the framework's resilience against a wide range of attack vectors.
