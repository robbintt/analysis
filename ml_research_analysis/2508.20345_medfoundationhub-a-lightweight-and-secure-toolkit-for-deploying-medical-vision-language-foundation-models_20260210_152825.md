# MedFoundationHub: A Lightweight and Secure Toolkit for Deploying Medical Vision Language Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.20345
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20345
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Secure on-premise VLM deployment with GUI enables privacy-preserving pathology inference; expert evaluation reveals domain training gaps

## Executive Summary
MedFoundationHub addresses critical privacy and deployment challenges for medical vision-language models by providing a lightweight, Docker-orchestrated GUI toolkit that enables secure, on-premise inference without programming expertise. The system integrates Hugging Face models through a plug-and-play architecture and runs efficiently on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU, making it accessible to typical academic research labs. Board-certified pathologists evaluated five VLMs (Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B) across 1,015 clinician-model scoring events using colon and renal pathology cases. Results revealed that while some models achieved correct diagnoses with sound reasoning (scores 3–4), most outputs were off-target, vague, or inconsistent with pathology terminology, underscoring the need for domain-customized training and safer deployment strategies.

## Method Summary
The system employs Docker containerization to isolate model execution within institutional infrastructure, ensuring privacy preservation through operating system-agnostic deployment. A dual registry manages both Hugging Face and locally stored models, enabling reproducible version control and seamless switching between different VLMs. The frontend-backend decoupled architecture provides clinicians with a case-centric dashboard for model selection, image loading, prompt input, and report generation, while backend containers handle standardized inference through unified APIs. The evaluation framework uses board-certified pathologists to score VLM outputs on colon and renal pathology cases using a 0-4 rubric assessing correctness and reasoning quality.

## Key Results
- VLMs achieved correct diagnoses with sound reasoning on some cases (scores 3–4), but most outputs were off-target, vague, or inconsistent with pathology terminology
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct failed catastrophically on renal pathology (101/105 cases scored 0–2)
- System runs efficiently on single NVIDIA A6000 GPU with 48GB memory, though LLaVA-1.5-13B approached memory limits
- Truncated outputs and lettered-choice responses without explanation were observed, indicating generation configuration mismatches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Docker-orchestrated container isolation enables privacy-preserving on-premise inference for medical VLMs.
- Mechanism: The system confines all model installation, execution, and storage to institutional infrastructure by running each model Mθ inside an isolated Docker container. Clinical inputs (image I, prompt q) never leave the local workstation, minimizing attack surface and enforcing data sovereignty.
- Core assumption: Institutions have workstations with NVIDIA GPU support and can run Docker without cloud dependencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ensures privacy-preserving inference through Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment"
  - [section 3] "By confining installation, execution, and storage to the institutional infrastructure, MedFoundationHub enforces strict data sovereignty and minimizes attack surface"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus focuses on VLM evaluation benchmarks rather than deployment architectures
- Break condition: If institutional IT policies block Docker or require cloud-based inference, the privacy guarantee is nullified.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dual registry design (Hugging Face + local) supports reproducible model versioning and seamless switching between VLMs.
- Mechanism: A registry R = {(Mθi, vi, metai)} maintains model weights, version tags, and provenance metadata. Models are automatically containerized upon registration, enabling comparative evaluation with full audit trails.
- Core assumption: Models from Hugging Face have compatible APIs and can be wrapped without custom adaptation logic.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Retrieval occurs through a controlled external channel that downloads model weights θ only, after which all inference remains confined to the internal environment"
  - [section 3] "Registered models are automatically containerized, ensuring reproducible deployment and version control"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers replicate this registry-based deployment pattern; most focus on model performance rather than deployment infrastructure
- Break condition: If model architectures diverge significantly from expected APIs (e.g., non-standard tokenizers), automatic containerization may fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Frontend-backend decoupling with standardized inference APIs enables non-programmers to evaluate multiple VLMs through a GUI.
- Mechanism: Clinicians interact via a case-centric dashboard that routes (I, q) pairs to backend containers. Each container implements z = CrossAttn(fimg(I), ftext(q)), producing outputs through a unified service interface.
- Core assumption: Clinicians can formulate effective natural-language prompts without training on prompt engineering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "enables physicians to manually select and use different models without programming expertise"
  - [section 3] "This interactive loop transforms raw VLM outputs into clinically interpretable insights while simultaneously generating high-value ground truth for benchmarking"
  - [corpus] VLM-Lens toolkit (arXiv:2510.02292) similarly abstracts VLM complexity via YAML configuration, suggesting this decoupling pattern is emerging but not standardized
- Break condition: If cross-attention fusion fails for specific image resolutions or prompt structures, output quality degrades without user-visible error signals.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Docker containerization
  - Why needed here: All inference runs in isolated containers; understanding container lifecycle is essential for debugging deployment failures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a container restart does not persist data without mounted volumes?

- Concept: Vision-Language Model (VLM) architecture
  - Why needed here: The system integrates multiple VLMs with different encoder-decoder configurations; understanding fimg and ftext encoders helps diagnose fusion failures.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of cross-attention in combining image and text embeddings?

- Concept: Medical imaging data constraints
  - Why needed here: Whole-slide pathology images have high resolution (H×W×C) and may require preprocessing; understanding GPU memory limits prevents OOM errors.
  - Quick check question: Why does a 48GB A6000 GPU impose constraints on maximum image resolution for inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frontend (Web dashboard) -> Backend (Docker inference plane) -> Registry (Hugging Face + local models)

- Critical path: Model registration → Container build → Case upload → Prompt submission → Inference execution → Report generation → Clinician scoring

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-GPU constraint limits concurrent model instances; sequential inference required for multi-model comparison
  - GUI abstraction reduces flexibility; clinicians cannot modify inference hyperparameters
  - Offline deployment enhances security but requires manual model weight management

- Failure signatures:
  - Truncated outputs (observed with LLaVA-1.5-7B): Likely token limit or generation config mismatch
  - Lettered-choice responses without explanation (observed with Qwen2.5-7B): Prompt template not aligned with model training
  - Off-target morphological reasoning: Model lacks domain-specific fine-tuning for pathology lexicon

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Register and deploy MedGemma3-4B via Hugging Face ID; verify container build succeeds and inference returns structured output
  2. Upload a single colon pathology case; run inference across all three evaluated models; compare latency and GPU utilization metrics
  3. Submit prompts with varying specificity (e.g., "Describe this image" vs. "Identify diagnostic features of hyperplastic polyp"); score outputs using the 0-4 rubric to assess prompt sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What domain-customized training approaches would effectively improve VLM performance on specialized pathology tasks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state deployment "demands domain-customized training." Renal pathology showed catastrophic failure (101/105 cases wrong for Qwen2.5-7B).
  - Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need but does not test any domain-customized training approaches.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of VLMs trained with different pathology-specific datasets on the same benchmarks.

- Do clinician assessment scores predict real-world diagnostic accuracy when VLMs are used in clinical workflows?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Future directions include "conducting longitudinal user studies with practicing pathologists."
  - Why unresolved: Current evaluation captures expert opinion in isolation, not impact on actual diagnostic decisions or patient outcomes.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Prospective study comparing diagnostic accuracy with and without VLM assistance in live clinical settings.

- What causes VLMs to mishandle pathology-specific terminology in reasoning chains?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] Models produce "vague reasoning" and "inconsistent pathology terminology," with Case A showing incorrect morphologic anchors confusing hyperplastic polyps with sessile serrated lesions.
  - Why unresolved: The terminology gap is demonstrated but its root cause (training data composition, tokenization, or architecture) remains uninvestigated.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies correlating pathology lexicon frequency in pretraining with terminology accuracy scores.

## Limitations

- Dataset accessibility: The colon pathology cases from PathologyOutlines and renal pathology sources (Arkana Labs, AJKD Atlas, NephSIM) are not directly provided, requiring independent curation that may affect reproducibility of the 1,015 scoring events.
- Inference configuration opacity: Key hyperparameters including temperature, max tokens, and top-p values are unspecified, making it unclear whether observed model failures (truncated outputs, lettered responses) stem from architecture limitations or suboptimal generation settings.
- Docker deployment complexity: While the system claims plug-and-play functionality, the actual Docker configuration details, GPU allocation strategies, and dependency management remain underspecified, potentially limiting deployment in heterogeneous institutional environments.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The Docker container isolation mechanism for privacy preservation is well-supported by the architectural description and aligns with standard container security practices.
- Medium confidence: The frontend-backend decoupling enabling non-programmer access is plausible given the GUI dashboard description, though the exact extent of abstraction and error handling is unclear.
- Low confidence: The automatic containerization of Hugging Face models assumes API compatibility without demonstrating adaptation logic for divergent architectures.

## Next Checks

1. Container lifecycle validation: Test whether model registration and container builds succeed across the full range of Hugging Face VLM variants, particularly for models with non-standard tokenizers or encoder configurations.
2. Prompt template standardization: Replicate the evaluation using a controlled prompt template across all models to isolate whether observed output quality differences stem from model architecture versus prompt sensitivity.
3. Resource utilization profiling: Monitor GPU memory usage and inference latency across different model sizes (4B vs 13B parameters) to verify the claimed efficiency on single A6000 GPU and identify potential bottlenecks in concurrent deployment scenarios.
