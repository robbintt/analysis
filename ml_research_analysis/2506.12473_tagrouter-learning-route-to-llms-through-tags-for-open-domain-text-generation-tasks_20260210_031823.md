# TagRouter: Learning Route to LLMs through Tags for Open-Domain Text Generation Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12473
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12473
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Training-free model routing method using semantic tags achieves 6.15% higher accept rate and 17.20% cost reduction compared to 13 baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently routing user queries to the most suitable large language models (LLMs) within a model system to maximize collective performance while minimizing costs. The authors propose TAGROUTER, a training-free model routing method that leverages self-aware tags to capture semantic features of user queries and control the behavior of multiple models. The system consists of three modules: TAGGENERATOR, TAGSCORER, and TAGDECIDER, which work together to select the optimal model for inference based on computed scores and cost-awareness thresholds.

## Method Summary
TAGROUTER employs a training-free approach to model routing that leverages semantic tags for query representation. The TAGGENERATOR module creates fine-grained tags for each user query, capturing its semantic features. The TAGSCORER module evaluates the performance of different models on these tags, while the TAGDECIDER selects the optimal model for inference based on the computed scores and a cost-awareness threshold. This approach enables efficient and scalable model ensembling for open-domain text generation tasks without requiring additional training.

## Key Results
- TAGROUTER outperforms 13 baseline methods on the BCUQ dataset
- Achieves a 6.15% increase in accept rate compared to baselines
- Reduces costs by 17.20% while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TAGROUTER works by decomposing the routing problem into semantic understanding and performance prediction. The tag-based representation captures query characteristics that correlate with model strengths, enabling accurate performance prediction without requiring labeled routing data. The cost-awareness threshold allows dynamic trade-offs between quality and computational expense, optimizing resource allocation across the model ensemble.

## Foundational Learning
- Semantic tagging: why needed - to capture query characteristics that determine model suitability; quick check - validate tag coverage across diverse query types
- Performance prediction: why needed - to estimate model effectiveness without running inference; quick check - compare predicted vs actual performance on held-out queries
- Cost-aware decision making: why needed - to balance quality and resource constraints; quick check - verify cost reduction doesn't compromise accept rate

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: TAGGENERATOR -> TAGSCORER -> TAGDECIDER

Critical path: Query → TAGGENERATOR → TAGSCORER → TAGDECIDER → Selected Model → Output

Design tradeoffs: Training-free approach trades adaptation capability for deployment simplicity and scalability

Failure signatures: Poor tag generation leads to suboptimal routing; cost threshold misconfiguration results in either excessive costs or low quality

First experiments:
1. Evaluate tag generation quality on diverse query types
2. Measure TAGSCORER accuracy in predicting model performance
3. Test cost-quality trade-off at different threshold settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Lack of comparative analysis against more recent model routing approaches beyond 13 baselines
- Single dataset evaluation (BCUQ) raises questions about generalizability across domains
- No discussion of potential biases in tag generation or scoring that could lead to suboptimal model selection
- Cost reduction metric lacks specification of calculation methodology and real-world deployment validation

## Confidence

High confidence claims:
- TAGROUTER provides an efficient and scalable solution for model ensembling

Medium confidence claims:
- TAGROUTER achieves a 6.15% increase in accept rate (based on single dataset)
- TAGROUTER achieves a 17.20% cost reduction (methodology not fully specified)

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate TAGROUTER's performance on multiple diverse datasets beyond BCUQ to assess generalizability across different domains and query types.

2. Compare TAGROUTER against state-of-the-art model routing approaches published after 2023 to ensure competitive positioning.

3. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess how TAGROUTER's performance evolves as underlying LLM capabilities change over time.
