# Measuring and Aligning Abstraction in Vision-Language Models with Medical Taxonomies

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14827
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14827
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Vision-language models exhibit >10% catastrophic abstraction errors in chest X-ray classification, which can be reduced below 2% through risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical limitation in vision-language models (VLMs) used for medical imaging: their tendency to make clinically severe classification errors by confusing findings across unrelated taxonomic branches. Standard flat evaluation metrics fail to capture these "Catastrophic Abstraction Errors" (CAEs), which can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses. The authors introduce CAE as a hierarchical metric specifically designed for multi-label settings, benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs, and propose two lightweight mitigation strategies that significantly reduce CAEs while maintaining competitive flat performance.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework for multi-label medical image classification that captures both flat performance metrics (F1, precision, recall) and the newly proposed Catastrophic Abstraction Error (CAE) metric. They benchmark SOTA VLMs on chest X-ray classification using MedRadVQA taxonomy and demonstrate that top-performing models exhibit CAE rates exceeding 10%. To address this, they propose two mitigation strategies: risk-constrained thresholding that limits CAE rates below 2% while maintaining F1 scores, and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning using radial embeddings that align model representations with medical hierarchies. Both approaches successfully reduce CAEs to clinically acceptable levels without significant performance degradation on flat metrics.

## Key Results
- VLMs achieve high flat performance (F1 >0.8) but exhibit CAE rates above 10% when evaluated hierarchically
- Risk-constrained thresholding reduces CAE rates below 2% while maintaining competitive F1 scores
- Taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings further reduces CAEs and improves alignment with medical hierarchies
- The proposed CAE metric reveals clinically significant failures invisible to standard flat evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper addresses the fundamental mismatch between how VLMs learn representations and how medical taxonomies structure knowledge. Standard VLMs optimize for flat classification accuracy without considering hierarchical relationships between medical findings. This leads to confident but clinically incorrect predictions where models confuse findings from unrelated branches of the medical taxonomy. By introducing CAE as a metric that explicitly measures these hierarchical violations and by aligning model representations with taxonomy structure through radial embeddings, the authors create a framework where VLMs learn to respect medical knowledge organization while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

**Medical Taxonomies** - Hierarchical organization of medical concepts
*Why needed:* Medical knowledge is inherently hierarchical; flat classification ignores critical relationships between findings
*Quick check:* Verify taxonomy depth and branching structure for the specific medical domain

**Catastrophic Abstraction Errors (CAEs)** - Misclassifications across unrelated taxonomic branches
*Why needed:* Captures clinically severe errors invisible to standard metrics
*Quick check:* Calculate CAE rate alongside flat metrics to identify model vulnerabilities

**Radial Embeddings** - Vector representations aligned with hierarchical structure
*Why needed:* Enables models to learn taxonomy-aware representations
*Quick check:* Visualize embedding space to verify hierarchical clustering patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image → VLM Backbone → Classification Head → Thresholding Layer → CAE Metric
**Critical Path:** Image features → taxonomy-aligned embeddings → multi-label predictions → hierarchical evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Precision vs. recall in multi-label setting, flat performance vs. hierarchical safety, model complexity vs. clinical interpretability
**Failure Signatures:** High flat F1 with elevated CAE rates, confident predictions on taxonomically unrelated findings, misaligned embedding space
**First Experiments:** 1) Benchmark CAE rates across SOTA VLMs, 2) Implement risk-constrained thresholding to achieve <2% CAE, 3) Train taxonomy-aware model with radial embeddings and compare CAE reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Study limited to chest X-ray classification in multi-label setting
- 2% CAE threshold appears arbitrary without clinical validation
- Taxonomy-aware fine-tuning may overfit to specific MedRadVQA structure
- Does not address potential degradation in rare finding detection

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Observation that VLMs exhibit high flat performance while producing clinically severe CAEs (>10% rates)
- **Medium confidence:** Risk-constrained thresholding effectively maintains CAE rates below 2% while preserving F1 scores
- **Medium confidence:** Radial embedding approach reduces CAEs but improvement over baseline fine-tuning is modest

## Next Checks

1. Conduct temporal validation by evaluating model stability over extended deployment periods with evolving clinical cases to assess whether CAE rates remain below 2% in practice
2. Perform ablation studies specifically isolating the contribution of radial embeddings versus other fine-tuning modifications to better quantify their unique impact on CAE reduction
3. Test the methodology on alternative medical imaging taxonomies (e.g., pathology reports, other imaging modalities) to evaluate generalizability beyond chest X-ray classification
