core_contribution: The paper addresses word sense disambiguation for fine-grained
  semantic distinctions by integrating symbolic natural language understanding (NLU)
  systems with large language models (LLMs). The core method generates multiple candidate
  meanings from a symbolic NLU system, converts them to natural language descriptions,
  and uses an LLM to select the most appropriate interpretation given context.

# Integrating Symbolic Natural Language Understanding and Language Models for Word Sense Disambiguation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16577
- Authors: Kexin Zhao; Ken Forbus
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Achieves 84.2% accuracy for coarse-grained frame disambiguation and 82.5% for fine-grained predicate disambiguation on COPA premises

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an innovative approach to word sense disambiguation that bridges symbolic natural language understanding systems with large language models. The method leverages a symbolic NLU system to generate multiple candidate meanings, converts these into natural language descriptions, and employs an LLM to select the most contextually appropriate interpretation. This hybrid approach eliminates the need for hand-annotated training data while achieving superior performance on both coarse and fine-grained disambiguation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over BERT baselines, particularly for fine-grained distinctions where the LLM-enhanced approach shows dramatic gains.

## Method Summary
The core methodology involves generating multiple candidate meanings from a symbolic NLU system, converting these symbolic representations into natural language descriptions, and using an LLM to select the most appropriate interpretation based on contextual cues. This approach effectively combines the structured knowledge representation capabilities of symbolic systems with the contextual reasoning strengths of modern language models. The method operates without requiring hand-annotated training data, instead relying on the LLM's ability to evaluate contextual appropriateness among candidate interpretations generated by the symbolic system.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.2% accuracy on coarse-grained frame disambiguation compared to 69.3% for BERT baseline
- Achieves 82.5% accuracy on fine-grained predicate disambiguation compared to 20.2% for BERT baseline
- Demonstrates significant performance improvements across both coarse and fine-grained word sense disambiguation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach succeeds by leveraging complementary strengths of symbolic and neural systems. Symbolic NLU systems provide structured, rule-based meaning representations that capture fine-grained semantic distinctions, while LLMs excel at contextual reasoning and selection among alternatives. By generating multiple candidate interpretations through symbolic means and then using LLM-based contextual evaluation, the method overcomes the limitations of both approaches when used in isolation. The symbolic component ensures semantic precision while the LLM component handles contextual ambiguity effectively.

## Foundational Learning

**Symbolic NLU Systems**: Rule-based systems that represent meaning through structured frameworks like semantic frames and predicate logic. Needed for precise semantic representation; check by verifying the system can generate multiple candidate meanings for ambiguous words.

**LLM Contextual Reasoning**: Large language models' ability to evaluate contextual appropriateness. Needed for selecting the most fitting interpretation among candidates; check by testing LLM's consistency in similar disambiguation tasks.

**Semantic Frames**: Structured representations of word meanings that capture semantic roles and relationships. Needed for organizing fine-grained distinctions; check by examining frame coverage and granularity.

**Coarse vs Fine-grained Disambiguation**: Different levels of semantic distinction granularity. Needed to understand performance variations across task types; check by comparing results across both levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Symbolic NLU System -> Candidate Generation -> Natural Language Conversion -> LLM Evaluation -> Final Selection

**Critical Path**: Input text → Symbolic NLU parsing → Multiple candidate generation → NL description conversion → LLM ranking → Output selection

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational efficiency (generating multiple candidates and LLM evaluation) for accuracy gains and training data independence. Alternative designs could include confidence thresholds or hybrid scoring mechanisms.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance likely indicates either insufficient symbolic NLU coverage (missing candidate meanings) or LLM evaluation failure (inability to distinguish contextually appropriate meanings). Systematic errors may reveal domain-specific limitations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test symbolic NLU system coverage on a diverse vocabulary set to identify potential blind spots
2. Evaluate LLM's disambiguation accuracy with synthetic contexts to isolate its performance
3. Compare human performance on the same disambiguation tasks to establish upper bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance may not generalize to broader domains beyond COPA premises
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and coverage of the underlying symbolic NLU system
- Results may vary substantially across different languages and domain-specific vocabularies

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence**:
- Integration effectiveness: High confidence - Methodology clearly described and reproducible
- Domain generalizability: Medium confidence - Limited to tested dataset with no cross-domain validation
- Training data independence: High confidence - Methodologically sound and well-documented

## Next Checks
1. Cross-domain validation: Test the integrated approach on diverse text domains (news, academic, social media) to assess robustness beyond COPA premises
2. Linguistic diversity assessment: Evaluate performance across multiple languages, particularly low-resource languages where symbolic NLU systems may have limited coverage
3. Error analysis on failure cases: Conduct systematic analysis of disambiguation failures to identify whether errors stem from the symbolic NLU component, LLM interpretation, or integration mechanism itself
