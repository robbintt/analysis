core_contribution: 'This paper introduces the first unified evaluation framework for
  Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) in multi-annotator learning, addressing the lack
  of principled methods to assess tendency capture and explainability quality. The
  framework includes two novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency
  (DIC), which quantifies tendency capture by comparing predicted and ground-truth
  inter-annotator consistency structures using Cohen''s kappa, and (2) Behavior Alignment
  Explainability (BAE), which evaluates explainability quality by aligning explainability-derived
  with ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).'

# A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10393
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces DIC and BAE metrics to evaluate ITL methods, showing QuMAB achieves lowest DIC (0.23-0.54) and highest BAE (0.52-0.57) across domains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) methods for multi-annotator learning by introducing a unified framework with two novel metrics: DIC for tendency capture and BAE for explainability quality. The framework moves beyond traditional accuracy metrics to assess whether models truly capture annotator-specific behavioral patterns and provide meaningful explanations. Extensive experiments on video emotion recognition and urban image assessment datasets demonstrate that DIC and BAE effectively differentiate model performance, with QuMAB consistently outperforming other ITL architectures across both domains.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates ITL methods using two complementary metrics. DIC quantifies tendency capture by computing Cohen's kappa on overlapping annotations to create ground-truth and predicted inter-annotator consistency matrices, then measuring their structural alignment via normalized Frobenius norm. BAE evaluates explainability by extracting annotator-specific representations or attention patterns, computing cosine similarity matrices, projecting via MDS, and measuring alignment with ground-truth behavioral similarity structures. The approach is validated on AMER (13 annotators, video emotion) and STREET (10 annotators, urban image impression) datasets using four representative ITL methods.

## Key Results
- DIC ranges reveal substantial method discrimination: QuMAB (0.23-0.54), others (0.29-0.57), random baseline (0.86-0.93)
- Traditional metrics show limited variation (0.06-0.09 range) while DIC reveals pronounced differences
- BAE confirms QuMAB's superior performance (0.52-0.57) across feature-level and region-level explainability
- Feature-level BAE generally outperforms region-level, suggesting representation-based explanations may be more robust than attention-based ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Inter-annotator consistency structure preservation indicates genuine tendency capture better than per-annotator accuracy alone
- Mechan: Compute ground-truth consistency matrix M using Cohen's kappa on overlapping annotations; compute predicted consistency matrix M' from model outputs; measure structural alignment via normalized Frobenius norm (DIC = ||M - M'||_F / ||M||_F)
- Core assumption: If an ITL method truly preserves individual tendencies, the patterns of agreement and disagreement between annotators in predictions should mirror those in actual annotations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DIC quantifies tendency capture by comparing predicted and ground-truth inter-annotator consistency structures using Cohen's kappa"
  - [Section 3.1] "If a model truly preserves annotator tendencies, the patterns of agreement and disagreement between annotators in predictions should mirror those in ground-truth annotations"
  - [corpus] Weak direct corpus support; related work (e.g., "Beyond Consensus") discusses modeling disagreement but does not validate this specific structural-preservation hypothesis
- Break condition: If per-annotator accuracy is high but inter-annotator consistency patterns diverge substantially from ground truth, the model may be fitting instance-level noise rather than capturing genuine tendencies

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aligning explanation-derived similarities with ground-truth behavioral patterns via MDS quantifies explainability quality
- Mechan: Extract annotator-specific representations (feature-level) or attention patterns (region-level); compute cosine similarity matrices; project via MDS; measure alignment with ground-truth behavioral similarity (BAE = 1 - ||S_model - S_true||_F / ||S_true||_F)
- Core assumption: If model explanations reflect true annotator behavior, similarity relationships derived from representations or attention should structurally align with actual annotation patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "BAE evaluates explainability quality by aligning explainability-derived with ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)"
  - [Section 3.2] "If a model's explanations truly reflect annotator behavior patterns, the similarity relationships derived from individual annotators' representations...should structurally align with those computed from actual annotation behaviors"
  - [corpus] Limited corpus validation; no neighbor papers directly test MDS-based explainability alignment for multi-annotator settings
- Break condition: If attention patterns or representations yield high BAE but do not correspond to decision-relevant regions (per comprehensiveness validation), the alignment may be superficial

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Structural evaluation metrics (DIC/BAE) discriminate between ITL methods more sensitively than traditional metrics (accuracy, Fleiss' kappa, PCC)
- Mechan: Traditional metrics measure instance-level correctness or aggregate agreement; DIC/BAE measure preservation of relational structure among annotators, capturing tendency fidelity that instance metrics miss
- Core assumption: Models with similar per-annotator accuracy can induce very different inter-annotator similarity structures, which affects interpretation of group dynamics
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "traditional metrics like accuracy show limited variation (0.06-0.09 range)" while DIC varies substantially
  - [Section 4.1] "While traditional metrics show limited variation (ranges within 0.06-0.09), DIC reveals more pronounced differences"
  - [corpus] Assumption: related multi-annotator works (e.g., QuMAB, TAX) implicitly assume structural preservation matters, but this paper provides the first direct empirical test
- Break condition: If traditional metrics already show large variance across methods, the added discriminative value of DIC/BAE diminishes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cohen's kappa coefficient**
  - Why needed here: Core to computing inter-annotator consistency matrices for DIC; measures agreement beyond chance
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why raw agreement overestimates consistency compared to kappa?

- Concept: **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**
  - Why needed here: Projects high-dimensional similarity matrices into 2D for visual and quantitative alignment assessment in BAE
  - Quick check question: What does proximity in MDS space represent, and what are its limitations for preserving global structure?

- Concept: **Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL) vs Individual Tendency Learning (ITL)**
  - Why needed here: Frames the paradigm shift this paper addresses; CoL aggregates annotations, ITL models annotator-specific behaviors
  - Quick check question: In what scenarios would you prefer ITL over CoL, and what tradeoffs does this introduce?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Multi-annotator labels Y_k per annotator k; model predictions Ŷ_k
  - DIC pipeline: Overlapping sample sets S_kl → Cohen's kappa per pair → M (ground-truth) and M' (predicted) → Frobenius norm difference
  - BAE pipeline: Annotator representations F_avg or attention A_avg → cosine similarity S_model → MDS projection → alignment with S_true
  - Output: DIC (lower is better), BAE (higher is better)

- Critical path:
  1. Ensure minimum overlapping annotation threshold τ for reliable kappa computation
  2. Extract penultimate-layer representations per annotator (feature-level) or attention weights (region-level)
  3. Compute ground-truth behavioral similarity S_true from actual annotations
  4. Normalize matrices before Frobenius norm computation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature-level BAE applies to all architectures; region-level only to attention-based models
  - Region-level provides finer-grained behavioral insight but may not consistently outperform feature-level
  - DIC complements but does not replace instance-level accuracy metrics

- Failure signatures:
  - High DIC (>0.6) with moderate accuracy: structural modeling failure
  - Low BAE (<0.3) with high accuracy: representations do not capture behavioral distinctions
  - Random baseline DIC: 0.86-0.93; Consensus baseline DIC: 0.51-0.61

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate DIC computation on STREET dataset: compute M from annotations, M' from model predictions, verify DIC ranges match Table 1
  2. Visualize MDS projections for BAE: confirm clusters align with high-agreement annotator groups (κ > 0.6)
  3. Ablation test: run Random and Consensus baselines to verify DIC/BAE sensitivity across the performance spectrum

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can scalable alternatives to eye-tracking be developed for acquiring human-derived behavioral signals in ITL evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states: "A potential enhancement would be incorporating human-derived behavioral signals into the evaluation framework. While eye-tracking can capture annotators' attention patterns... such approaches remain high-cost and difficult to scale. In future work, we aim to explore scalable alternatives for acquiring such signals."
- Why unresolved: Current eye-tracking approaches are prohibitively expensive and impractical for large-scale annotation scenarios; no low-cost substitutes have been validated
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a scalable behavioral signal acquisition method (e.g., mouse tracking, implicit feedback) that correlates with eye-tracking ground truth and improves DIC/BAE evaluation fidelity

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should DIC and BAE metrics be adapted for ordinal and continuous annotation settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 3.1 states: "While we use Cohen's kappa for categorical annotations in this work, DIC only requires a well-defined inter-annotator similarity measure and can be readily extended to ordinal or continuous annotations by adopting appropriate agreement or correlation metrics."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the framework only on categorical labels (emotion recognition, impression assessment); the theoretical extension to ordinal/continuous labels remains unvalidated
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical validation on datasets with ordinal (e.g., Likert scales) or continuous (e.g., regression-based) annotations showing DIC/BAE effectively differentiate model performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between tendency preservation (DIC) and prediction accuracy, and are there inherent trade-offs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that "accurately reproducing individual annotations does not necessarily imply that the relational structure within the annotator pool is preserved" and that models with similar accuracy "may induce very different inter-annotator similarity structures." However, the experiments show QuMAB achieves both best accuracy and lowest DIC, leaving the trade-off question open
- Why unresolved: No controlled experiments isolate the trade-off; all tested methods show aligned accuracy-DIC trends
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with models explicitly optimized for accuracy vs. tendency preservation, revealing whether Pareto-optimal solutions exist or if the objectives are generally aligned

## Limitations

- Framework relies on sufficient overlapping annotations for reliable kappa computation, but minimum overlap threshold τ is not specified
- Theoretical justification for why structural preservation specifically indicates better tendency modeling is limited
- MDS-based BAE assumes behavioral similarity structures should align with representation-derived similarities without rigorous validation of this relationship

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: DIC's core computation and its ability to differentiate ITL methods from random and consensus baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: BAE's effectiveness, as the paper provides results but limited theoretical grounding for why MDS alignment reflects explainability quality
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that traditional metrics show limited variation (0.06-0.09) while DIC/BAE reveal more discrimination

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the minimum overlap threshold τ for Cohen's kappa computation and measure its impact on DIC stability and discriminative power
2. **Ground-Truth Behavioral Validation**: Conduct ablation studies where ground-truth annotator behaviors are perturbed to verify that DIC and BAE scores decrease proportionally to the degree of structural misalignment
3. **Explainability Alignment Verification**: Perform qualitative analysis of MDS projections to confirm that high-BAE clusters correspond to annotators with high ground-truth inter-annotator agreement (κ > 0.6)
