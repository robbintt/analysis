# maxVSTAR: Maximally Adaptive Vision-Guided CSI Sensing with Closed-Loop Edge Model Adaptation for Robust Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.26146
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26146
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Restored HAR accuracy from 49.14% to 81.51% after single adaptation cycle under uncalibrated hardware

## Executive Summary
maxVSTAR addresses domain shift challenges in edge-deployed human activity recognition systems by introducing a closed-loop vision-guided CSI sensing framework. The system employs a YOLO-based vision model as a dynamic teacher to provide real-time supervisory labels for a lightweight CSI-based HAR model, enabling autonomous online fine-tuning directly on edge devices without cloud intervention. By combining cross-modal teacher-student architecture with hardware-software synchronization via GPS PPS signals, maxVSTAR achieves robust activity recognition while preserving privacy through event-triggered camera activation. The framework demonstrates significant accuracy recovery (from 49.14% to 81.51%) after domain shift, establishing a practical solution for long-term autonomous HAR in privacy-sensitive IoT environments.

## Method Summary
maxVSTAR implements a cross-modal teacher-student architecture where an enhanced YOLOv8 vision model serves as a supervisory signal for a CSI-based HAR model (STAR). The system operates in closed-loop mode, monitoring inference confidence and triggering camera activation only when performance degrades below threshold. During adaptation, GPS PPS synchronization ensures precise temporal alignment between CSI packets and video frames, enabling accurate label transfer. The STAR model (3-layer GRU) is fine-tuned on newly labeled CSI data using standard backpropagation with Adam optimizer (lr=0.0001, 50 epochs). The enhanced YOLOv8-C2f_iRMB teacher model achieves 70.3% precision, providing reliable supervision while minimizing privacy intrusion through event-triggered operation.

## Key Results
- Recovered baseline STAR model accuracy from 49.14% to 81.51% after single adaptation cycle
- Enhanced YOLOv8-C2f_iRMB teacher achieved 21% improvement in precision (70.3% vs baseline 48.4%)
- Maintained real-time operation with <50ms inference latency on edge hardware
- Demonstrated privacy preservation through event-triggered camera activation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Label Transfer (Vision-to-CSI)
The system uses an enhanced YOLOv8 model to detect human poses in video frames, converting detections to activity labels mapped to synchronized CSI timestamps. The STAR model is then fine-tuned on this newly labeled CSI data. This works because the visual model is robust to environmental changes that degrade the CSI model, and its >70% precision ensures reliable supervision. Break condition: if vision model precision drops significantly, noisy labels will degrade CSI model further.

### Mechanism 2: Hardware-Level Temporal Alignment
GPS PPS signals provide global truth timestamps for both CSI and image streams, ensuring nanosecond-scale synchronization. Both streams are timestamped using hardware counters locked to PPS, then paired based on these timestamps. This works because the jitter introduced by SPI and MIPI interfaces can be bounded to represent the same physical moment. Break condition: loss of GPS lock or excessive interrupt latency breaks temporal pairing.

### Mechanism 3: Confidence-Triggered Closed-Loop Adaptation
The system monitors STAR inference confidence and triggers adaptation only when expected confidence drops below threshold. This closed-loop approach ensures the system remains static (privacy-preserving) until performance degradation is detected. Works because confidence drop correlates with domain shift rather than natural signal variance. Break condition: false positives in trigger mechanism cause unnecessary camera activation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: CSI (Channel State Information)**
  - Why needed: Core sensing signal providing fine-grained amplitude/phase data across subcarriers for movement detection through walls
  - Quick check: Why is CSI preferred over RSSI for fine-grained activity recognition (e.g., distinguishing "sitting" from "falling")?

- **Concept: Domain Shift**
  - Why needed: Problem statement hinges on model trained on Hardware A/Room A failing on Hardware B/Room B due to changed signal propagation physics
  - Quick check: If you train a CSI model in an empty room and move it to a furnished room, why does accuracy drop even if activity is the same?

- **Concept: Knowledge Distillation (Teacher-Student)**
  - Why needed: Adaptation strategy where "Teacher" (Vision) transfers knowledge (labels) to "Student" (CSI) without human labeling
  - Quick check: In maxVSTAR, does the Teacher model run continuously or is it triggered? Why is this distinction important for privacy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Detection Node (Rockchip RV1126 + ESP32-S3 + Sony IMX577) -> Training Node (ARM Cortex-A76 / RTX 4060Ti) -> Sync Hardware (GPS Module)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Monitor: Detection Node tracks STAR inference confidence
  2. Trigger: Confidence drops -> Camera activates
  3. Sync: GPS PPS timestamps both CSI packets and Video frames
  4. Label: YOLO processes Video -> Labels generated
  5. Align: Software pairs CSI data with YOLO labels based on timestamps
  6. Adapt: Labeled CSI sent to Training Node -> STAR fine-tuned (50 epochs)
  7. Deploy: New STAR weights pushed back to Detection Node

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Precision vs. Recall: Optimized YOLO for Precision (70.3%) over Recall (35.6%) to ensure correct labels during training
  - Privacy vs. Robustness: Camera off during normal operation, accepts temporary privacy intrusion during adaptation for long-term privacy-preserving operation

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Perpetual Adaptation Loop: Camera turns on/off rapidly, indicating confidence threshold is too high or model oscillates
  - Sync Drift: Training loss fails to decrease, indicating labels and data are misaligned in time
  - NPU Memory Overflow: Attempting to run YOLO on 4K streams without proper downscaling

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline Drift Characterization: Deploy pretrained STAR on uncalibrated hardware, quantify accuracy drop (verify 93.5% -> 49% drop)
  2. Teacher Validation: Run YOLOv8-C2f_iRMB on validation set, specifically check Precision metric for reliable supervision
  3. Synchronization Latency Test: Trigger flash/light pulse, record timestamp difference between Camera frame and CSI packet to verify temporal alignment bounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can feature-level multi-modal fusion achieve higher recognition accuracy and faster adaptation than current sequential supervision paradigm? (Current framework operates in cross-modal sequential supervision rather than fully integrated multi-modal fusion; exploring feature-level fusion strategies is future research direction)

- Can unsupervised domain adaptation methods reduce or eliminate need for vision-based supervision during edge deployment? (Paper lists unsupervised domain adaptation techniques as future research direction to enhance autonomy and generalizability; all current adaptation relies on labeled CSI samples from YOLO teacher)

- How does maxVSTAR's adaptation performance scale when expanding beyond seven activities to larger, more diverse activity sets in uncontrolled environments? (Evaluations conducted within constrained activity set and indoor environment; generalization to more classes and open-world settings is untested)

- Can continual or few-shot learning algorithms enable stable, incremental adaptation without catastrophic forgetting over multiple successive domain shifts? (Only single adaptation cycle evaluated; repeated shifts may degrade previously learned activities if model weights are overwritten)

## Limitations

- Hardware synchronization complexity: GPS PPS-based synchronization assumes low-jitter hardware and stable GPS reception; alternative timestamp alignment methods not specified for GPS-unavailable environments
- Teacher model precision threshold: System requires >70% precision for reliable supervision, but no sensitivity analysis showing performance degradation as precision drops from 70% to 50%
- Adaptation scope: Reported recovery from 49.14% to 81.51% after one cycle, but long-term stability and multi-cycle adaptation performance unknown

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Cross-modal adaptation mechanism well-supported by experimental results showing significant accuracy recovery; technical description of C2f_iRMB block integration and training parameters sufficiently detailed
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of confidence-triggered adaptation relies on correlation between inference confidence and domain shift; specific threshold value and robustness across conditions not provided
- **Low Confidence**: Scalability claims to "privacy-sensitive IoT environments" not fully validated; camera requirement for adaptation contradicts privacy-preserving goal during adaptation phase

## Next Checks

1. Precision Sensitivity Test: Systematically vary YOLO teacher model's precision from 50% to 90% and measure resulting CSI model accuracy after adaptation to establish minimum viable teacher performance threshold

2. Multi-Cycle Adaptation Stability: Deploy adapted model in new domain, allow operation, then introduce second domain shift; measure whether model can adapt again or experiences catastrophic forgetting of first adaptation

3. GPS-Independent Synchronization: Implement alternative timestamp synchronization method (hardware trigger or NTP) and validate temporal alignment error remains below critical threshold for accurate cross-modal label transfer
