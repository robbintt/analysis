core_contribution: This paper addresses the lack of automatic performance diagnosis
  and interpretable training guidance in existing intelligent sports analysis systems,
  which often focus only on scoring and visualization. To solve this, the authors

# SportsGPT: An LLM-driven Framework for Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment and Training Guidance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.14121
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14121
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: SportsGPT achieves significantly better alignment accuracy and expert-assessed diagnostic quality compared to general LLMs, closing the loop from video input to actionable training guidance.

## Executive Summary
SportsGPT is an LLM-driven framework that interprets sports motion from video and generates actionable training guidance. The system uses MotionDTW, a two-stage time-series alignment algorithm, to extract precise keyframes from long, untrimmed sports videos. These keyframes are assessed by KISMAM, a knowledge-based model that maps biomechanical deviations to interpretable assessment metrics. Finally, SportsRAG retrieves domain-specific knowledge to generate professional training recommendations. Experimental results show MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores, while ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of KISMAM and SportsRAG in improving diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of training advice.

## Method Summary
The framework processes sports video through four stages: (1) Pose estimation extracts skeleton data from video input, (2) MotionDTW performs coarse-to-fine alignment to identify keyframes, (3) KISMAM compares user motion to elite reference models and generates semantic assessment metrics, and (4) SportsRAG retrieves relevant training protocols from a large knowledge base to generate actionable guidance. The system was evaluated on the Athletics Motion Analysis Benchmark with 390 video sequences across five motion categories, using expert human raters to assess diagnostic quality and training guidance on a 1-5 Likert scale.

## Key Results
- MotionDTW achieves 1.54 frame temporal error versus 66.00 frames for one-stage strategies
- KISMAM improves diagnostic accuracy from 2.85 to 3.9 on expert Likert scale
- SportsRAG maintains feasibility scores at 3.9, preventing collapse to 1.65 without retrieval
- System generates actionable recommendations like "4 sets of 8 reps" versus generic advice

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The two-stage alignment strategy prevents catastrophic failure when applying standard DTW to long, untrimmed sports videos.
- **Mechanism:** MotionDTW uses a coarse-to-fine strategy: first locates the rough action interval through subsequence search, then performs fine-grained warping path mapping to reference keyframes.
- **Core assumption:** Global alignment on untrimmed video causes divergence; constrained local search is prerequisite for convergence.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error. [section 4.3] Ablation shows One-Stage strategy results in 66.00 to 76.81 frame errors, whereas Two-Stage strategy achieves 1.54 frames.
- **Break condition:** If input video is already perfectly trimmed to action, benefit of first stage diminishes, potentially making standard DTW competitive.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Mapping quantitative biomechanical deviations to qualitative semantics enables LLM to generate actionable diagnoses rather than hallucinating on raw numbers.
- **Mechanism:** KISMAM acts as semantic bridge, aggregating probabilities of specific technical issues from multiple kinematic deviations via mapping matrix, conditioning LLM with structured problem set.
- **Core assumption:** General LLMs struggle to reason directly over numerical joint angles without intermediate semantic abstraction layer.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] KISMAM obtains interpretable assessment metrics by contrasting keyframes with target models. [section 4.3] Ablation shows Accuracy drops from 3.9 to 2.85 without KISMAM.
- **Break condition:** If mapping matrix W is incomplete or thresholds T_min/T_max mis-calibrated for specific user demographic, semantic diagnosis will be erroneous regardless of LLM capabilities.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is primary driver for converting diagnosis into feasible, professional training plan.
- **Mechanism:** SportsRAG retrieves specific intervention protocols and textbook theory using KISMAM assessment vector as query, grounding LLM generation in verified expert data.
- **Core assumption:** General LLMs lack specific "load management" and "periodization" knowledge required for professional sports training.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] SportsRAG prompts LLM to generate professional guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. [section 4.3] Ablation shows Feasibility drops catastrophically from 3.9 to 1.65 without RAG.
- **Break condition:** If knowledge base lacks coverage for specific detected error, LLM may still hallucinate solution despite RAG architecture.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**
  - **Why needed here:** SportsGPT builds MotionDTW on top of this algorithm. Understand that standard DTW aligns sequences of different lengths/speeds but has O(N^2) complexity and sensitivity to noise.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would standard DTW fail to find a "walking" sequence inside a 10-minute video of a person entering a room, walking, and leaving?

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - **Why needed here:** System uses RAG to bridge gap between "diagnosis" and "feasible advice." Understand difference between parametric knowledge (weights) and non-parametric knowledge (retrieval database).
  - **Quick check question:** If LLM generates weightlifting plan that contradicts retrieved textbook, which source should ideally take precedence and why?

- **Concept: Skeleton-based Pose Estimation**
  - **Why needed here:** This is raw input modality. System relies on converting video pixels into joint coordinates (angles/velocities). Know this step is prerequisite and potential source of error (jitter).
  - **Quick check question:** How does using "angular velocity" (derivative of angle) help distinguish fast punch from slow wave, compared to just using joint positions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video → Pose Estimation → MotionDTW → Keyframes → KISMAM → Assessment Metrics → SportsRAG → Training Guidance

- **Critical path:** MotionDTW Two-Stage Strategy. If temporal alignment is off by >2 frames, kinematic values extracted at keyframes will be incorrect, cascading into wrong diagnoses and irrelevant training advice.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - MotionDTW vs. Standard DTW: Trades theoretical exactness for linear O(N) complexity and robustness to "redundant frames" (pre/post action)
  - KISMAM vs. End-to-End LLM: Trades flexibility of end-to-end model for interpretability and stability of rule-based mapping layer

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Alignment Collapse: If search radius r in MotionDTW is too small, algorithm fails to converge (error > 60 frames)
  - Generic Advice: If RAG retrieval fails, output becomes vague ("keep core stable") rather than quantitative ("4 sets of 8 reps")

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify Alignment Stability: Run MotionDTW on provided 100m sprint dataset (Acceleration phase) with and without "Two-Stage" flag to reproduce catastrophic error gap (1.54 vs 66.00 frames)
  2. Semantic Ablation: Input raw joint angles directly into LLM vs. KISMAM output to verify "Accuracy" drop reported in ablation study
  3. RAG Retrieval Quality: Query SportsRAG module with specific problem vector (e.g., "knee valgus") and inspect Top-K retrieved chunks to ensure they match specific biomechanical context before LLM generates final text

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can adaptive hyperparameter optimization and multi-reference voting mechanisms be integrated into MotionDTW to mitigate bias and handle extreme stylistic variations?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state they plan to "upgrade MotionDTW by incorporating adaptive hyperparameter optimization and a multi-reference voting mechanism to handle extreme stylistic variations and mitigate the bias inherent in relying on a single reference sequence."
- **Why unresolved:** Current MotionDTW framework relies on single standard template for alignment, which may fail to accurately assess users with highly divergent or idiosyncratic movement styles.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstrated improvements in alignment accuracy (IoU) and temporal error rates when processing motion sequences from athletes with non-standard techniques compared to single-reference baseline.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can SportsGPT framework maintain diagnostic accuracy and generation quality when applied to complex, multi-modal sports disciplines outside of athletics?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion notes intent to "expand our benchmark to cover diverse sporting disciplines (e.g., gymnastics, ball games)."
- **Why unresolved:** System has currently only been validated on "Athletics Motion Analysis" dataset (sprinting and standing long jump), leaving generalizability to sports with different biomechanical constraints unproven.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful benchmarking results (keyframe error and expert evaluation scores) on newly constructed datasets for sports like gymnastics or soccer.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does interpretable training guidance generated by SportsGPT result in measurable performance improvements in longitudinal, real-world athletic training scenarios?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors list as future work plan to "conduct longitudinal intervention studies to empirically validate system's practical efficacy in real-world athletic training scenarios."
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation relies on double-blind expert scoring of report quality (Accuracy, Feasibility) rather than quantitative metrics of athletic performance improvement over time.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Data from longitudinal studies showing statistically significant improvement in athlete performance metrics (e.g., sprint times, jump distances) for groups using SportsGPT guidance compared to control groups.

## Limitations
- Performance highly dependent on quality of pose estimation, which can introduce significant errors in noisy or occluded video conditions
- KISMAM mapping matrix W and biomechanical thresholds are not publicly available, making faithful reproduction challenging without domain expertise
- SportsRAG knowledge base containing 200 textbooks and 50k expert QA pairs is proprietary and critical to system's feasibility scores

## Confidence
- **High Confidence** - Claims about MotionDTW's superior alignment accuracy (1.54 vs 66.00 frame error) supported by direct ablation evidence in paper
- **Medium Confidence** - Claims about KISMAM's role in improving diagnostic accuracy (3.9→2.85) well-supported, but generalizability of semantic mapping across different sports remains uncertain
- **Low Confidence** - Claims about SportsRAG's ability to generate professional training guidance depend heavily on proprietary knowledge base quality, which cannot be independently verified

## Next Checks
1. **Alignment Stability Test**: Reproduce MotionDTW two-stage strategy on provided 100m sprint dataset, specifically measuring frame error gap between one-stage (66.00) and two-stage (1.54) approaches
2. **Semantic Layer Ablation**: Test LLM directly with raw joint angles versus KISMAM-processed semantic problems to verify reported accuracy drop from 3.9 to 2.85
3. **RAG Retrieval Verification**: Input specific biomechanical problem vector (e.g., "knee valgus") into SportsRAG and examine top-K retrieved knowledge chunks to confirm they contain sport-specific protocols rather than generic fitness advice
