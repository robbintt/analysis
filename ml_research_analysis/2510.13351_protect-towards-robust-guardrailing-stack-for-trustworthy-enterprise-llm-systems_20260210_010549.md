# Protect: Towards Robust Guardrailing Stack for Trustworthy Enterprise LLM Systems

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13351

- Multi-modal guardrailing framework for enterprise LLM safety, achieving state-of-the-art text-based safety benchmark performance

## Executive Summary
Protect is a multi-modal guardrailing framework designed to ensure enterprise LLM systems are trustworthy and safe. It integrates text, image, and audio modalities, addressing four key safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. The framework leverages fine-tuned LoRA adapters trained on a large, multi-modal dataset with teacher-assisted relabeling to improve accuracy and explainability. Protect surpasses commercial and open-source baselines in accuracy and minority-class F1 scores while maintaining low latency for real-time applications.

## Method Summary
Protect employs a multi-modal guardrailing approach that combines text, image, and audio safety checks. The system uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters fine-tuned for four safety dimensions—toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection—trained on a large, multi-modal dataset. Teacher-assisted relabeling is used to enhance data quality and explainability. The framework is designed for low-latency deployment in enterprise environments, enabling real-time safety filtering of LLM inputs and outputs.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-based safety benchmarks, outperforming commercial and open-source baselines.
- Surpasses baselines in accuracy and minority-class F1 scores across toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection dimensions.
- Maintains low latency suitable for real-time enterprise LLM applications.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Protect's effectiveness stems from its multi-modal architecture and fine-tuned LoRA adapters, which enable precise safety filtering across text, image, and audio inputs. The use of teacher-assisted relabeling improves data quality and model explainability, while the modular design allows for efficient deployment in enterprise environments. The framework's focus on four critical safety dimensions ensures comprehensive protection against common LLM risks.

## Foundational Learning

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that modifies pre-trained models with low-rank matrices.  
*Why needed*: Reduces computational cost while maintaining high performance for safety-specific tasks.  
*Quick check*: Verify that LoRA adapters achieve comparable accuracy to full fine-tuning with fewer parameters.

**Teacher-Assisted Relabeling**: A semi-automated labeling process where a teacher model guides human annotators to improve data quality.  
*Why needed*: Enhances label accuracy and consistency, critical for training reliable safety classifiers.  
*Quick check*: Compare inter-annotator agreement before and after teacher-assisted relabeling.

**Multi-Modal Safety Filtering**: Simultaneous evaluation of text, image, and audio inputs for safety violations.  
*Why needed*: Enterprises often process diverse data types, requiring holistic safety checks.  
*Quick check*: Test the framework on mixed-modal inputs to ensure consistent safety detection.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Modalities -> LoRA Adapters -> Safety Classifier -> Guardrail Decision  
**Critical Path**: Input (text/image/audio) -> LoRA adapter fine-tuning -> Safety classification -> Guardrail enforcement  
**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes low latency over exhaustive safety checks, balancing speed and accuracy for real-time applications.  
**Failure Signatures**: False negatives in minority classes, latency spikes under high load, or misclassification of ambiguous inputs.  
**First Experiments**:  
1. Benchmark accuracy and latency on a synthetic multi-modal dataset.  
2. Evaluate robustness to adversarial prompts and multimodal attacks.  
3. Test scalability under concurrent enterprise workloads.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit gaps include the need for broader safety dimension coverage, real-world deployment validation, and robustness testing against emerging threats.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on four safety dimensions, omitting bias amplification and fairness across demographic groups.
- Reliance on human annotators for labeling introduces subjectivity and scalability concerns.
- Lack of extensive real-world deployment validation in diverse enterprise contexts.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in technical architecture and benchmark improvements, supported by quantitative comparisons and ablation studies.
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability across all enterprise use cases due to limited safety dimension scope and absence of long-term deployment data.
- **Low confidence** in robustness to novel or emerging safety threats not covered in current training and evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-stakeholder red-teaming exercises to identify blind spots in current safety dimensions, especially around bias and fairness.
2. Perform large-scale deployment trials in diverse enterprise environments to measure real-world effectiveness and latency under production loads.
3. Expand evaluation to include adversarial robustness tests and emerging threat categories (e.g., jailbreak attempts, multimodal adversarial examples).
