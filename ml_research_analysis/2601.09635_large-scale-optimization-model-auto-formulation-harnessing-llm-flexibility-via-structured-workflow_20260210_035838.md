# Large-Scale Optimization Model Auto-Formulation: Harnessing LLM Flexibility via Structured Workflow

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.09635
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09635
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LEAN-LLM-OPT achieves 76%+ accuracy on large-scale optimization problems, outperforming Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.2

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LEAN-LLM-OPT, an agentic workflow framework that automates large-scale optimization model formulation using large language models. The approach leverages structured workflows to guide downstream agents through step-by-step reasoning while offloading mechanical data handling to specialized tools. The framework demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art models, achieving 76%+ accuracy across multiple benchmarks and practical applications in Singapore Airlines revenue management.

## Method Summary
LEAN-LLM-OPT employs a novel agentic workflow framework that dynamically constructs structured workflows to guide optimization model formulation. The system uses large language models to interpret problem descriptions and systematically break down complex optimization tasks into manageable components. By combining LLM flexibility with specialized tooling for data handling and computational tasks, the framework achieves high accuracy on large-scale problems while requiring minimal labeled training data compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves 76%+ accuracy on large-scale optimization problems across multiple benchmarks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models including Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.2
- Demonstrates practical value in Singapore Airlines revenue management use case with consistent high performance in fare type allocation and network planning scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its structured workflow approach that combines LLM reasoning capabilities with specialized tool integration. By breaking down complex optimization problems into systematic steps, LEAN-LLM-OPT reduces cognitive load on the LLM while ensuring comprehensive problem coverage. The dynamic workflow construction allows adaptation to different problem types while maintaining consistency in the formulation process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Agentic workflows**: Autonomous multi-step reasoning processes that guide problem-solving - needed for systematic optimization formulation, quick check: verify workflow captures all problem constraints
- **Structured problem decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable components - needed for handling large-scale optimization, quick check: confirm decomposition maintains problem integrity
- **Tool integration**: Specialized utilities for mechanical data handling - needed to reduce LLM workload on routine tasks, quick check: verify tool outputs align with workflow requirements
- **Dynamic workflow construction**: Adaptive workflow generation based on problem characteristics - needed for flexibility across problem types, quick check: test workflow adaptation on diverse problem sets

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Problem Description -> Structured Workflow Generator -> Specialized Tool Integration -> Optimization Model Formulation -> Validation Engine

**Critical path**: Problem description parsing → Workflow construction → Tool-assisted data processing → Model formulation → Validation and refinement

**Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. structure (structured workflows improve reliability but may limit creative solutions), accuracy vs. efficiency (comprehensive workflows improve accuracy but increase computational overhead), generalization vs. specialization (broad applicability vs. domain-specific performance)

**Failure signatures**: Incomplete constraint capture, inconsistent variable definitions, computational tool integration failures, workflow adaptation issues for novel problem types

**3 first experiments**:
1. Test workflow generation on standard benchmark optimization problems
2. Validate tool integration with sample data processing tasks
3. Evaluate end-to-end performance on simplified revenue management scenarios
