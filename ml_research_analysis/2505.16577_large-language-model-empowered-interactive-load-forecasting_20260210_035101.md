# Large Language Model-Empowered Interactive Load Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16577
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Interactive human guidance through a multi-agent LLM framework improves load forecasting accuracy while maintaining practical token costs.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a large language model-based multi-agent collaboration framework to support interactive load forecasting. The framework reduces technical barriers for non-expert users by enabling natural language interaction throughout the forecasting pipeline, from data preparation to model deployment and post-processing. Specialized agents handle distinct stages while communicating via a topic-based messaging system, allowing users to incorporate domain knowledge and contextual insights. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that interactive human guidance improves forecasting accuracy compared to automated approaches. The framework achieves lower mean absolute errors while maintaining practical token costs, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a five-agent architecture (Task Manager, Preparation Assistant, Model Manager, Model Developer, Deployment Operator) using AutoGen for topic-based messaging and GPT-4o as the LLM backend. The interactive pipeline operates in three stages: data preparation (cleaning, feature selection, metric definition), model training/evaluation (interactive Bayesian optimization with user-guided model selection and hyperparameter tuning), and deployment (post-processing with user-defined transformations). The Model Manager uses Optuna for batch Bayesian optimization (B=10) and incorporates user feedback as "External Guidance" to prune search space or adjust acquisition functions. The system supports 24-hour-ahead forecasting using datasets with load, temperature, and auxiliary features like humidity, precipitation, and holidays.

## Key Results
- Interactive human guidance reduced MAE from 73.41 to 68.23 by preventing Bayesian optimization from stagnating in local minima
- Post-deployment manual adjustments during extreme weather events lowered MAPE from 6.99% to 3.28%
- The framework achieved lower forecasting errors compared to fully automated approaches while maintaining practical token costs
- Task Manager consumed 47.2% of input tokens due to maintaining full conversation history

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interactive guidance appears to prevent Bayesian optimization from stagnating in local minima during model selection.
- Mechanism: The Model Manager integrates user feedback as "External Guidance" (G) to prune the search space ($S'$) or impose preferences on the acquisition function, overriding the default statistical sampling.
- Core assumption: The user correctly identifies promising model types or hyperparameter ranges based on intermediate visualization, and the LLM correctly interprets this intent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-B1] Figure 6 shows the vanilla method stuck on Linear models, while user guidance successfully shifted the search to MLP/CNN, improving MAE from 73.41 to 68.23.
  - [abstract] States "human-guided model optimization... significantly improve[s] forecasting accuracy."
- Break condition: If the user provides misleading guidance or if the LLM fails to map natural language advice to the specific constraints of the search space, performance may degrade below automated baselines.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Natural language interfaces likely reduce the operational barrier by mapping semantic intent to rigid API calls.
- Mechanism: The Task Manager agent acts as an abstraction layer, translating user instructions into specific "tool calls" (e.g., `EnqueueTrial`) that non-experts would not be able to code manually.
- Core assumption: The underlying tool definitions are robust enough to cover the variability of user requests.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-B] Describes the Task Manager's "Action" component utilizing `FunctionTool` to bridge natural language and system execution.
  - [corpus] "Zero-shot Load Forecasting..." (arXiv:2502.16896) supports the general capability of LLMs to handle forecasting tasks, though this paper specifically targets the *interactive* translation layer.
- Break condition: If the complexity of the request exceeds the defined tool scope, the LLM may "hallucinate" parameters or fail to execute the pipeline.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Post-deployment adjustments allow the system to incorporate exogenous context that trained models miss.
- Mechanism: The Deployment Operator applies user-defined transformations $g(\cdot)$, such as time-based scaling during extreme weather, which the statistical model could not predict from historical data alone.
- Core assumption: The operator has accurate real-time information (e.g., knowledge of a typhoon's severity) that correlates with load reduction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-B2] Demonstrates a manual 10% reduction during "Typhoon Saola" lowering MAPE from 6.99% to 3.28%.
  - [corpus] "From Dense to Sparse..." (arXiv:2501.02781) reinforces that event-response is a distinct and critical pattern in residential load forecasting.
- Break condition: If the user overrides the model based on bias rather than real signal, cumulative forecast error will increase.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Bayesian Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The Model Manager relies on this to traverse the hyperparameter search space. You must understand the trade-off between "exploration" (trying new areas) and "exploitation" (refining known good areas) to diagnose why user intervention is helpful.
  - Quick check question: If a surrogate model predicts high uncertainty in a specific region of the search space, should the acquisition function prioritize or avoid that region?

- Concept: **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: The Model Manager uses a "Thought" then "Action" loop. Understanding this helps in debugging why an agent might "think" it needs data but take the wrong action to get it.
  - Quick check question: In a ReAct loop, if an agent produces an "Action" without a preceding "Thought" trace, what is the risk?

- Concept: **Power System Load Dynamics**
  - Why needed here: The system is not purely software; it interacts with physical constraints (e.g., temperature, holidays).
  - Quick check question: Why would a model trained on historical data fail to predict the load drop during a sudden, unprecendented weather event?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - User Intent -> Task Manager (Translation) -> Preparation/Model Agents (Execution) -> Visualization Panel -> User Feedback -> Model Manager (Strategy Update)

- Critical path:
  User Intent $\to$ Task Manager (Translation) $\to$ Preparation/Model Agents (Execution) $\to$ Visualization Panel $\to$ User Feedback $\to$ Model Manager (Strategy Update)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Token Cost vs. Memory**: The Task Manager consumes 47.2% of input tokens [Section IV-C] because it maintains full conversation history. Truncating history saves cost but risks losing context.
  - **Agent Specialization**: Separating "Planning" (Manager) from "Execution" (Developer) reduces prompt complexity but adds latency due to inter-agent messaging overhead.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Infinite Clarification Loops**: The Task Manager repeatedly asks the user for "metadata" it cannot parse.
  - **Search Stagnation**: The Model Manager ignores user guidance and continues sampling from a poor-performing subspace.
  - **Tool Call Errors**: The Model Developer hallucinates a parameter name (e.g., `learning_rate='fast'` instead of a float), crashing the trial.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline Run**: Execute the pipeline on the provided GEFCom2014 dataset with *zero* user intervention to verify the automated Bayesian optimization loop establishes a valid MAE baseline.
  2. **The "Oracle" Intervention**: Deliberately force the Model Manager to select a specific model (e.g., XGBoost) via natural language command to verify the "External Guidance" parsing is functional.
  3. **Post-Processing Stress Test**: Inject a synthetic "holiday" anomaly into the test set and use the Deployment Operator to apply a manual scaling factor to confirm the post-processing logic executes correctly.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can summarization-based memory compression and multilevel memory modules be implemented to reduce token overhead in long multi-agent conversations while maintaining task coherence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "For future work, advanced memory management methods will be further investigated, such as summarization-based memory compression and multilevel memory modules."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation accumulates full conversational history, causing the Task Manager to consume 47.2% of total input tokens.
- What evidence would resolve it: Token consumption benchmarks showing reduced input overhead with maintained forecasting accuracy across extended multi-turn interactions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can explainable AI (XAI) techniques be integrated into the multi-agent framework to provide clearer reasoning behind model outputs and enhance user trust?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states: "Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be integrated into the framework to provide users with clearer reasoning behind model outputs, further enhancing trust and transparency in the interaction process."
- Why unresolved: The current visualization panel shows predictions and performance metrics but does not explain model decisions or agent reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies measuring trust, decision confidence, and task success rates with and without XAI-enhanced explanations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does user expertise level affect the performance gains from human-in-the-loop interaction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions users "with basic understanding of AI techniques" can achieve better results, but does not systematically evaluate how expertise affects outcomes or how to adapt interactions for novices.
- Why unresolved: The framework aims to be "flexible and inclusive" but provides no empirical guidance on supporting users with varying backgrounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing forecasting accuracy and interaction efficiency across user groups with different AI expertise levels.

## Limitations
- Full system prompts for all five agents are not provided, only a simplified Task Manager example
- Core optimization mechanism depends on specific tool implementations and user feedback integration that remain underspecified
- Evaluation only compares against automated optimization, not other LLM-based or interactive forecasting systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The framework architecture (5-agent structure, topic-based messaging, multi-stage workflow) is clearly specified and implementable. The core claim that interactive guidance can improve forecast accuracy beyond automated optimization is supported by the experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism by which natural language feedback effectively guides Bayesian optimization is plausible but relies on assumptions about user expertise and LLM interpretation fidelity that aren't fully validated.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about practical deployment readiness are premature without longer-term validation, cost analysis beyond token counts, or evaluation on datasets with more diverse load patterns and extreme events.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Run the complete interactive pipeline on a third, independent load forecasting dataset (e.g., ISO New England data) to verify the framework's effectiveness isn't dataset-specific and that the user guidance mechanism generalizes across different load patterns and geographical regions.

2. **User expertise variation study**: Conduct controlled experiments with users of varying domain expertise levels (novice, intermediate, expert) providing identical guidance scenarios to quantify how user knowledge quality affects forecast improvement and identify the minimum expertise threshold for positive ROI.

3. **Automated vs. interactive ablation study**: Implement a semi-automated version that automatically detects optimization stagnation (e.g., through variance metrics) and injects model diversity without user input, then compare performance against both fully automated and fully interactive approaches to isolate the value-add of human-in-the-loop guidance.
