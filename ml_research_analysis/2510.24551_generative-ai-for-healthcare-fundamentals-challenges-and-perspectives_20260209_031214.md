# Generative AI for Healthcare: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Perspectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24551
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: SAGE-Health demonstrates retrieval-augmented generation improves clinical precision in chest X-ray reports through clinician-driven data-model co-evolution

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SAGE-Health, a data-centric framework for deploying generative AI in healthcare that addresses fragmentation and heterogeneity of medical data. The core innovation is a two-tier lakehouse architecture that integrates multimodal medical data with semantic enrichment for contextual retrieval, enabling adaptive GenAI with privacy-preserving intelligence. The framework includes an agentic collaboration layer for task-specific reasoning and demonstrates improved medical report generation through retrieval-augmented generation, with clinician feedback driving continuous data-model co-evolution.

## Method Summary
The method involves a two-tier Medical Data Lakehouse architecture that preserves raw multimodal data in the first tier and curated semantic assets in the second tier. Vector search using BioViL-T encoder retrieves similar cases for retrieval-augmented generation with HealthGPT as the backbone. PEFT is used for model adaptation, and clinician corrections are captured and propagated through data-oriented agents to relabel and re-index similar cases. The framework was validated using the MIMIC-CXR dataset for chest X-ray report generation, comparing retrieval-augmented outputs against baseline models.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-augmented generation shows better clinical precision in chest X-ray report generation compared to baseline models
- Clinician feedback corrections (e.g., "pneumonia" to "atelectasis") propagate to similar cases through relabeling and re-indexing
- The two-tier lakehouse architecture enables unified querying across heterogeneous medical data modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation improves clinical precision in chest X-ray report generation compared to baseline models.
- Mechanism: The Vector Search Engine (HAKES) retrieves semantically similar cases from the curated semantic data tier using vision encoders (BioViL-T). These retrieved cases are injected into the prompt context, providing concrete precedents that ground the foundation model's generation in empirically observed patterns rather than generic priors.
- Core assumption: The retrieval corpus contains sufficiently similar cases with correct labels; embedding similarity correlates with clinical relevance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results include enhanced accuracy in chest X-ray report generation, with retrieval-augmented outputs showing better clinical precision compared to baseline models."
  - [section 5.5.2]: Figure 7 demonstrates baseline reports without retrieval relying on "generic or partially incomplete descriptions, whereas retrieval-augmented outputs incorporate precise, clinically meaningful phrases that are directly traceable to retrieved examples."
  - [corpus]: Limited direct replication evidence in corpus; related work on LLM-based agents (arXiv:2502.11211) surveys similar approaches but does not independently validate this specific RAG mechanism.
- Break condition: Retrieval fails when query images have no sufficiently similar cases in the archive (low similarity scores), or when the embedding space poorly captures clinical semantics (e.g., visual similarity without pathological correspondence).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Clinician feedback can drive continuous data-model co-evolution without requiring full model retraining.
- Mechanism: Clinician corrections are captured at the application layer, routed through Data-oriented Agents with task metadata and provenance, then reintegrated into the Sustainable Medical Data Ecosystem via relabeling and re-indexing. The updated retrieval context reshapes future generation, creating a feedback loop where data quality improvements propagate to model behavior.
- Core assumption: Clinicians provide corrections at sufficient volume and quality; error patterns are systematic rather than idiosyncratic; propagation to "similar cases" (mentioned in Figure 8) correctly identifies related instances.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The system demonstrates...how clinician feedback can drive continuous data-model co-evolution."
  - [section 5.5.2]: Figure 8 illustrates a case where feedback corrected "pneumonia" to "atelectasis," triggering relabeling and propagation: "By reshaping the retrieval context, the system ensures that when the same image is reprocessed, the report moves from an uncertain pneumonia diagnosis to a precise description of atelectasis."
  - [corpus]: No independent validation of feedback-driven co-evolution in corpus; corpus focuses on regulatory challenges and performance assessment frameworks rather than empirical feedback loop studies.
- Break condition: Feedback loop breaks if correction volume is too low for statistical significance, if propagated corrections affect dissimilar cases (introducing noise), or if governance agents block legitimate updates due to overly conservative policy enforcement.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A two-tier lakehouse architecture with semantic enrichment enables unified querying across fragmented, heterogeneous medical data modalities.
- Mechanism: Raw multimodal data (EHRs, imaging, signals) is preserved in the first tier while derived semantic assets (embeddings, knowledge graphs) are maintained in the second tier. The Data Query Engine handles structured/unstructured access to raw data; the Vector Search Engine handles high-dimensional retrieval across embeddings. Together they enable cross-modal retrieval without requiring upfront schema unification.
- Core assumption: Embedding models adequately represent cross-modal semantics; semantic enrichment pipelines can keep pace with data ingestion; provenance tracking remains consistent across tiers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SAGE-Health integrates multimodal medical data through a two-tier lakehouse architecture and provides semantic enrichment for contextual retrieval."
  - [section 5.2]: "We categorize heterogeneous medical data into two interdependent tiers, raw multimodal data...and curated semantic data...To accommodate both, we propose a two-tier Medical Data Lakehouse architecture."
  - [corpus]: Corpus mentions data governance challenges (arXiv:2503.04736) but does not independently validate lakehouse architectures for healthcare GenAI.
- Break condition: Architecture fails when semantic enrichment lags behind raw data ingestion (stale embeddings), when cross-modal alignment is poor (retrieved context semantically mismatched), or when governance overhead blocks timely data access.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: The framework's primary inference mechanism depends on grounding generation in retrieved evidence; without understanding RAG, the relationship between the Vector Search Engine and report quality is opaque.
  - Quick check question: Given a chest X-ray with an unusual finding, how would you determine if RAG will help or hurt output quality?

- Concept: Foundation Model Adaptation (PEFT, SFT, prompting)
  - Why needed here: The Model Adaptation Hub exposes multiple adaptation strategies; selecting the right approach requires understanding trade-offs between data requirements, compute cost, and specialization depth.
  - Quick check question: A clinician reports systematic errors in rare disease detection. Would you address this via prompting, PEFT, or full SFT—and what data would you need?

- Concept: Agentic Orchestration (task decomposition, agent coordination)
  - Why needed here: The Agentic Collaboration Layer decomposes clinical tasks into subtasks handled by specialized agents; understanding this orchestration is essential for debugging failures and extending capabilities.
  - Quick check question: A report generation task times out after the retrieval step. Which agent class should you investigate first, and what orchestration state would help diagnose the issue?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Layer 1 (Data): Medical Data Lakehouse (raw tier + semantic tier) → Data Query Engine + Vector Search Engine → Intelligent Data Management & Governance
  - Layer 2 (GenAI): Foundation Model Zoo ← Model Adaptation Hub ← Privacy-Preserving Intelligence
  - Layer 3 (Agentic): Core Orchestration (Task Planner + Agent Coordination Hub) → Expert Agent Suite (Task-oriented, Model-oriented, Data-oriented, Governance)
  - Layer 4 (Application): Disease Diagnosis, Medical Report Generation, Drug Discovery interfaces

- Critical path: Input (e.g., chest X-ray) → Healthcare Application Layer → Agentic Layer (Task Planner decomposes) → Data-oriented Agents (Vector Search retrieves similar cases) → Model-oriented Agents (select/adapt model from Zoo) → Generation → Governance Agents (policy/risk check) → Output → Feedback loop (corrections → Data-oriented Agents → relabel/re-index → semantic tier update)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Retrieval precision vs. coverage: Stricter similarity thresholds improve precision but may return insufficient context for rare findings.
  - Feedback propagation scope: Broad propagation to "similar cases" accelerates improvement but risks contaminating unrelated records.
  - Governance strictness: Conservative policy enforcement ensures compliance but may block legitimate updates; permissive enforcement accelerates adaptation but increases regulatory risk.

- Failure signatures:
  - Generic outputs despite retrieval → Vector Search returning low-similarity matches or embedding space misalignment.
  - Feedback not incorporated → Data feedback loop blocked at Governance Agents or propagation threshold too restrictive.
  - Cross-modal inconsistencies → Semantic enrichment pipeline lagging or embedding models not aligned across modalities.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Measure retrieval quality: Run Vector Search on a held-out test set of chest X-rays with known diagnoses; plot retrieval similarity scores vs. clinical relevance (manual annotation of top-k retrieved cases) to establish baseline precision-recall.
  2. Validate feedback loop: Inject controlled corrections (e.g., flip "pneumonia" to "atelectasis" for specific cases), verify propagation to similar cases, and measure whether re-retrieval returns corrected context for re-queried images.
  3. Stress-test governance: Submit edge-case corrections (e.g., high-uncertainty labels, cross-institutional data) and log where Governance Agents block or delay updates; identify policy thresholds that require tuning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the SAGE-Health data–model co-evolution mechanism sustain measurable performance improvements over extended clinical deployment periods (e.g., 12+ months), and what is the magnitude of improvement compared to static model-centric pipelines?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "current GenAI pipelines in healthcare remain largely unidirectional" and that without adaptive co-evolution, "GenAI performance decays over time, contextual relevance erodes, and clinical adoption stalls."
- Why unresolved: The case study demonstrates a single feedback correction cycle but does not empirically validate whether continuous feedback-driven data enrichment yields compounding improvements over time or quantify decay rates in static systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal deployment studies tracking model performance metrics (e.g., diagnostic accuracy, F1 scores) with and without the feedback loop, measured across multiple time points and clinical sites.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effectively does the two-tier Medical Data Lakehouse architecture handle semantic integration across diverse modalities beyond chest radiography, such as genomic data, longitudinal physiological signals, and unstructured clinical narratives?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that healthcare data spans "structured EHRs, unstructured medical imaging, physiological waveforms, and emerging omics profiles" and that fragmentation causes "semantic, structural, and temporal discontinuities."
- Why unresolved: The case studies focus exclusively on chest X-ray report generation; no empirical evaluation demonstrates semantic alignment or retrieval quality across heterogeneous modalities like genomics or continuous biosignals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-modal retrieval benchmarks measuring semantic alignment accuracy and downstream task performance when integrating at least three diverse modalities (e.g., imaging, EHR text, and ECG signals).

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the trade-off between privacy-preserving mechanisms (differential privacy, federated learning) and model adaptation quality in the SAGE-Health framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes "privacy-preserving computation" and mentions techniques including "differential privacy, zero-knowledge proof, and secure multi-party computation," but does not quantify their impact on model performance.
- Why unresolved: Privacy mechanisms are described conceptually without empirical analysis of how they affect model accuracy, convergence speed, or adaptation fidelity in multi-institutional settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing model adaptation performance (e.g., fine-tuning accuracy, PEFT effectiveness) under varying privacy budgets and federated configurations versus centralized baselines.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the agent-based governance system enforce regulatory compliance across multi-jurisdictional deployments with conflicting requirements (e.g., HIPAA vs. GDPR), and what is the overhead in latency and computational cost?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions compliance with HIPAA and GDPR but does not address how governance agents resolve conflicts between regulatory frameworks or quantify the operational cost of continuous policy enforcement.
- Why unresolved: Multi-jurisdictional compliance is a stated goal, but the architecture does not specify conflict resolution protocols, and no experiments measure governance overhead in realistic clinical workflows.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation or deployment studies across institutions in different regulatory jurisdictions, measuring compliance violation rates, governance decision latency, and computational resource consumption.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends on having sufficiently similar cases in the retrieval archive, limiting performance for rare or novel findings
- Feedback loop stability requires high-quality clinician corrections at sufficient volume; systematic errors could propagate through the loop
- Cross-modal semantic alignment challenges may cause the lakehouse architecture to fail when embedding models poorly capture clinical semantics across modalities

## Confidence
- High confidence: The architectural design principles of SAGE-Health (data-centric foundation, multimodal integration through lakehouse, agentic orchestration) are well-specified and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: The specific implementation details for the feedback loop and continuous data-model co-evolution are described conceptually but lack empirical validation of scale, stability, and error propagation characteristics
- Low confidence: Quantitative performance metrics for the complete system are not provided beyond qualitative comparisons of retrieval-augmented versus baseline outputs

## Next Checks
1. Measure retrieval precision on held-out test set by plotting similarity scores against manually annotated clinical relevance for top-k retrieved cases
2. Validate feedback loop stability by injecting controlled corrections and measuring propagation accuracy over multiple cycles
3. Test cross-modal semantic alignment by measuring retrieval accuracy when modalities differ but clinical context should align
