- This paper introduces minimal supports (MSs) as compact, certified explanations for why a candidate wins under various tournament solutions. An MS is a minimal sub-tournament where the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest is completed. The authors characterize MS structures and sizes for common rules (top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland, Borda, maximin, and weighted uncovered set), providing polynomial-time algorithms to compute smallest MSs (SMSs) for five of the six solutions, with the weighted uncovered set being NP-complete. SMSs enable rigorous, intuitive explanations by highlighting the essential pairwise comparisons that ensure the candidate's victory, making tournament outcomes more transparent and accessible to users.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces minimal supports (MSs) as compact, certified explanations for why a candidate wins under various tournament solutions. An MS is a minimal sub-tournament where the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest is completed. The authors characterize MS structures and sizes for common rules (top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland, Borda, maximin, and weighted uncovered set), providing polynomial-time algorithms to compute smallest MSs (SMSs) for five of the six solutions, with the weighted uncovered set being NP-complete. SMSs enable rigorous, intuitive explanations by highlighting the essential pairwise comparisons that ensure the candidate's victory, making tournament outcomes more transparent and accessible to users.

## Method Summary
The paper defines a Minimal Support (MS) as a minimal sub-tournament guaranteeing a designated candidate's victory under a given tournament solution. For five common rules (Top Cycle, Uncovered Set, Copeland, Borda, Maximin), the authors provide polynomial-time algorithms to compute the Smallest MS (SMS). These algorithms leverage structural properties of each rule: path-based methods for Top Cycle/UC and score-margin analysis for Borda/Copeland/Maximin. The weighted Uncovered Set is shown to be NP-complete. Natural language explanations are generated by translating the graph structures into human-readable statements.

## Key Results
- MSs provide minimal, certified explanations for tournament winners that satisfy Gricean maxims of quality, quantity, and relation
- Polynomial-time algorithms compute SMSs for five common tournament solutions (Top Cycle, Uncovered Set, Copeland, Borda, Maximin)
- The weighted Uncovered Set is NP-complete to find an SMS for
- MSs for Top Cycle are w-rooted out-trees; MSs for score-based rules are determined by score margins
- SMSs can be directly verbalized into natural language explanations without losing essential information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Abductive Subgraph Certification
- **Claim:** A winner's legitimacy in a tournament can be certified by identifying a minimal subgraph (Minimal Support, MS) where the candidate remains the necessary winner regardless of missing edges.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithm prunes the full tournament graph until only the "supporting" edges remain—specifically, those that guarantee victory even in the worst-case completion of the missing edges. This acts as a formal "prime implicant" for the outcome.
- **Core assumption:** The tournament solution is white-box (computable) and monotonicity holds such that removing non-supporting edges does not revert the winner status.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "An MS is a minimal sub-tournament guaranteeing a designated candidate's victory regardless of completion."
  - [section 3.1]: Defines MS as necessary winner $w \in NW_S(G')$ with $\subseteq$-minimality.
  - [corpus]: Related work like *PairJudge RM* suggests tournament structures are increasingly used for LLM evaluation; applying MS could reduce the communication overhead of explaining model rankings.

### Mechanism 2: Structural Decomposition (Trees vs. Neighborhoods)
- **Claim:** Efficient computation of Minimal Supports relies on classifying the tournament solution into "path-based" (e.g., Top Cycle) or "myopic-score" (e.g., Borda) types, which dictate the MS geometry.
- **Mechanism:**
  - **Path-based:** The MS is a rooted out-tree (shortest paths). The algorithm uses Dijkstra-like traversal to find the minimal paths from the winner to all others.
  - **Score-based:** The MS is a neighborhood of score constraints. The algorithm verifies score margins (winner's min score $\geq$ loser's max score) to determine necessary edges.
- **Core assumption:** The tournament solution has specific structural properties (e.g., Top Cycle implies reachability; Borda implies additivity of scores) that allow for localized verification rather than global search.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.1]: "All MSs for TC are w-rooted out-trees."
  - [section 4.4]: Uses "score margin" $\delta(c, G)$ to characterize necessary winners for Borda.
  - [corpus]: *Choices and their Provenance* similarly decomposes argumentation solutions; this suggests a broader trend in structural decomposition for explainability, though the specific tree/neighborhood distinction is unique to this paper.

### Mechanism 3: Polynomial Tractability via Greedy Pruning
- **Claim:** For five of six common rules, the smallest MS (SMS) can be found in polynomial time ($O(m^2)$ or $O(m^2 \log n)$) by greedily satisfying victory constraints.
- **Mechanism:** The algorithms iteratively add edges that contribute most to the winner's score or path-reachability until the "necessary winner" condition is met, then stop. This avoids the exponential search space typical of general abductive explanations.
- **Core assumption:** The specific scoring or reachability function allows for greedy optimization (matroid-like properties) rather than requiring global constraint solving.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [table 1]: Lists "O(m^2)" complexity for Top Cycle, Copeland, etc.
  - [section 4.2]: Notes NP-completeness for the weighted uncovered set is an exception, proving the rule.
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence explains the polynomial bound for these specific rules; this appears to be a novel contribution of the paper.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Tournament Graphs & Dominance**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework relies on representing preferences as directed graphs where an edge $a \to b$ means $a$ beats $b$.
  - **Quick check question:** If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, does $A$ necessarily beat $C$ in a tournament graph? (Note: Not necessarily, tournaments are not always transitive).

- **Concept: Necessary vs. Possible Winners**
  - **Why needed here:** MS is defined via "necessary winners"—candidates who win in *every* possible completion of missing data. You must distinguish this from just winning the observed data.
  - **Quick check question:** If a candidate $w$ has 3 wins and the only other candidate $x$ has a missing comparison against $w$, is $w$ a necessary winner?

- **Concept: Gricean Maxims (Quality, Quantity, Relation, Manner)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly evaluates its explanations against these linguistic principles to ensure they are human-readable and not just mathematical proofs.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a full enumeration of all votes violate the "Quantity" maxim?
