- Introduces a synthetic benchmark for evaluating long-context reasoning in LLMs with tunable cognitive load parameters

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CogniLoad, a synthetic benchmark for evaluating long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), CogniLoad generates natural language logic puzzles with three independently tunable parameters: intrinsic difficulty (d), task length (N), and distractor-to-signal ratio (ρ). These parameters control intrinsic cognitive load (ICL), extraneous cognitive load (ECL), and germane-like processing demands, respectively. Evaluating 22 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals that task length (N) is the dominant performance constraint, with models showing distinct sensitivities to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. Regression analysis identifies "cognitive fingerprints" for each model, providing interpretable capacity thresholds.

## Method Summary
CogniLoad generates synthetic natural language reasoning tasks by controlling three independent parameters: intrinsic difficulty (d), task length (N), and distractor-to-signal ratio (ρ). The benchmark uses templates for different reasoning types (temporal, spatial, numerical, causal, propositional) filled with synthetic entities. Performance is evaluated across a systematic parameter sweep: N ∈ [5,10,15,20], d ∈ [1,3,5,7,10], and ρ ∈ [0.0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0]. The study evaluates 22 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs using few-shot prompts, measuring accuracy to identify model-specific "cognitive fingerprints" through regression analysis.

## Key Results
- Task length (N) is the dominant performance constraint across all evaluated LLMs
- Models exhibit distinct sensitivities to intrinsic complexity (d) and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios (ρ)
- Regression analysis identifies interpretable "cognitive fingerprints" for each model, revealing specific capacity thresholds
- Performance degrades predictably as cognitive load parameters increase, following patterns predicted by Cognitive Load Theory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its grounding in Cognitive Load Theory, which provides a principled framework for decomposing reasoning tasks into controllable cognitive components. By independently varying intrinsic difficulty, task length, and distractor density, CogniLoad isolates specific bottlenecks in LLM reasoning. The synthetic generation ensures reproducibility while maintaining natural language complexity, and the systematic parameter sweep reveals how different models allocate cognitive resources under varying demands.

## Foundational Learning

**Cognitive Load Theory**: Explains how working memory processes information through intrinsic, extraneous, and germane loads. Why needed: Provides theoretical framework for decomposing reasoning tasks into measurable cognitive components. Quick check: Verify that parameter variations align with predicted load effects.

**Synthetic Task Generation**: Automated creation of reasoning problems with controlled complexity. Why needed: Enables systematic parameter sweeps impossible with real-world data. Quick check: Confirm generated tasks maintain natural language coherence across parameter ranges.

**Cognitive Fingerprinting**: Regression-based identification of model-specific performance patterns. Why needed: Enables interpretable diagnosis of model reasoning capabilities beyond aggregate metrics. Quick check: Validate fingerprints are consistent across random task instantiations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Task Generator -> Parameter Controller -> LLM Evaluation -> Performance Analyzer -> Cognitive Fingerprint Extractor

**Critical Path**: The parameter sweep execution and performance measurement pipeline, where varying N, d, and ρ systematically reveals model limitations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Synthetic generation vs. natural data authenticity, parameter granularity vs. computational cost, few-shot vs. fine-tuning evaluation approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Accuracy degradation correlated with parameter thresholds, U-shaped distractor responses indicating optimal vs. detrimental noise levels, model-specific sensitivity patterns revealing architectural bottlenecks.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline accuracy sweep across all parameter combinations
2. Individual parameter ablation to isolate dominant constraints
3. Cross-model comparison of cognitive fingerprints to identify architectural patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic task generation may not fully capture real-world reasoning complexity and semantic richness
- Evaluation focuses on relatively short contexts (N ≤ 20), leaving uncertainty about true long-context behavior
- Static few-shot prompts without exploring adaptive prompting strategies that might mitigate load effects
- Cognitive fingerprint analysis may overfit to this specific task distribution

## Confidence
- High: The benchmark design, parameter tunability, and core empirical findings about N being the dominant factor are well-supported
- Medium: The interpretation of distractor U-curves and model-specific fingerprints requires careful consideration of synthetic task artifacts
- Medium: Claims about generalizability to real-world reasoning are plausible but not directly tested

## Next Checks
1. Test the same models on CogniLoad tasks embedded within much longer contexts (e.g., N=20 within 1000+ token documents) to assess interference from background information
2. Validate findings using a second, independently generated synthetic task corpus with different semantic structures and distractor types to check robustness
3. Evaluate whether instruction-tuned models fine-tuned on similar logic puzzles show altered cognitive fingerprints, indicating task-specific overfitting
