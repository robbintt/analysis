# Enabling Group Fairness in Graph Unlearning via Bi-level Debiasing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.09702
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09702
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining comparable accuracy and privacy to standard graph unlearning methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness concerns in graph unlearning, a privacy-preserving technique for removing user data from graph models. The authors observe that existing graph unlearning methods introduce bias when deleting user information, with exact methods showing more bias than approximate ones. To address this, they propose FGU (Fairness-Aware Graph Unlearning), which employs a bi-level debiasing approach: shard-level fairness through fairness regularizers during retraining, and global-level fairness through alignment of shard models. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness (lower ∆DP and ∆EO values) while maintaining comparable accuracy and privacy to standard graph unlearning methods. The method shows robustness across various unlearning ratios and data distributions, making it the first framework to simultaneously preserve privacy and ensure fairness in graph unlearning.

## Method Summary
The proposed FGU framework introduces a bi-level debiasing approach to address fairness concerns in graph unlearning. At the shard level, FGU applies fairness regularizers during the retraining process of each shard to promote equitable treatment across different groups. At the global level, it employs model alignment techniques to ensure consistency and fairness across all shards. The framework operates by first partitioning the graph into shards, then applying fairness-aware retraining when data removal requests occur. This approach effectively mitigates the bias introduced by traditional graph unlearning methods while preserving the privacy guarantees. The method is designed to be compatible with both exact and approximate graph unlearning techniques, though the experiments show it performs particularly well with approximate methods.

## Key Results
- FGU achieves significantly lower ∆DP and ∆EO values compared to standard graph unlearning methods, demonstrating superior fairness performance
- The framework maintains comparable accuracy and privacy guarantees to baseline methods while improving fairness metrics
- FGU shows robustness across various unlearning ratios and data distributions, with consistent performance improvements on all six evaluated datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FGU works by addressing bias at two complementary levels. The shard-level debiasing introduces fairness regularizers during the retraining process, which directly influences how the model adapts when data is removed. These regularizers ensure that the loss function accounts for fairness constraints, preventing the model from developing biased representations during the unlearning process. The global-level debiasing then aligns the shard models to maintain consistency in their fairness behavior, preventing discrepancies that could arise from different retraining processes. This bi-level approach ensures that fairness is preserved both locally (within each shard) and globally (across the entire model), creating a comprehensive solution to the bias problem in graph unlearning.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Graph Data -> Sharding Module -> Shard-level Retraining (with Fairness Regularizers) -> Global Alignment Module -> Fair Unlearned Model

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from the initial graph data through the sharding process, followed by fairness-aware retraining of each shard, and culminates in the global alignment step. The shard-level retraining is the most computationally intensive component, while the global alignment is relatively lightweight but crucial for maintaining consistency.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades some computational overhead for improved fairness guarantees. The shard-level regularizers increase retraining time but are essential for preventing bias accumulation. The global alignment step adds minimal overhead but significantly improves fairness consistency across shards.

**Failure Signatures:**
If fairness metrics do not improve, potential causes include: insufficient regularization strength, improper shard partitioning that creates imbalanced groups, or inadequate alignment between shard models. Accuracy drops beyond acceptable levels might indicate overly aggressive fairness constraints.

**First Experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison: Run standard graph unlearning (both exact and approximate) on a small dataset to establish fairness baseline
2. Ablation study: Test FGU with only shard-level debiasing, then only global-level debiasing, to isolate their individual effects
3. Scalability test: Apply FGU to progressively larger datasets to assess computational overhead and performance scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study primarily focuses on node classification tasks, with limited discussion of how FGU extends to other graph-based applications like link prediction or recommendation systems
- The computational overhead of the bi-level debiasing approach is not thoroughly analyzed, particularly for large-scale graphs where shard-level retraining could become prohibitive
- While the paper demonstrates effectiveness across six datasets, the diversity of these datasets in terms of graph characteristics and real-world applicability could be further explored

## Confidence
**High:** The observation that exact graph unlearning methods introduce more bias than approximate methods is well-supported by comparative analysis
**Medium:** The major claims about FGU's effectiveness in simultaneously preserving privacy and ensuring fairness are supported by experimental results, though limited by scope of evaluation metrics and potential scalability concerns
**Low:** Theoretical guarantees for fairness preservation during the unlearning process could be strengthened

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FGU's performance and scalability on larger, real-world graph datasets with millions of nodes and edges to assess practical applicability
2. Extend the framework to other graph learning tasks beyond node classification, such as link prediction and graph classification
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of shard-level and global-level fairness mechanisms to the overall performance
