# Quantum Qualifiers for Neural Network Model Selection in Hadronic Physics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.13463
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13463
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Primary result:** Introduces "quantum qualifier" diagnostic tool based on complexity and information-theoretic measures to predict when quantum deep neural networks outperform classical ones in hadronic physics problems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for determining when quantum deep neural networks (QDNNs) offer advantages over classical deep neural networks (CDNNs) in hadronic physics problems. The authors introduce a "quantum qualifier" - a diagnostic tool based on complexity and information-theoretic measures (nonlinearity, frequency complexity, fractal dimension, mutual information, and Fourier transform complexity) - that predicts whether a given data-driven extraction task is better suited for CDNNs or QDNNs.

The methodology is tested through controlled classification and regression studies, showing that QDNN performance depends systematically on data complexity, noise levels, and dimensionality. A key finding is that increasing noise systematically expands the domain where QDNNs outperform CDNNs. The framework is then applied to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data from Jefferson Lab, where the quantum qualifier successfully identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a quantum qualifier framework that uses complexity and information-theoretic measures to predict when QDNNs will outperform CDNNs. The methodology involves calculating five metrics - nonlinearity, frequency complexity, fractal dimension, mutual information, and Fourier transform complexity - from input data distributions. These metrics are combined through weighted sums to create a single qualifier score that determines model selection. The framework is validated through synthetic datasets with controlled complexity and noise levels, followed by application to DVCS Compton form factor extraction. The approach systematically examines how quantum advantage varies with data complexity, dimensionality, and noise levels.

## Key Results
- Quantum qualifier successfully predicts CDNN vs QDNN performance with sign agreement scores of 0.84-0.90 across different noise levels
- Increasing noise systematically expands the domain where QDNNs outperform CDNNs
- Framework identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models in DVCS Compton form factor extraction
- Qualifier reproduces large-scale structure of observed quantum outperformance across experimental kinematic domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The quantum qualifier works by capturing fundamental differences between quantum and classical information processing through multiple complementary complexity measures. Quantum circuits can naturally represent and process high-dimensional, non-linear relationships that are computationally expensive for classical networks. The combination of nonlinearity, frequency complexity, fractal dimension, mutual information, and Fourier transform complexity provides a multi-faceted view of data structure that correlates with quantum advantage. When data exhibits high complexity across these measures, quantum circuits can leverage quantum parallelism and interference to process information more efficiently than classical counterparts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Nonlinearity measures**: Quantify how data deviates from linear relationships; needed to identify quantum circuits' natural advantage in handling complex, non-linear patterns; quick check: compute correlation dimension of data manifold
- **Frequency complexity**: Captures spectral properties of data distributions; needed because quantum circuits can efficiently represent certain frequency domains; quick check: perform Fourier analysis on data samples
- **Fractal dimension**: Measures geometric complexity of data structures; needed to identify multi-scale patterns where quantum advantage may emerge; quick check: calculate box-counting dimension on data projections
- **Mutual information**: Quantifies statistical dependencies between variables; needed to identify correlated structures that quantum circuits can process efficiently; quick check: compute pairwise mutual information matrix
- **Fourier transform complexity**: Assesses how data energy is distributed across frequency components; needed because quantum advantage often relates to frequency domain processing; quick check: compute spectral entropy of data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Data -> Complexity Measures (5 metrics) -> Weighted Sum -> Quantum Qualifier Score -> Model Selection Decision (CDNN vs QDNN)

**Critical Path:** The essential computation flow is: calculate five complexity measures → apply learned weights → compute qualifier score → compare against threshold → select appropriate model architecture

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances comprehensiveness (using five metrics) against computational efficiency. Using more metrics increases predictive power but also computational cost and potential overfitting. The weighting scheme requires calibration but provides flexibility. The choice of complexity measures reflects physical intuition about quantum advantage rather than exhaustive theoretical derivation.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance occurs when the qualifier misclassifies regimes where quantum advantage is marginal or when noise levels significantly deviate from training conditions. The framework may fail for data types that don't align with the assumptions underlying the complexity measures. Systematic biases can emerge when the weighting scheme is poorly calibrated for specific data distributions.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test qualifier on synthetic data with known ground truth quantum advantage across varying complexity levels
2. Validate noise response by systematically increasing noise and observing qualifier predictions
3. Apply qualifier to a simple physical system (e.g., harmonic oscillator) before scaling to complex hadronic problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quantum qualifier's effectiveness demonstrated primarily through controlled synthetic datasets and single physical application (DVCS Compton form factors)
- Framework assumes chosen complexity measures adequately capture quantum-classical differences, though theoretical justification remains partially heuristic
- Focuses on shallow quantum circuits, potentially limiting generalizability to more complex quantum architectures

## Confidence
- **Major claims validation**: Medium
  - Theoretical foundation and empirical validation provide reasonable support
  - Limited scope of applications and heuristic methodological choices prevent higher confidence
  - Predictive power shows room for improvement in capturing edge cases and boundary conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test quantum qualifier across diverse physical domains beyond hadronic physics to assess generalizability
2. Validate framework with more complex quantum circuit architectures, including deeper circuits and different quantum gate sets
3. Conduct systematic studies varying noise distributions and correlation structures to better understand noise-advantage relationship and refine qualifier's predictive capabilities
