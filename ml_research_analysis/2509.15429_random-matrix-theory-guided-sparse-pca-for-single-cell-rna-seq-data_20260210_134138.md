## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-guided sparse PCA method for denoising single-cell RNA-seq data. The key innovation is a novel biwhitening algorithm inspired by Sinkhorn-Knopp proportional scaling that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells, enabling RMT-based automatic selection of the sparsity level for sparse PCA. Applied across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, the method achieved up to 30% noise reduction compared to standard PCA and consistently outperformed PCA, autoencoder (scVI, DCA), and diffusion-based (MAGIC) methods in cell-type classification tasks. The RMT-guided sparse PCA performed on par with PCA using 10x more cells, demonstrating significant dimensionality reduction while preserving biological signal.

## Method Summary
The method combines biwhitening (using a Sinkhorn-Knopp-inspired algorithm) with RMT-based sparse PCA to denoise scRNA-seq data. First, biwhitening simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells by estimating diagonal scaling matrices C and D. This transforms the data to match the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, where signal and noise eigenvalues are separable. The spectral edge λ₊ = (1 + √q)² defines the threshold between noise and signal. The sparsity parameter γ for sparse PCA is then selected using an RMT criterion that predicts the overlap between outlier and signal eigenspaces. This makes sparse PCA "nearly parameter-free." The method achieves superior cell-type classification accuracy while reducing dimensionality compared to standard PCA, autoencoders, and diffusion-based methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 30% noise reduction compared to standard PCA across seven scRNA-seq technologies
- Consistently outperformed PCA, autoencoders (scVI, DCA), and diffusion-based (MAGIC) methods in cell-type classification
- RMT-guided sparse PCA performed on par with PCA using 10x more cells
- Empirical optimal sparsity parameter is γ ≈ 0.6γ*, where γ* is the RMT-predicted threshold
- Best results obtained with FISTA algorithm using Löwdin orthogonalization after each iteration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Biwhitening Stabilizes Variance
Biwhitening stabilizes variance across both cells and genes, transforming the data to match the Marchenko-Pastur distribution where signal and noise eigenvalues are separable. The Sinkhorn-Knopp-inspired algorithm iteratively scales rows (cells) and columns (genes) so that their marginal variances converge to unity. This produces diagonal matrices C and D such that C⁻² ≃ A (cell-cell covariance) and D⁻² ≃ B (gene-gene covariance), transforming data via X ← A⁻¹⁄²XB⁻¹⁄². After biwhitening, the eigenspectrum follows the analytically known Marchenko-Pastur distribution with spectral edge λ₊ = (1 + √q)², where q = p/n. Core assumption: The data follows a separable covariance structure where E[(Xij - E[Xij])(Xkl - E[Xkl])] = AikBjl. Assumption: Fourth moments of entries are bounded, and spectral distributions converge to compactly supported probability distributions.

### Mechanism 2: RMT Provides Principled Sparsity Selection
RMT provides a unique mapping between outlier eigenvalues λ (above spectral edge) and signal eigenvalues α via α = -1/m(λ), enabling principled sparsity parameter selection. For biwhitened data, each outlier eigenvector has predicted squared overlap with the signal subspace: ∥Qv∥²₂ = (α-1)² - q / [(α-1)(α-1 + q)]. The sparsity parameter γ is selected so that tr(QueriedSpace × OutlierSpace) matches this RMT-predicted overlap. This renders sparse PCA "nearly parameter-free." Core assumption: When A = I (achieved via biwhitening), there exists a unique mapping between signal and outlier eigenspaces irrespective of whether signal lies in P (mean), B (covariance), or both.

### Mechanism 3: Sparse PCA on Biwhitened Data Denoises Effectively
Sparse PCA on biwhitened data denoises eigenvectors more effectively than standard PCA, autoencoders, or diffusion methods for cell-type classification. Standard PCA eigenvectors remain uncorrected under RMT rotationally-invariant estimators. Sparse PCA directly denoises leading eigenvectors by enforcing sparsity on loading vectors. Combined with biwhitening's noise-signal separation, this preserves biological signal while reducing noise by ~30%. Core assumption: The separable covariance model accurately captures single-cell RNA-seq data structure. Assumption: Sparsity on loading vectors (not regression weights) is the correct inductive bias—AManPG with pure L1 regularization underperforms.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Marchenko-Pastur Distribution**
  - Why needed here: This is the theoretical foundation—the "bulk" eigenvalue distribution for random matrices that defines where noise ends and signal begins. Without this, you cannot identify outlier eigenvalues or compute the spectral edge λ₊.
  - Quick check question: Given q = p/n = 0.67, can you compute the spectral edge λ₊ = (1 + √q)² and explain why eigenvalues above this threshold are considered signal?

- **Concept: Sparse PCA vs. Standard PCA**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is guiding sparse PCA with RMT. You must understand that sparse PCA adds L1 penalties to loading vectors (forcing many weights to zero) but that different formulations (max-variance, regression-based, dictionary-learning) solve non-equivalent problems when penalized.
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper find that AManPG with pure L1 regularization underperforms compared to elastic-net with large L2 penalty? What does this suggest about regression-weight sparsity vs. loading-vector sparsity?

- **Concept: Separable Covariance Structure**
  - Why needed here: The entire theoretical framework assumes E[(Xij)(Xkl)] = AikBjl—cell correlations and gene correlations factorize. This justifies both the biwhitening approach and the RMT mapping.
  - Quick check question: If the separable covariance assumption were violated (e.g., gene-gene correlations varied substantially across cell types), which component of the pipeline would fail first—the biwhitening convergence or the RMT sparsity criterion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Raw counts → Library-size normalization → Log(x+1) transform → [Biwhitening: Sinkhorn-Knopp iteration estimating C, D] → X_biwhitened = C × X × D → [Identify outliers: eigenvalues > λ₊ = (1 + √q)²] → [RMT criterion: compute γ* from predicted overlaps] → [Sparse PCA: apply sklearn/GPower/AManPG/FISTA with γ ≈ 0.6γ*] → Denoised principal components → k-NN classification

- **Critical path:** The biwhitening algorithm (Alg. 1) is the single point of failure. If C and D estimates are poor, the Marchenko-Pastur fit fails (high KS distance), outlier identification fails, and the RMT criterion becomes meaningless. Monitor KS distance and p-values as health metrics.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Biwhitening stage flexibility: Can operate on raw counts, library-size corrected, or log-normalized data. Paper shows similar performance to BiPCA on counts, but log-normalization + biwhitening works best for sparse PCA.
  - Sparse PCA algorithm choice: FISTA with Löwdin orthogonalization (naive implementation) surprisingly outperforms established methods. sklearn and AManPG (with large L2 penalty) are reliable alternatives.
  - Scale factor: γ ≈ 0.6γ* empirically optimal—over-penalization destroys signal, under-penalization leaves noise.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High KS distance after biwhitening (>0.02): indicates separable covariance assumption violated or preprocessing mismatch.
  - All eigenvalues below λ₊: no outliers detected; either truly no signal or biwhitening over-whitened.
  - Classification accuracy drops below PCA baseline: likely γ > γ* (over-sparsification) or biwhitening applied incorrectly (e.g., gene-wise z-score only).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce biwhitening + KS validation: On Zheng2017 dataset, implement Alg. 1 and verify KS distance < 0.02. Plot eigenspectrum vs. Marchenko-Pastur distribution. Confirm outlier eigenvalues exist above λ₊.
  2. Ablate biwhitening vs. gene-wise z-score: Run sparse PCA pipeline with biwhitening vs. standard gene-wise z-scoring. Measure noise reduction (Eq. 9) and classification accuracy. Expect dramatic drop without biwhitening.
  3. Sweep γ/γ* ratio: For sklearn sparse PCA, sweep γ from 0.2γ* to 1.5γ* on Luecken2021. Plot noise reduction vs. γ/γ*. Verify sharp performance cliff above γ* and plateau near 0.6γ*.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can a more robust estimator for the support of the limiting spectral density (ρS) be developed to enable direct correction of gene expression at the count level?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that the main limitation is the lack of a better estimator for the support of ρS, forcing them to operate on biwhitened data where the support is analytically known (Marchenko-Pastur).
  - Why unresolved: Current empirical estimators derived from biwhitening factors fail to reconstruct the support of ρS, making it impossible to identify the outlier eigenspace on raw or left-whitened counts.
  - What evidence would resolve it: The derivation and validation of an estimator that accurately identifies the spectral support on left-whitened data, allowing the method to function without biwhitening and enabling exact count recovery.

- Can the RMT-guided sparse PCA approach be effectively adapted for tasks beyond unsupervised cell-type classification, such as differential expression or trajectory inference?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that in its current form, the method is tailored specifically to cell-type classification, whereas generative models like autoencoders can address broader tasks like direct denoising of counts.
  - Why unresolved: The current methodology focuses on reconstructing the principal subspace (eigenspace) rather than reconstructing the full count matrix, which is required for many downstream analyses beyond clustering.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks demonstrating that sparse PCs derived from this method improve the accuracy of differential expression testing or pseudotime ordering compared to standard PCA or count-based denoising.

- How robust is the biwhitening algorithm to violations of the separable covariance structure assumption in heterogeneous tissues?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The method relies on the assumption of a separable covariance structure (E[...] = AikBjl), implying gene-gene correlations do not vary across cells.
  - Why unresolved: Biological tissues often contain distinct cell types with different covariance structures. The paper does not analyze performance when this separability assumption is violated or when "signal" varies non-separably.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Simulation studies or analyses of complex tissues where covariance structures differ significantly between cell populations, showing whether biwhitening introduces artifacts or fails to converge.

## Limitations

- The fundamental assumption that cell-cell and gene-gene correlations factorize (E[(Xij)(Xkl)] = AikBjl) is not rigorously validated on real scRNA-seq data.
- The method shows best results on log-normalized data, but theoretical framework behavior on raw counts or other normalization schemes remains uncharacterized.
- Computational scalability concerns for very large datasets (millions of cells, tens of thousands of genes) due to iterative matrix operations.

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Biwhitening stabilizes variance and enables RMT noise-signal separation (supported by KS distance metrics and Marchenko-Pastur fit validation)
- RMT provides principled sparsity parameter selection (supported by empirical finding that γ ≈ 0.6γ* works consistently)
- Sparse PCA on biwhitened data outperforms PCA, autoencoders, and diffusion methods (supported by classification accuracy improvements)

**Medium Confidence:**
- The separable covariance assumption accurately captures scRNA-seq data structure (empirically validated but not formally tested)
- The specific scaling factor γ ≈ 0.6γ* is universally optimal (empirically observed but lacks theoretical justification)

**Low Confidence:**
- Performance comparison to foundation models and manifold learning approaches beyond the specific methods tested

## Next Checks

1. **Test Separable Covariance Assumption:** Apply the method to synthetic data with known covariance structures where the separable assumption is violated. Measure performance degradation to quantify the assumption's importance.

2. **Validate Across Normalization Schemes:** Reproduce the full pipeline (biwhitening + sparse PCA) on the same datasets using raw counts, library-size normalized data, and log-normalized data. Compare RMT fit quality (KS distance), sparsity parameter selection, and downstream classification performance.

3. **Benchmark Against Foundation Models:** Compare RMT-guided sparse PCA performance to emerging foundation models (like those mentioned in corpus papers) on the same datasets, focusing on both interpretability and classification accuracy.
