# Large Language Model Agents Are Not Always Faithful Self-Evolvers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22436
- Reference count: 40
- Agents depend on raw experience but often disregard condensed experience, even when it's the only form provided.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates experience faithfulness—the causal dependence of self-evolving LLM agents on their accumulated experience. Through controlled causal interventions across multiple frameworks, backbones, and environments, the authors reveal a striking asymmetry: agents consistently rely on raw experiences but often disregard or misinterpret condensed ones. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent settings and model scales, challenging assumptions about self-evolving methods and highlighting the need for more faithful experience integration.

## Method Summary
The study employs causal interventions to evaluate experience faithfulness in self-evolving LLM agents. Four agent frameworks (ExpeL, Dynamic Cheatsheet, ReasoningBank, G-Memory) are tested across ten LLM backbones and nine benchmarks. Interventions include Empty, Shuffle, Irrelevant for raw experience and Empty, Corrupt, Irrelevant, Filler for condensed experience. The method measures performance changes under these perturbations to assess whether agents causally depend on different experience types. Vector retrieval (k=2-6) with Faiss is used for memory access, and experiments are conducted on A800 GPUs using vLLM.

## Key Results
- Agents show large performance drops when raw experience is perturbed but minimal changes when condensed experience is corrupted, replaced, or filled with placeholders.
- Integrated Gradients analysis reveals low attribution scores for condensed experience segments, indicating underutilization due to local-context bias.
- Knowledge-intensive tasks show reduced faithfulness to all experience types due to reliance on pretrained priors.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Self-evolving LLM agents exhibit a strong causal dependence on raw experience (E_raw) but not on condensed experience (E_cond), creating a faithfulness gap.
- **Mechanism:** Causal interventions cause large performance drops when applied to E_raw but negligible changes when applied to E_cond, indicating E_cond is not causally grounded in agent behavior.
- **Core Assumption:** Behavioral changes under controlled input perturbations signal true utilization of that input.
- **Evidence Anchors:**
  - [abstract] "agents consistently depend on raw experiences but often disregard or misinterpret condensed ones"
  - [section 4.1] "Raw experience is faithfully exploited, whereas condensed experience is not... perturbing raw experience causes pronounced degradation, confirming that agents rely on the semantic and temporal structure... replacing condensed experience with Corrupt, Irrelevant, or Filler yields only minimal changes."
- **Break Condition:** If future architectures demonstrate equivalent behavioral sensitivity to both E_raw and E_cond interventions under the same conditions, this mechanism would be invalidated.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Condensed experiences are semantically underutilized due to internal model processing biases that prioritize local context.
- **Mechanism:** Integrated Gradients (IG) analysis reveals that E_cond segments receive low attribution scores across all layers, while the current trajectory (local context) dominates in later layers.
- **Core Assumption:** Token-level attribution scores reflect functional importance in model computations.
- **Evidence Anchors:**
  - [abstract] "internal processing biases that suppress experience"
  - [section 5.2] "Condensed experience remains underutilized... Current trajectory dominates later layers... strong local-context bias in prediction"
- **Break Condition:** If novel condensation formats or architectural modifications can reverse this attribution pattern (yielding high E_cond IG scores), the processing bias explanation would be weakened.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Task domains with strong pre-trained priors (e.g., knowledge-intensive QA) reduce experience grounding.
- **Mechanism:** In tasks where the backbone model already possesses sufficient internal knowledge, retrieved experiences have low marginal utility and are often ignored, leading to lower faithfulness even for E_raw.
- **Core Assumption:** Models rely on a mix of internal priors and external context; when priors suffice, external inputs are de-weighted.
- **Evidence Anchors:**
  - [abstract] "task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice"
  - [section 5.3] "when a task can be handled with the agent's innate knowledge, the retrieved experience contributes little and thus fails to exert meaningful causal influence"
- **Break Condition:** If novel tasks with no pretraining coverage show high faithfulness to both E_raw and E_cond, this mechanism would gain support.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Causal Intervention as a Faithfulness Test**
  - **Why Needed Here:** To move beyond performance correlation and assess whether the model causally depends on an input (i.e., behavior changes when input is altered).
  - **Quick Check Question:** Does altering the input change the output? If not, the model is unfaithful to that input.

- **Concept: Experience Types (Raw vs. Condensed)**
  - **Why Needed Here:** Different experience forms (concrete trajectories vs. abstract heuristics) trigger different utilization patterns; the paper argues raw is faithfully used, condensed is not.
  - **Quick Check Question:** Can you distinguish a specific trajectory from a general heuristic in your agent's memory?

- **Concept: Attribution Analysis (Integrated Gradients)**
  - **Why Needed Here:** To understand *why* faithfulness fails—low attribution indicates the model isn't integrating the input; high attribution indicates it is.
  - **Quick Check Question:** Which token segments does your model "attend to" during final predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component Map:**
  Memory System (M) → stores {E_raw, E_cond} → Retrieval Module → selects M(x) ⊂ M for current task x → Agent π_θ → augmented with [x; M(x)] → produces output y → (Evaluation) Intervention Layer → applies Empty/Shuffle/Irrelevant/Corrupt/Filler to M(x) → observes Δy as faithfulness metric

- **Critical Path:**
  1. Experience collection (trajectory τ, reward r) → store in M.
  2. Task inference → retrieve M(x) → augment prompt → model generates y.
  3. (Evaluation) Intervene on M(x) → observe Δy as faithfulness metric.

- **Design Tradeoffs:**
  - Condensed memory (compact, transferable) vs. Raw memory (faithfully used, but larger).
  - Simple retrieval (e.g., cosine similarity) may miss semantic grounding needed for E_cond.
  - Parameter-free adaptation (frozen LLM) vs. potential fine-tuning for better experience integration.

- **Failure Signatures:**
  - Agent performance is unchanged when E_cond is corrupted, replaced with irrelevant text, or even filled with placeholder tokens (e.g., "###").
  - IG scores show low attribution to E_cond segments, high attribution to current trajectory.
  - Knowledge-intensive tasks show low sensitivity to all experience interventions.

- **First 3 Experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Faithfulness Test:** Implement intervention suite (Empty, Shuffle, Irrelevant for E_raw; Empty, Corrupt, Irrelevant, Filler for E_cond) on your agent; measure performance drops. Expect large Δ for E_raw, minimal Δ for E_cond.
  2. **Condensed-Only Ablation:** Provide only E_cond (no E_raw) to isolate its influence. If performance remains insensitive to semantic perturbations, unfaithfulness is not due to E_raw overshadowing.
  3. **Task Domain Sweep:** Evaluate faithfulness across a spectrum from knowledge-light (ALFWorld, WebShop) to knowledge-heavy (HotpotQA, MMLU-Pro) tasks. Expect faithfulness to decline as task domain knowledge in the backbone increases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can automatic condensation methods be designed to optimize for behavioral utility and alignment rather than surface brevity, and would such methods improve faithful utilization of condensed experience?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Impact Statement states "This opens up promising directions for automatic condensation methods that optimize for alignment and usability, rather than surface brevity alone."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies semantic limitations of condensed content as a cause of unfaithfulness but does not propose or test alternative condensation approaches.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study measuring faithfulness via causal interventions when agents use standard condensation vs. utility-optimized condensation methods.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can dynamic, situationally-aware retrieval and injection of experience (based on task demands, interaction history, and model uncertainty) improve faithfulness compared to static prepending?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Impact Statement suggests "experience should be retrieved and injected dynamically, based on task demands, interaction history, and internal model uncertainty" and that "Incorporating experience as a situationally-aware, interactively-triggered signal holds promise."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates unfaithfulness under static integration but does not explore alternative retrieval timing or injection strategies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing faithfulness under static prepending versus dynamic retrieval triggered by uncertainty or task state.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can internal processing biases that suppress condensed experience utilization be mitigated through architectural modifications or targeted fine-tuning?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper identifies "internal processing biases that suppress experience" as a cause of unfaithfulness, and IG analysis shows "condensed experience remains underutilized" due to "structural biases in the model's attention flow."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper diagnoses this bias via attribution analysis but does not evaluate interventions to address it.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Studies testing whether attention modifications, fine-tuning on experience-utilization tasks, or prompting strategies increase IG attribution for condensed experience and improve faithfulness.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How would fine-tuning or parameter updates (rather than frozen backbones) affect the faithfulness gap between raw and condensed experience utilization?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper explicitly notes "the LLM backbone remains frozen, and behavioral adaptation arises solely from...external experiences" but does not explore whether parameter updates could improve faithfulness.
- **Why unresolved:** The entire study is constrained to frozen backbones; whether training agents to better utilize condensed experience would close the gap remains unknown.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing frozen versus fine-tuned agents on faithfulness metrics, with training objectives rewarding faithful experience utilization.

## Limitations

- **Intervention validity uncertainty**: The semantic fidelity of corruption/irrelevance methods is not validated, potentially confounding results about whether models truly ignore content or respond to perturbation artifacts.
- **Attribution interpretation limits**: Integrated Gradients scores are treated as direct measures of causal utilization, but attribution methods can be sensitive to baseline choice and tokenization, making the link between IG scores and actual decision-making influence inferential rather than proven.
- **Task coverage constraints**: While nine benchmarks span multiple domains, the sample may not capture all task regimes where condensed experiences could be effective, and the claim about pretrained priors universally reducing experience grounding needs broader empirical support.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The raw vs. condensed asymmetry under interventions is robust across frameworks and scales. The empirical observation that raw experience perturbations cause performance drops while condensed ones do not is directly measurable and consistently observed.
- **Medium Confidence**: The attribution-based explanation for condensed experience underutilization is plausible but not definitively proven. IG scores show patterns consistent with the claim, but alternative explanations (e.g., retrieval quality, prompt structure) are not fully ruled out.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalization of task-domain effects to all knowledge-intensive domains. While the trend is observed, the specific threshold where pretrained priors dominate varies by model and task complexity, and the paper doesn't systematically map this boundary.

## Next Checks

1. **Intervention fidelity test**: Apply the same perturbation suite to human-written summaries vs. raw transcripts in a controlled reading comprehension task. If humans show similar insensitivity to corrupted summaries, it would validate that the perturbation method preserves the core semantic gap.

2. **Attribution ablation study**: Modify the model architecture to force attention to condensed segments (e.g., via attention bias or explicit weighting) and measure if IG scores and faithfulness change correspondingly. This would test whether low attribution is causal or correlational.

3. **Cross-task pretraining analysis**: Train models from scratch on a subset of tasks and compare faithfulness to pretrained models on the same tasks. If faithfulness increases for knowledge-intensive tasks without pretraining, it would confirm the prior-dependence mechanism.
