# Conformal Safety Monitoring for Flight Testing: A Case Study in Data-Driven Safety Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20811
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20811
- Reference count: 24
- Key outcome: Data-driven runtime safety monitoring using conformal prediction achieves miss rate bounds while providing preemptive alerts in flight testing with uncertain dynamics

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a conformal prediction framework for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, addressing the challenge of ensuring safety when aircraft dynamics are uncertain and traditional constraint specification is difficult. The method uses offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of short-term safety risk, enabling pilots to receive preemptive alerts before safety violations occur. The approach is evaluated on a lateral-directional flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating reliable identification of unsafe scenarios while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

The conformal safety monitor provides interpretable p-values as continuous safety scores, allowing pilots to make informed decisions about aborting maneuvers. By learning from simulated trajectories rather than relying on handcrafted safety specifications, the method adapts to complex, uncertain dynamics while providing statistical guarantees on miss rates. The approach consists of three components: a predictive model for future states, a nearest neighbor classifier for safety determination, and conformal calibration to ensure statistical validity.

## Method Summary
The method employs a three-component architecture for runtime safety monitoring. First, a linear predictor φ is trained via least squares on safe trajectory data to forecast future states from recent observations. Second, a nearest neighbor classifier determines safety by comparing predicted states to distributions of safe and unsafe observations. Third, conformal prediction calibrates thresholds to provide statistical guarantees on miss rates. The approach learns from offline stochastic trajectory simulations, collecting both safe and unsafe observations to build predictive models and calibration sets.

The conformal score combines distances to nearest safe and unsafe examples, with thresholds calibrated using intra-dataset leave-one-out distances. This enables the monitor to provide preemptive alerts t_early = 0.25 seconds before potential safety violations while maintaining miss rate bounds. The method is evaluated on an LTI flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating reliable performance across multiple risk levels.

## Key Results
- Conformal safety monitor achieves miss rate ≤ ε across ε ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.15, ..., 0.3} on flight dynamics model
- Outperforms baseline approaches in preemptive risk classification for lateral-directional maneuvers
- Provides interpretable p-values as continuous safety scores for pilot decision-making
- Maintains high classification power (low false alarms) while ensuring statistical guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging conformal prediction's ability to provide distribution-free statistical guarantees while adapting to complex, uncertain dynamics through data-driven learning. The predictive model forecasts short-term future states from recent observations, enabling preemptive alerts before violations occur. The nearest neighbor classifier effectively separates safe from unsafe regions in the learned feature space, while conformal calibration ensures that theoretical miss rate bounds hold empirically. This combination allows the monitor to handle the interaction between uncertain aircraft dynamics and human pilot decisions without requiring explicit safety constraint specification.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction**: Provides distribution-free statistical guarantees on classification error rates; needed to ensure miss rate bounds hold without distributional assumptions; quick check: verify calibration set is exchangeable with test data
- **Stochastic Trajectory Simulation**: Generates diverse scenarios covering both safe and unsafe regions; needed to build representative training and calibration sets; quick check: ensure parameter distribution covers realistic operating conditions
- **Nearest Neighbor Classification**: Enables flexible decision boundaries based on empirical distributions; needed for effective separation of safe/unsafe regions in learned feature space; quick check: verify k-NN distances meaningfully separate classes
- **Predictive State Modeling**: Forecasts future states from recent observations; needed for preemptive alerts before safety violations; quick check: validate prediction accuracy on held-out trajectories
- **Leave-one-out Calibration**: Ensures calibration scores are independent of test examples; needed for valid conformal guarantees; quick check: verify intra-dataset distances use proper leave-one-out procedure

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Flight Dynamics -> Observation Buffer -> Linear Predictor -> Conformal Score -> Safety Alert

**Critical Path**: The sequence from observation buffer through linear predictor to conformal score computation forms the critical path, as prediction accuracy directly impacts classification performance and calibration validity.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The linear predictor offers computational efficiency but may miss non-linear dynamics; nearest neighbor classification provides flexibility but scales poorly with data size; conformal calibration ensures guarantees but requires sufficient calibration data.

**Failure Signatures**: High false alarm rates indicate poor predictor generalization or insufficient separation in feature space; violated miss rate bounds suggest exchangeability violations or calibration issues; delayed alerts indicate prediction horizon mismatch with system dynamics.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify linear predictor φ achieves reasonable prediction accuracy on held-out safe trajectories
2. Test nearest neighbor distances effectively separate Y_u from Y_s in transformed feature space
3. Confirm conformal calibration achieves desired miss rate bounds on validation trajectories

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: How can stochastic and reactive human pilot models be integrated into the prediction step to accurately forecast pilot reactions, and how does this interaction affect the conformal miss rate guarantees?
- **Open Question 2**: Can the nearest-neighbor based monitor retain statistical guarantees and classification power when applied to abstract safety specifications (e.g., structural loads or gain/phase margins) where handcrafted conformal scores are infeasible?
- **Open Question 3**: Does replacing the linear predictive model with probabilistic or online-adaptive models improve classification power or enable tighter alert thresholds without violating the conformal guarantee?

## Limitations
- Flight dynamics matrices and controller parameters are unspecified, limiting exact reproduction
- Method assumes parameter distributions remain stable between training and test phases
- Nearest neighbor approach may not scale well to high-dimensional feature spaces or abstract safety specifications

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Theoretical validity of conformal prediction framework and miss rate bounds
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical miss rate results and classification power metrics due to unspecified simulation parameters
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that conformal safety monitoring outperforms baseline approaches without full baseline specifications

## Next Checks
1. Verify that the linear predictor φ trained only on safe trajectories generalizes to predict future states for unseen parameter variations, checking prediction error distributions
2. Confirm that the conformal score computation using nearest neighbor distances maintains exchangeability between calibration and test sets when parameters are drawn from the same distribution
3. Test the sensitivity of miss rate bounds to the observation buffer size k and prediction horizon t_early, varying these parameters systematically to assess robustness
