- Introduces first benchmark for confidence estimation in multi-turn medical consultations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in medical AI safety by introducing the first benchmark for evaluating confidence estimation in multi-turn medical consultations. Unlike existing approaches that rely on static, single-turn assessments, the proposed framework introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize how confidence and correctness evolve as evidence accumulates during diagnostic conversations. The work systematically evaluates 27 confidence estimation methods across three medical datasets and demonstrates that current approaches struggle with medical data's complexity, particularly under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity.

Based on these findings, the authors propose MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to construct symptom profiles and align patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory evidence. MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across two LLMs and three medical datasets, achieving superior AUROC and Pearson correlation metrics while providing interpretable confidence estimates that could enhance clinical decision-making.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a comprehensive benchmark for multi-turn medical consultation confidence estimation by unifying three medical datasets for open-ended diagnostic generation. They introduce an information sufficiency gradient that characterizes confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence accumulates during consultations. The framework evaluates 27 confidence estimation methods across two LLMs and three medical datasets, measuring performance using AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics. Based on empirical findings that existing methods fail under medical data complexity, they propose MedConf, which constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with evidence relations (supporting, missing, contradictory), and aggregates these into interpretable confidence estimates. The method demonstrates consistent superiority across various evaluation conditions including information insufficiency and multimorbidity scenarios.

## Key Results
- Current confidence estimation methods show significant performance degradation when applied to medical consultation data
- Medical data amplifies inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-based confidence methods
- MedConf achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across two LLMs and three medical datasets
- The framework demonstrates superior robustness under information insufficiency and multimorbidity conditions
- Retrieval-augmented generation enables more accurate symptom profile construction for confidence estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of MedConf stems from its evidence-grounded approach to confidence estimation. Rather than relying solely on model internal signals like token probabilities or consistency measures, MedConf constructs explicit symptom profiles through retrieval-augmented generation. This allows the system to systematically assess the alignment between patient information and supporting evidence, identifying missing or contradictory information that could affect diagnostic confidence. By incorporating an information sufficiency gradient, the framework captures how confidence and correctness evolve dynamically during multi-turn consultations, addressing the limitations of static, single-turn assessments common in existing research.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Sufficiency Gradient**: Characterizes how confidence and correctness evolve as evidence accumulates during multi-turn consultations; needed to capture dynamic confidence-correctness relationships absent in static assessments; quick check: verify gradient sensitivity to incremental evidence addition
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhances symptom profile construction by incorporating external medical knowledge; needed to ground confidence estimates in evidence rather than internal model signals alone; quick check: compare performance with and without retrieval augmentation
- **Evidence Relation Alignment**: Systematically assesses supporting, missing, and contradictory information between patient data and evidence; needed to provide interpretable confidence estimates that clinicians can understand; quick check: validate alignment accuracy against ground truth evidence
- **Multi-turn Consultation Dynamics**: Captures the sequential nature of medical consultations where information is gradually revealed; needed because single-turn static assessments fail to represent real clinical workflows; quick check: compare multi-turn vs single-turn confidence estimation performance
- **AUROC and Pearson Correlation Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation framework measuring both discrimination ability and linear relationship strength; needed to provide balanced assessment of confidence estimation quality; quick check: verify metric consistency across different confidence thresholds
- **Symptom Profile Construction**: Transforms patient narratives into structured medical concepts for evidence alignment; needed to bridge unstructured patient communication with structured medical knowledge; quick check: assess profile accuracy against clinical coding standards

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Patient Narrative -> Retrieval-Augmented Generation -> Symptom Profile Construction -> Evidence Relation Alignment -> Confidence Aggregation -> Interpretable Estimate

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows patient input through retrieval augmentation to symptom profiling, then aligns this profile with evidence relations before aggregating into confidence estimates. The retrieval-augmented generation stage is critical as it grounds the symptom profiles in medical knowledge, enabling more accurate evidence alignment and subsequent confidence assessment.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes interpretability and evidence grounding over computational efficiency, leveraging retrieval augmentation which introduces latency. The choice to use linguistic self-assessment rather than pure statistical methods trades some precision for clinical interpretability. The multi-turn approach requires more complex state tracking compared to single-turn methods but better captures real consultation dynamics.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when retrieval sources are insufficient or of low quality, when patient narratives contain ambiguous or contradictory information, or when ground truth evidence is unavailable. The framework may also struggle with rare conditions not well-represented in retrieval corpora or when patient communication style significantly deviates from training data patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study comparing MedConf performance with and without retrieval augmentation to quantify knowledge grounding benefits
2. Single-turn vs multi-turn confidence estimation comparison to validate the importance of consultation dynamics
3. Cross-dataset evaluation to assess generalizability across different medical domains and patient populations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark evaluation relies on datasets with varying sizes and quality, with clinical reports being particularly small (n=120) compared to other sources
- Evaluation framework assumes ground truth diagnoses and symptom information are available, which may not reflect real-world deployment scenarios
- Information sufficiency gradient depends on subjective thresholds for determining when sufficient information has been provided
- Claims about interpretability would benefit from systematic human evaluation across diverse clinical scenarios

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Observation that medical data amplifies limitations of existing confidence estimation methods is well-supported by empirical results
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that MedConf provides "interpretable" confidence estimates would benefit from systematic human evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: Assertion of superior robustness under information insufficiency and multimorbidity is supported by ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation on independently collected clinical datasets with different disease distributions and patient populations to assess generalizability
2. Implement human-in-the-loop evaluation where clinicians assess practical utility and interpretability of MedConf confidence estimates in realistic consultation scenarios
3. Test MedConf's performance under realistic operational constraints including latency requirements, computational resource limitations, and varying quality of retrieval sources
