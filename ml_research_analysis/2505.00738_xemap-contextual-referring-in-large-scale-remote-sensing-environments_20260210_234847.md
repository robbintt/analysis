# XeMap: Contextual Referring in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.00738
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00738
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduced contextual referring map (XeMap) task and dataset; XeMap-Network achieves Rmi of 0.5789 on XeMap-Set, outperforming SeLo (0.4903) and CLIP-SeLov2.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the contextual referring map (XeMap) task, which focuses on pixel-level localization of text-referred regions in large-scale remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional image-level or object-level methods, XeMap captures mid-scale semantic entities often overlooked in RS scenes. The proposed XeMap-Network uses a fusion layer with cross-modal attention and a hierarchical multi-scale semantic alignment module to achieve precise multimodal matching. A novel dataset, XeMap-Set, is introduced with automatically generated annotations via the multiscale correlation map generation method. Evaluated in a zero-shot setting, XeMap-Network achieves an averaged unified metric (Rmi) of 0.5789 on XeMap-Set test partition, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SeLo (0.4903) and CLIP-SeLov2. Qualitative results show superior handling of complex referring expressions and spatial reasoning in RS imagery.

## Method Summary
The authors propose XeMap as a novel task for pixel-level localization of text-referred regions in large-scale remote sensing imagery, addressing the gap in existing methods that focus on image-level or object-level tasks. To tackle this challenge, they introduce the XeMap-Network, which employs a fusion layer with cross-modal attention to combine visual and textual features effectively. The network also incorporates a hierarchical multi-scale semantic alignment module to capture fine-grained spatial details and semantic relationships. To support this task, the authors create XeMap-Set, a large-scale dataset with automatically generated annotations using a multiscale correlation map generation method. The model is evaluated in a zero-shot setting, demonstrating strong performance on the test partition of XeMap-Set.

## Key Results
- XeMap-Network achieves an averaged unified metric (Rmi) of 0.5789 on XeMap-Set test partition.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods including SeLo (0.4903) and CLIP-SeLov2.
- Qualitative results demonstrate superior handling of complex referring expressions and spatial reasoning in RS imagery.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The XeMap task addresses a critical gap in remote sensing by enabling pixel-level localization of text-referred regions, which is essential for mid-scale semantic entities often overlooked in traditional RS analysis. The proposed XeMap-Network leverages cross-modal attention in its fusion layer to effectively combine visual and textual features, ensuring precise multimodal matching. The hierarchical multi-scale semantic alignment module captures fine-grained spatial details and semantic relationships, enabling the model to handle complex referring expressions and spatial reasoning. The automatically generated annotations in XeMap-Set provide a scalable solution for training data, though the quality and reliability of these annotations remain a concern.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal attention:** Combines visual and textual features for multimodal matching. Needed to align text descriptions with corresponding image regions. Quick check: Verify attention weights focus on relevant regions.
- **Hierarchical multi-scale semantic alignment:** Captures spatial details and semantic relationships across scales. Needed to handle mid-scale semantic entities in RS imagery. Quick check: Ensure alignment is consistent across different scales.
- **Multiscale correlation map generation:** Automates annotation creation for large-scale datasets. Needed to scale dataset creation without manual labeling. Quick check: Validate generated annotations against ground truth.
- **Zero-shot evaluation:** Tests model generalization without fine-tuning. Needed to assess robustness across unseen data. Quick check: Compare performance on in-domain vs. out-of-domain data.
- **Rmi (unified metric):** Evaluates pixel-level localization accuracy. Needed to quantify model performance on mid-scale semantic entities. Quick check: Ensure metric captures both precision and recall.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Image Encoder -> Text Encoder -> Fusion Layer (Cross-modal Attention) -> Hierarchical Multi-scale Semantic Alignment Module -> Output

### Critical Path
The critical path involves encoding visual and textual inputs, fusing them via cross-modal attention, and aligning features hierarchically across scales to produce the final pixel-level localization map.

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Fusion layer:** Cross-modal attention enables precise multimodal matching but increases computational complexity.
- **Hierarchical alignment:** Captures fine-grained spatial details but requires careful tuning of scale parameters.
- **Automatic annotations:** Scalable dataset creation but introduces uncertainty in annotation quality.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor localization accuracy when referring expressions are ambiguous or overly complex.
- Reduced performance on out-of-domain data due to reliance on zero-shot evaluation.
- Inconsistent alignment across scales in the hierarchical module.

### First 3 Experiments
1. Validate cross-modal attention weights focus on relevant image regions for given text queries.
2. Test hierarchical alignment module on synthetic data with known spatial relationships.
3. Evaluate model performance on a small subset of manually annotated data to verify annotation quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on zero-shot setting without ablation studies to isolate architectural contributions.
- Dataset generation method introduces uncertainty in annotation quality due to lack of human verification.
- Performance validated only on XeMap-Set, limiting generalizability to other remote sensing datasets.

## Confidence
- **Performance claims:** Medium (zero-shot evaluation and limited dataset diversity)
- **Dataset quality:** Medium (automatic generation without human verification)
- **Generalizability:** Low (single dataset evaluation)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of the fusion layer and hierarchical semantic alignment module.
2. Evaluate model performance on at least two additional remote sensing datasets to assess cross-dataset generalization.
3. Perform human evaluation studies to verify the quality and reliability of the automatically generated annotations in XeMap-Set.
