# Global Solutions to Non-Convex Functional Constrained Problems with Hidden Convexity

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.10626
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10626
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First provable algorithms for global solutions to non-convex constrained problems with hidden convexity

## Executive Summary
This paper develops the first provable algorithms to find global solutions for non-convex constrained optimization problems with hidden convexity, where the problem admits a convex reformulation under an unknown variable transformation. The key challenge is that the transformation is implicit or unknown, making direct use of the convex reformulation impossible, while standard gradient methods applied to the original non-convex formulation may fail due to constraints. The authors propose two distinct algorithmic frameworks: a modified inexact proximal point method with shifted constraints, and a bundle-level method with shifted constraints that achieves better complexity in the smooth setting.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses non-convex constrained optimization problems where the objective and constraints can be expressed as convex functions of an unknown transformation c(x). Two algorithmic approaches are proposed. The first is a modified inexact proximal point method (IPPM) with shifted constraints that preserves feasibility at each iteration by adding a violation budget τ to the constraint. This allows each subproblem to satisfy Slater's condition, enabling use of efficient convex optimization methods as inner solvers. The second approach is a bundle-level method with shifted constraints that avoids the quadratic dependence on ε in the smooth setting. When the optimal value is known, the shifted star bundle-level algorithm achieves O(ε⁻¹) complexity, while an adaptive line-search procedure is used when the optimal value is unknown.

## Key Results
- First provable algorithms for global solutions to non-convex constrained problems with hidden convexity
- IPPM method achieves O(ε⁻³) oracle complexity for non-smooth problems using switching subgradient methods
- IPPM method achieves O(ε⁻²) oracle complexity for smooth problems using accelerated constrained gradient descent
- Bundle-level method achieves O(ε⁻¹) oracle complexity in smooth setting when optimal value is known
- Both methods make no constraint qualification assumptions and can handle equality constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Shifted Constraints for Artificial Slater Points
The method adds a "violation budget" τ to the constraint in the subproblem. By geometric analysis of the hidden transformation c(x), the authors prove that a point exists which strictly satisfies this relaxed constraint, thereby creating a "Slater point" where none might have existed in the original formulation.

### Mechanism 2: Geometry of the Hidden Transformation
The convergence analysis relies on functional and norm inequalities derived from the hidden convexity structure. The authors utilize the property that for any two points, the distance in the transformed space is bounded by the distance in the original space scaled by μc.

### Mechanism 3: Linearization Shifting in Bundle-Level Methods
Standard linear lower bounds fail in non-convex settings; shifting these linearizations restores their validity as global lower models. The "Shifted Star Bundle-level" algorithm shifts the linearized objective and constraints based on the weak convexity parameter ρ.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Weak Convexity & Proximal Point Method (PPM)**
  - Why needed here: The paper frames the non-convex problem as a sequence of strongly convex subproblems using regularization
  - Quick check question: How does adding a quadratic term ρ/2||x - x(k)||² convert a ρ-weakly convex function into a convex one?

- **Concept: Slater's Condition & Constraint Qualifications (CQs)**
  - Why needed here: A major contribution is removing CQ assumptions
  - Quick check question: Why does standard gradient descent on constraints fail if the constraint is active at the optimum but no strictly feasible point exists?

- **Concept: Hidden Convexity (e.g., Geometric Programming)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Geometric Programming (GP) as a primary example
  - Quick check question: If a function F(x) is non-convex, but F(e^y) is convex in y, how do you calculate the sub-gradient of F with respect to x using the chain rule?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: IPPM Loop (Outer) -> Subproblem Solver (Inner) -> Transformation (Theoretical)
- **Critical path**: The viability of the entire system rests on Lemma 1 (HC-Slater's Lemma). If the subproblem solver cannot find a strictly feasible point for the shifted constraint, the outer loop cannot guarantee progress.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy (ε) vs. Feasibility (τ): The constraint shift τ acts as a violation budget. Setting τ ~ ε ensures convergence but requires the initial point to be roughly ε-feasible.
- **Failure signatures**: Cycling in Bundle-Level: If the shift τ is too small, the algorithm may oscillate between boundary points. Inner Loop Divergence: If the Slater gap ατ/2 is extremely small, the inner ACGD solver may struggle numerically to distinguish between feasible and infeasible points.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. 2D Geometric Program (Ex-CGP): Implement the S-StarBL algorithm on the example F1(x) = x1·x2 + 4/x1 + 1/x2. Plot the iterates in both the original non-convex domain X and the "hidden" convex domain U to verify the "zig-zag" convergence pattern.
  2. Slater Gap Stress Test: Run IPPM on a problem where the feasible region is a single point. Verify that the shifted constraint mechanism allows the solver to converge to this point.
  3. Complexity Scaling: Run the high-dimensional constrained geometric program (d=100) comparing the Switching Subgradient (SwSG) vs. ACGD inner solvers. Plot oracle calls vs. accuracy to confirm the theoretical O(ε⁻³) vs O(ε⁻²) scaling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can simple single-loop methods be developed for hidden convex constrained optimization that avoid the complexity of solving quadratic linearly constrained subproblems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "It would be interesting to develop simple single-loop methods without additional quadratic linearly constrained subproblems, e.g., similar to [Pol67; HL23]."

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the minimax optimal gradient complexities for the class of hidden convex optimization problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note, "...we still do not know what are the minimax optimal gradient complexities of hidden convex optimization."

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can regularization strategies in the convex domain U (rather than the original domain X) improve convergence, particularly in applications like convex reinforcement learning where the transformation map c(·) can be approximated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest, "...it is conceptually possible to regularize the iterates in the U-space and leverage hidden convexity... this direction might be potentially useful in specific applications, e.g. convex reinforcement learning."

## Limitations

- Theoretical analysis critically depends on the existence and properties of the hidden transformation c(x), which is assumed but never observed by the algorithm
- Complexity bounds assume perfect knowledge of problem parameters (weak convexity ρ, hidden convexity constant μc, diameter D, etc.)
- Adaptive line-search procedure for estimating F* in the unknown-optimal-value setting lacks theoretical guarantees
- May fail for problems with only approximate hidden convexity or when the transformation has poor conditioning

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The algorithmic frameworks (IPPM with shifted constraints, Bundle-level with linearization shifting) are sound and the oracle complexity bounds for smooth/non-smooth variants are mathematically rigorous under stated assumptions
- **Medium confidence**: The artificial Slater point construction works for problems with explicit hidden convexity (like GP), but may fail for problems with only approximate hidden convexity or when the transformation has poor conditioning (μc → 0)
- **Low confidence**: The adaptive line-search procedure for estimating F* in the unknown-optimal-value setting lacks theoretical guarantees and may exhibit poor practical performance without additional heuristics

## Next Checks

1. **Hidden Convexity Robustness Test**: Apply the algorithms to problems with approximate rather than exact hidden convexity (e.g., perturbed GPs or problems with small non-convex residuals). Measure how the convergence rate degrades as the hidden convexity assumption becomes violated.

2. **Parameter-Free Implementation**: Implement adaptive estimation procedures for ρ, μc, and D within the algorithms. Compare the practical performance against the idealized theoretical rates that assume these parameters are known.

3. **Constraint Qualification Stress Test**: Systematically evaluate algorithm performance across problems with varying degrees of constraint qualification violation. Quantify the trade-off between shift parameter τ and convergence robustness for problems ranging from strongly feasible to singleton feasible sets.
