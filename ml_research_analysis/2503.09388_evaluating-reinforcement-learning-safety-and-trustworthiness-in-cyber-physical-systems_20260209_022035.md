# Evaluating Reinforcement Learning Safety and Trustworthiness in Cyber-Physical Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.09388
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09388
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: SAFE-RL framework provides structured safety assessment for RL in CPS through 25 targeted questions mapped to four trustworthiness dimensions

## Executive Summary
The SAFE-RL framework addresses critical safety assessment challenges in reinforcement learning systems for Cyber-Physical Systems through a structured, question-based approach. It adapts Goal Structured Notation to create a hierarchical framework that systematically evaluates trustworthiness across four dimensions: robustness, safety, generalizability, and transparency. The framework was developed through three iterative design science cycles with RL experts and validated across three distinct use cases in small Uncrewed Aerial Systems, demonstrating practical applicability while identifying specific safety gaps that require attention.

## Method Summary
The SAFE-RL framework employs a hierarchical Goal Structured Notation approach with four node types: high-level goals (Real-World Readiness & Adaptability, Risk Management, Human-Centric Alignment), subgoals (9 total), ASK nodes (25 critical questions tagged by trustworthiness dimension), and evidence nodes (supported answers). The framework was developed iteratively with RL experts through three design science cycles, then validated across three sUAS applications: obstacle avoidance, battery efficiency optimization, and autonomous ground vehicle control. Each use case applied the 25 ASK nodes, documenting evidence for trustworthiness dimensions.

## Key Results
- Successfully validated across three RL applications in small Uncrewed Aerial Systems
- Framework identifies critical safety gaps, with E1 marking several questions as "N/A" due to lack of human oversight
- All three use cases demonstrated framework applicability for documenting safety-critical decisions
- ASK nodes effectively prompt critical evaluation rather than confirmation bias in safety assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Goal Decomposition via Structured Inquiry
The SAFE-RL framework breaks down abstract safety goals into a four-level hierarchy: Goals → Subgoals → ASK nodes → Evidence nodes. This structured approach forces systematic coverage of trustworthiness dimensions by requiring users to traverse from high-level objectives to granular, verifiable claims. The hierarchy ensures comprehensive evaluation rather than ad-hoc safety assessment.

### Mechanism 2: Critical "ASK" Nodes for Bias Mitigation
Unlike traditional safety assurance cases that may reinforce confirmation bias, SAFE-RL's ASK nodes are designed to "prompt stakeholders to critically evaluate whether their system meets specified requirements." This inquiry-based approach forces engineers to confront uncertainties and potential failures rather than assuming safety, as evidenced by C2's "?" response for simulation fidelity questions.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Expert Validation for Domain Relevance
The framework underwent three design science iterations with RL experts (C1, C2, E1) who refined the hierarchy for practical applicability. External expert E1 provided critical feedback that improved goal specificity, particularly for robustness. Validation across three distinct sUAS use cases demonstrated the framework's ability to surface concrete evidence types and identify real safety gaps.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**: RL agents learn through environmental interaction, creating inherent uncertainty and risks (like sim-to-real gaps) not present in traditional software. Quick check: Can you explain why an RL agent that performs perfectly in simulation might fail dangerously on a real robotic platform?

- **Safety Assurance Cases & Goal Structured Notation (GSN)**: A safety case is a structured argument linking high-level goals to specific evidence through logical hierarchy, not just test reports. Quick check: What's the fundamental difference between a testing log and a safety assurance case?

- **Trustworthiness Dimensions**: The framework's 25 questions map to four pillars: robustness (system reliability), safety (harm prevention), generalizability (performance across conditions), and transparency (explainability). Quick check: For an autonomous drone, what's the difference between a robustness failure and a safety failure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Goals (e.g., Real-World Readiness) → Subgoals (e.g., Scenario Diversity) → ASK Nodes (25 critical questions) → Evidence Nodes (supported answers)
- **Critical path**: Select Goal/Subgoal → Interpret ASK Node → Identify Evidence → Validate against Trustworthiness Dimensions. Evidence identification is most critical step.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Comprehensiveness vs. Usability (25 questions demand significant time), Structure vs. Flexibility (fixed hierarchy may not align with all architectures), Prescriptive vs. Customizable Evidence (predefined options vs. custom text).
- **Failure signatures**: Overuse of "N/A" (system misalignment), "?" or partial evidence (design gaps), checklist mentality (superficial completion without critical evaluation).
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Single-Goal Gap Analysis: Apply only Goal 2 (Risk Management) ASK nodes to existing RL project, document weak/missing evidence without fixing.
  2. Evidence Type Mapping: Practice answering 3-4 ASK nodes for simple system (e.g., thermostat), focus on clear evidence statements.
  3. Failure Mode Back-Trace: Choose hypothetical failure (e.g., robot arm collision), trace backwards to identify which ASK nodes should have caught risk.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework generalizability beyond sUAS domain remains uncertain with only three validation use cases
- No quantitative safety performance metrics reported to demonstrate actual risk reduction
- Full text of all 25 ASK nodes not provided, requiring inference from subgoal descriptions
- Evidence supporting bias mitigation claims is largely theoretical without empirical validation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Structural approach using Goal Structured Notation is well-documented and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Iterative expert validation process described in detail, but expert panel representativeness limits broader claims
- **Low Confidence**: Bias mitigation and real-world safety impact claims lack empirical validation beyond three sUAS case studies

## Next Checks
1. Apply SAFE-RL to non-aerial CPS domain (e.g., autonomous vehicle or medical device) and compare risk identification completeness against traditional safety assessment methods
2. Conduct controlled study measuring whether ASK node completion actually reduces confirmation bias by comparing safety assessments with and without the framework
3. Develop and publish complete set of 25 ASK questions to enable independent validation and cross-project comparability
