## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08981

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AGENT, a large language model-based tool for generating and evaluating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designs. AGENT is built on the CodeT5+ LLM and fine-tuned on the AircraftVerse dataset, which contains UAV designs and physics simulation results. The model learns to generate UAV designs conditioned on desired flight properties and can act as a surrogate for the physics simulator. Experiments show AGENT achieves high accuracy in predicting design success and flight dynamics metrics, with R² scores ranging from 0.161 to 0.944 for various properties. The model can also generate designs meeting specified constraints like hover time and number of propellers. AGENT is deployable on a single GPU and runs an order of magnitude faster than the underlying simulator, enabling rapid human-AI collaboration in UAV design.

## Method Summary
AGENT is built on the CodeT5+ LLM and fine-tuned on the AircraftVerse dataset, which contains 27,714 UAV designs represented as JSON design trees and their corresponding physics simulation outputs. The model is trained using a curriculum learning approach with four task types: component generation/name prediction, conditional design generation, design tree masking, and surrogate modeling. The model is fine-tuned for 50,000 steps using AdamW optimizer with weight decay 0.1, learning rate 1e-4, and gradient clipping. Inference uses beam search with a beam size of 10. AGENT can generate UAV designs conditioned on desired flight properties and can act as a surrogate for the physics simulator, predicting design success and flight dynamics metrics.

## Key Results
- AGENT achieves high accuracy in predicting design success and flight dynamics metrics, with R² scores ranging from 0.161 to 0.944 for various properties.
- The model can generate designs meeting specified constraints like hover time and number of propellers.
- AGENT is deployable on a single GPU and runs an order of magnitude faster than the underlying simulator, enabling rapid human-AI collaboration in UAV design.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The CodeT5+ foundation provides strong language understanding and generation capabilities that transfer well to UAV design representations. The curriculum learning approach likely helps the model learn hierarchical design patterns by starting with simpler tasks and progressively learning more complex relationships. The design tree representation allows the model to capture structural dependencies between UAV components, enabling it to generate valid and functional designs.

## Foundational Learning
1. CodeT5+ LLM: A pretrained encoder-decoder model for code and text generation. Why needed: Provides a strong foundation for learning UAV design representations and generating new designs. Quick check: Verify the model is loaded correctly and can generate simple UAV components.
2. Curriculum learning: A training approach that gradually increases task complexity. Why needed: Helps the model learn to generate and evaluate UAV designs more effectively by starting with simpler tasks and progressing to more complex ones. Quick check: Monitor training loss and performance on validation tasks to ensure the curriculum is working as intended.
3. Design tree representation: UAV designs are represented as JSON trees with components as nodes. Why needed: Allows the model to learn structural relationships between UAV components and generate valid designs. Quick check: Verify that generated designs are valid JSON trees with appropriate component relationships.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
CodeT5+ (220M params) -> AircraftVerse dataset (14,273 designs) -> Curriculum learning (4 tasks) -> Beam search inference (beam size 10)

### Critical Path
1. Load CodeT5+ model and AircraftVerse dataset
2. Preprocess designs and create 80/10/10 train/val/test splits
3. Implement curriculum learning with 4 task types
4. Fine-tune model for 50,000 steps with specified hyperparameters
5. Evaluate on held-out test designs using beam search inference

### Design Tradeoffs
- Single GPU deployment vs. distributed training: Chosen for accessibility and ease of deployment, but may limit scalability.
- Beam search vs. sampling: Beam search provides more consistent results, while sampling may increase diversity at the cost of some accuracy.

### Failure Signatures
- Negative or low R² on flight dynamics: Indicates issues with the design tree masking task or batch balance.
- Generated designs violate constraints: Suggests problems with encoder conditioning or insufficient masking during training.
- GPU OOM: May require reducing beam size, disabling parallel generation, or using 16-bit precision.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Verify successful loading of CodeT5+ model and generation of simple UAV components.
2. Implement and test the design tree masking task with varying masking percentages.
3. Fine-tune the model on a small subset of the dataset and evaluate performance on a held-out validation set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the reviewed text.

## Limitations
- Dependency on access to the AircraftVerse dataset, which is not publicly available through standard repositories.
- Curriculum learning approach with four distinct task types introduces complexity that could affect outcomes if any component is implemented incorrectly.
- Masking strategy details remain underspecified, particularly regarding the percentage of nodes to mask and the selection criteria for leaves versus subtrees.

## Confidence
High confidence: The core methodology using CodeT5+ with fine-tuning, beam search inference, and the specified training configuration (weight decay, learning rate schedule, batch size) is clearly documented and follows standard practices. The evaluation metrics (classification accuracy and R² scores) are appropriately chosen for the dual objectives of design generation and surrogate modeling.

Medium confidence: The reported performance improvements over baselines and the specific R² values across different flight dynamics metrics are plausible given the model architecture and training approach, but would require exact replication of the dataset and curriculum implementation to verify. The claimed order-of-magnitude speedup over the physics simulator is reasonable but depends on the specific simulator implementation not detailed in the paper.

## Next Checks
1. Verify successful access to AircraftVerse dataset and replicate the exact filtering process (≤512 tokens) and train/validation/test split ratios (80/10/10) to ensure data consistency with the original experiments.

2. Implement and test the design tree masking curriculum task with varying masking percentages and selection strategies to determine optimal configuration that balances learning efficiency with coverage of structural variations in UAV designs.

3. Conduct ablation studies on the four curriculum tasks to quantify the contribution of each component, particularly comparing performance with and without the design tree masking task to validate its importance for the reported R² improvements.
