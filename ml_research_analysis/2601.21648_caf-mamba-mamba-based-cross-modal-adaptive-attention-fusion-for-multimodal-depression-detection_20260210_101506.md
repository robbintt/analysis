# CAF-Mamba: Mamba-Based Cross-Modal Adaptive Attention Fusion for Multimodal Depression Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21648
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21648
- Reference count: 0
- Key result: State-of-the-art performance on LMVD (78.69% accuracy, 78.26% precision, 79.12% F1) and D-Vlog datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for multimodal depression detection that explicitly models cross-modal interactions and dynamically adjusts modality contributions via an attention mechanism. Unlike prior methods relying on simple concatenation or static fusion, CAF-Mamba integrates unimodal extraction, cross-modal interaction encoding, and adaptive attention fusion into a unified pipeline. The approach addresses the challenge of effectively combining information from multiple modalities (video, audio, text) to improve depression detection accuracy.

## Method Summary
CAF-Mamba employs a three-stage architecture: unimodal feature extraction, cross-modal interaction encoding using Mamba blocks, and adaptive attention fusion for final prediction. The Mamba architecture replaces traditional Transformers to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently while capturing temporal patterns across modalities. The adaptive attention mechanism dynamically weighs each modality's contribution based on their relevance to depression indicators, allowing the model to focus on the most informative signals while suppressing noise from less relevant modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LMVD dataset: 78.69% accuracy, 78.26% precision, 79.12% F1 score
- Outperforms existing approaches by 1.81% in accuracy on LMVD dataset
- Shows effectiveness of both cross-modal interaction and adaptive fusion components through ablation studies
- Demonstrates superior inference speed and scalability compared to Transformer-based models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging Mamba's selective state spaces to efficiently process sequential data across multiple modalities while maintaining long-range dependencies. The cross-modal interaction encoding captures temporal correlations between modalities that are critical for depression detection, such as the relationship between facial expressions and speech patterns. The adaptive attention fusion dynamically weights each modality's contribution based on their predictive value for depression, allowing the model to prioritize relevant signals and suppress noise from less informative modalities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Mamba Architecture**: Selective state spaces for efficient sequence modeling - needed to handle long-range dependencies in multimodal temporal data; quick check: verify parameter efficiency vs Transformers
- **Cross-modal Interaction Encoding**: Capturing temporal correlations between modalities - needed because depression manifests through synchronized multimodal signals; quick check: validate correlation patterns match clinical depression indicators
- **Adaptive Attention Fusion**: Dynamic weighting of modality contributions - needed to focus on most informative signals while suppressing noise; quick check: test attention weight stability across different depression severity levels
- **Multimodal Depression Detection**: Integrating video, audio, and text features - needed for comprehensive assessment of depression symptoms; quick check: verify performance gains when adding/removing modalities
- **Selective State Spaces**: Memory-efficient alternative to attention mechanisms - needed for scalable processing of long sequences; quick check: compare memory usage with equivalent Transformer models
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Identifying depression indicators across time - needed because depression symptoms evolve over interaction duration; quick check: analyze performance across different temporal segments

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Unimodal Extraction -> Cross-Modal Interaction Encoding -> Adaptive Attention Fusion

Critical Path: The model processes each modality through separate feature extractors, then uses Mamba blocks to capture cross-modal temporal interactions, followed by adaptive attention fusion that produces final depression classification scores.

Design Tradeoffs: Mamba architecture trades some modeling capacity for significant efficiency gains compared to Transformers. The adaptive attention mechanism adds complexity but enables dynamic modality weighting. The cross-modal interaction stage requires careful synchronization of temporal features across modalities.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on datasets with highly unbalanced modalities, degraded accuracy when temporal alignment between modalities is imperfect, potential overfitting when training data is limited for certain modality combinations.

First Experiments:
1. Test unimodal baselines to establish baseline performance for each individual modality
2. Evaluate performance with cross-modal interaction but without adaptive attention fusion
3. Test adaptive attention fusion on concatenated modality features without Mamba cross-modal encoding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluated only on two in-the-wild video-based depression datasets, limiting generalizability to other modalities and populations
- Reported improvements represent modest gains (1.81% accuracy improvement), suggesting method may not fundamentally change performance ceiling
- Efficiency claims lack detailed benchmarking methodology and absolute runtime measurements

## Confidence

High confidence: The technical implementation of Mamba-based cross-modal interaction encoding and adaptive attention fusion is well-described and internally consistent. The state-of-the-art performance claims on the tested datasets are directly supported by the reported metrics.

Medium confidence: The generalizability of the model to other multimodal depression datasets and real-world clinical settings. The efficiency advantages over Transformer-based approaches are claimed but not thoroughly validated with standardized benchmarks.

Low confidence: The scalability analysis beyond the tested datasets, particularly regarding how the model would perform with additional modalities or in low-resource settings with limited training data.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Evaluate CAF-Mamba on at least two additional multimodal depression datasets with different modality combinations (e.g., clinical interviews with text transcripts, wearable sensor data with self-reports) to assess generalization across data sources.

2. **Component contribution analysis**: Conduct a more granular ablation study that isolates the individual contributions of Mamba-based cross-modal interaction versus adaptive attention fusion, and test performance when each component is used independently.

3. **Efficiency benchmarking**: Perform standardized runtime comparisons against Transformer-based models using identical hardware configurations, measuring not just inference speed but also memory usage, training time, and scalability with increasing sequence lengths and modality counts.
