# You Only Debias Once: Towards Flexible Accuracy-Fairness Trade-offs at Inference Time

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.07066
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07066
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves flexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time using a single model trained once

## Executive Summary
YODO introduces a novel approach to address the inflexibility of existing fairness methods that offer fixed accuracy-fairness trade-offs requiring multiple models. The method learns an objective-diverse neural network subspace with two endpoints - one optimized for accuracy and one for fairness. By selecting different points along the line connecting these endpoints using parameter α, YODO enables varying trade-offs at ultra-low inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate comparable performance to fixed models while providing flexible trade-offs across tabular and image datasets.

## Method Summary
YODO trains a single model to create a neural network subspace with two distinct endpoints representing accuracy-optimized and fairness-optimized models. The subspace is constructed through a specialized training process that encourages diversity in optimization objectives. At inference time, a parameter α selects different points along the line connecting the endpoints, allowing real-time adjustment of the accuracy-fairness trade-off without retraining. This approach eliminates the need for multiple models while maintaining performance comparable to fixed trade-off methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves flexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time using a single trained model
- Demonstrates ultra-low computational overhead (3.53 seconds for 100 trade-off levels vs 425 seconds for training 100 fixed models on ACS-E dataset)
- Shows comparable performance to fixed models on both tabular and image datasets
- Enables real-time adjustment of fairness levels without model retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
YODO leverages the concept of a neural network subspace to encode multiple optimization objectives within a single model architecture. By training to create two distinct endpoints representing different optimization priorities, the method establishes a continuum of solutions. The linear interpolation between these endpoints allows for smooth transitions between accuracy and fairness objectives. This approach exploits the geometric properties of neural network parameter spaces to maintain performance while enabling flexibility, effectively trading off some representational capacity for operational flexibility.

## Foundational Learning
- **Neural network subspaces**: Understanding how models can be represented as points in high-dimensional parameter space, enabling interpolation between solutions
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balancing competing objectives (accuracy vs fairness) through careful parameter space exploration
- **Inference-time flexibility**: Recognizing that post-training adjustments can provide practical advantages over fixed models
- **Computational efficiency trade-offs**: Evaluating the balance between training complexity and inference flexibility

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Neural Network -> Endpoint A (Accuracy-optimized) & Endpoint B (Fairness-optimized) -> α Parameter -> Interpolated Model -> Output

**Critical Path**: The core innovation lies in the training phase that creates two diverse endpoints, followed by the linear interpolation mechanism controlled by α. The quality of the endpoints directly determines the effectiveness of the trade-off continuum.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method sacrifices some representational capacity by constraining solutions to a subspace rather than allowing fully independent models. However, this trade-off enables significant computational savings and operational flexibility that outweigh the potential performance limitations in most practical scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor endpoint diversity resulting in a narrow or ineffective trade-off continuum, computational overhead during training phase that negates inference benefits, and sensitivity of the α parameter to dataset characteristics that may require recalibration for different domains.

**First 3 Experiments**: 
1. Train YODO on a simple tabular dataset with known fairness issues to verify endpoint diversity
2. Compare inference time overhead of YODO vs multiple fixed models across varying numbers of trade-off levels
3. Evaluate performance degradation when moving away from optimal endpoints along the trade-off continuum

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- The linear subspace assumption may not capture complex, non-linear trade-off relationships in some scenarios
- Potential impact on model interpretability when using interpolated solutions
- Risk of unintended bias amplification along certain points in the trade-off continuum
- Limited validation across diverse model architectures and fairness metrics

## Confidence
- **Core methodology**: High - The subspace approach is theoretically sound and well-supported
- **Computational efficiency claims**: High - The 3.53 vs 425 seconds comparison is compelling and specific
- **Generalizability**: Medium - Results need validation across more diverse datasets and model types
- **Absence of unintended consequences**: Medium - The impact on interpretability and potential bias amplification requires further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Test YODO on a diverse set of datasets, including those with different data distributions and feature types, to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate YODO's performance with various fairness metrics beyond those used in the original experiments to ensure broad applicability
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine how changes in the number of training epochs or model architecture affect the quality and stability of the trade-off continuum
