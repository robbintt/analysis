# Breaking the accuracy-resource dilemma: a lightweight adaptive video inference enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14568
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14568
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Adaptive video inference system that dynamically switches between YOLOv8 model scales using fuzzy logic to balance resource utilization and detection accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a lightweight adaptive video inference framework that addresses the trade-off between accuracy and computational resources. The system employs a fuzzy logic controller that monitors GPU utilization, temperature, and target count to dynamically select between YOLOv8 small, medium, or large models. By incorporating a spatiotemporal stability mechanism, the framework prevents oscillation while maintaining real-time performance. The approach demonstrates improved resource efficiency without significant accuracy degradation across two video datasets.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a fuzzy controller (FC-r) with three inputs: GPU utilization (GU), GPU temperature (GT), and number of targets (NT). These inputs are fuzzified using membership functions, then processed through a rule base to determine the optimal model scale. A safety mechanism requires K consecutive frames of the same recommendation before executing a model switch. The system was evaluated on VisDrone (350 frames) and UA-DETRAC (2000 frames) datasets using YOLOv8 s/m/l variants, measuring resource efficiency (AVTG), detection accuracy, and thermal performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves balanced resource utilization without significant accuracy loss through dynamic model scaling
- Implements stability mechanism that reduces model switches to 24 over 2000 frames
- Demonstrates thermal management capabilities by mitigating rapid temperature increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Fuzzy Logic-based Resource-State Mapping
The system maps continuous hardware metrics into discrete model-selection decisions using fuzzy logic. The Fuzzy Controller (FC-r) ingests GPU utilization (GU), GPU temperature (GT), and number of targets (NT), converting them into fuzzy sets via membership functions. A rule base determines the firing strength for selecting large, medium, or small models based on these inputs.

### Mechanism 2: Spatiotemporal Stability Gating
The framework maintains inference stability by exploiting temporal continuity of video frames. It enforces a safety mechanism where model switches are only executed if the same model is recommended for K consecutive frames, preventing oscillation and ensuring smooth transitions.

### Mechanism 3: Dynamic Thermal/Load Balancing
The system proactively downgrades model complexity in response to thermal or computational stress. When GPU temperature or utilization is high, fuzzy rules prioritize smaller models to reduce computational load and heat generation, creating a negative feedback loop for thermal control.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fuzzy Control Systems (Mamdani-style)**: Essential for understanding how crisp numbers translate into linguistic variables and rule aggregation. Quick check: Can you explain how the "max" aggregation operator resolves conflicting fuzzy rules?
- **Model Scaling in Object Detection (e.g., YOLO)**: Required to understand latency/accuracy trade-offs between YOLOv8 variants. Quick check: What is the parameter count and latency difference between YOLOv8 's' and 'l' models on your target hardware?
- **Spatiotemporal Correlation in Video**: Justifies the assumption that adjacent frames can use the same optimal model. Quick check: How does frame rate affect the validity of assuming correlation between frame N and frame N+K?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sensors (GPU monitors + video input) -> Controller (FC-r: fuzzifier -> rule base -> defuzzifier) -> Executor (model loader/switcher + inference engine)
- **Critical path**: 1) Extract metrics (GU, GT, NT) from current frame/state. 2) Compute membership degrees (fuzzification). 3) Evaluate rule table to determine target model scale. 4) Check switching safety counter (K); if threshold met, swap model.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Responsiveness vs. Stability (increasing K prevents oscillation but delays adaptation); Rule Complexity vs. Overhead (complex rules may increase latency on weak edge devices).
- **Failure signatures**: Oscillation (rapid switching between models); Thermal runaway (temperature rises despite switching to small models); Accuracy collapse (detection count drops during complex scenes).
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Static profiling: Measure latency, power, and mAP for YOLOv8 s/m/l individually on target hardware. 2) Rule validation: Log FC-r outputs on saved video to verify logical triggers. 3) Threshold sweeping: Run adaptive system with varying K values to identify optimal balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Manual fuzzy rule base may not generalize to heterogeneous hardware without expert retuning
- Dynamic model switching introduces latency overhead and throughput jitter not fully quantified
- Controller sensitivity to false positives in target detection input remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Spatiotemporal gating mechanism is clearly described and empirically validated
- **Medium Confidence**: Fuzzy logic framework structure is detailed but lacks complete parameterization
- **Low Confidence**: Dynamic thermal balancing effectiveness depends on unreported fuzzy rule specifics

## Next Checks
1. Request complete membership function definitions and defuzzification method for faithful FC-r reproduction
2. Verify whether stated "Low GU → Large Model" rule is intentional or erroneous by testing inverted logic
3. Subject adaptive system to rapid scene changes/thermal spikes to measure controller response lag and accuracy impact
