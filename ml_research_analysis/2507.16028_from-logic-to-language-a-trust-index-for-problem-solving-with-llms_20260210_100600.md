# From Logic to Language: A Trust Index for Problem Solving with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.16028
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16028
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Introduces a formal trust index framework for evaluating LLM problem-solving that moves beyond binary correctness to capture continuous solution adequacy through multi-dimensional quality measures

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) problem-solving performance beyond simple correctness metrics. The authors propose a formal framework that distinguishes between formally solvable problems, natural language addressable problems, and LLM-addressable problems, recognizing that many real-world problems exist in an inherently ambiguous and subjective space. They introduce a trust index Q as a vector-valued measure that captures solution quality across multiple dimensions, particularly focusing on normalized bi-semantic entropy (measuring semantic robustness) and emotional valence (quantifying subjective solution valuation). The framework is demonstrated through a toy model showing how these concepts can be operationalized in practice.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes a formal problem space framework distinguishing between PFormal (formally solvable problems), PNL (natural language addressable problems), and PLLM (LLM-addressable problems). It introduces a trust index Q as a vector-valued measure capturing solution quality across multiple dimensions. The authors define two concrete quality dimensions: normalized bi-semantic entropy, which measures semantic robustness across different problem formulations by computing entropy of solutions when problems are reformulated, and emotional valence, which quantifies subjective valuation of solutions through LLM-based persona evaluators. A toy model application demonstrates implementation using GPT-4, with three personas (student, teacher, philosopher) evaluating generated solutions and computing emotional valence and variance metrics.

## Key Results
- Introduces a formal framework for evaluating LLM problem-solving that moves beyond binary correctness to continuous adequacy measures
- Proposes a trust index Q as a vector-valued measure capturing solution quality across multiple dimensions
- Demonstrates normalized bi-semantic entropy as a metric for semantic robustness across different problem formulations
- Shows emotional valence as a measure of subjective solution valuation using LLM-based persona evaluators
- Provides a toy model implementation showing practical computation of the proposed quality dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that LLM problem-solving operates in a space fundamentally different from classical formal problem solving. While traditional approaches seek binary correct/incorrect answers, LLM applications must handle ambiguity, subjectivity, and the continuous nature of natural language adequacy. By defining distinct problem spaces and introducing multi-dimensional quality measures, the framework captures the nuanced reality of LLM outputs. The normalized bi-semantic entropy measures how solution quality varies with problem formulation, reflecting the robustness needed for real-world applications. Emotional valence captures the subjective valuation aspect that is often critical for user satisfaction. Together, these create a trust index that better reflects the practical utility of LLM solutions.

## Foundational Learning
**Problem Space Classification**: Why needed - to distinguish between problems requiring formal correctness versus those accepting natural language solutions; Quick check - verify problem belongs to PNL or PLLM before applying trust index
**Vector-Valued Quality Measures**: Why needed - binary correctness insufficient for natural language solutions; Quick check - ensure all quality dimensions are normalized to comparable scales
**Semantic Entropy Computation**: Why needed - to measure solution robustness across different problem formulations; Quick check - verify entropy calculation captures meaningful variation in outputs
**LLM-as-Judge Architecture**: Why needed - to operationalize subjective quality measures at scale; Quick check - validate judge consistency across different persona configurations
**Threshold Setting Methodology**: Why needed - to translate continuous quality measures into actionable decisions; Quick check - verify thresholds correlate with actual user satisfaction in target domain
**Bi-Semantic Analysis**: Why needed - to capture how solution quality varies with problem formulation; Quick check - ensure reformulation preserves problem semantics while varying surface form

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Problem Space Classifier -> Trust Index Calculator -> Quality Dimension Modules (NSE, Emotional Valence) -> Threshold Comparator -> Decision Output

**Critical Path**: Problem formulation → Solution generation → Quality evaluation → Trust index computation → Threshold comparison → Decision making

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades formal correctness guarantees for practical utility in handling ambiguous, real-world problems. It requires multiple LLM calls (for persona evaluation and reformulation) increasing computational cost, but provides richer quality assessment. The choice between human-in-the-loop validation versus automated LLM judging involves accuracy versus scalability tradeoffs.

**Failure Signatures**: Low normalized bi-semantic entropy with high emotional valence may indicate superficially pleasing but semantically fragile solutions. High variance in emotional valence across personas suggests solutions that appeal to some users but alienate others. Thresholds set too high may reject useful solutions; thresholds too low may accept inadequate ones.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement the toy model with different LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) to test framework robustness
2. Validate emotional valence measurements by comparing LLM-judge scores with human evaluator panels on sample problems
3. Test normalized bi-semantic entropy correlation with solution reliability by varying problem formulations and measuring output consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can LLM-as-a-Judge architectures reliably operationalize the multi-dimensional trust index Q at scale across diverse problem domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Developing scalable methodologies for measuring and operationalizing the trust index Q, potentially through advanced LLM-as-a-Judge architectures."
- Why unresolved: Only a toy model with simplified scenarios is demonstrated; no large-scale empirical validation exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing LLM-judge computed Q values against human evaluator panels across multiple domains with statistical correlation analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What threshold values (q̂k, v̂k) define "good enough" for specific real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper asks "how to set threshold values" and proposes iterative human-in-the-loop validation (Algorithm 1), but acknowledges this is costly and domain-dependent without providing validated thresholds.
- Why unresolved: Threshold determination requires domain-specific human validation which the paper does not implement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation studies in domains such as medical, legal, or educational applications establishing validated threshold pairs correlated with actual user satisfaction outcomes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do LLM-based persona evaluators accurately approximate human emotional valence judgments across diverse use cases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper warns "not to overly rely on this methodology without justifying it given the use case" and states they "do not attempt an explicit alignment study."
- Why unresolved: Supporting literature is cited, but systematic alignment verification methodology is not established.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring correlation between human and LLM-persona emotional valence scores across diverse problem types and user demographics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does normalized bi-semantic entropy predict LLM solution reliability or user satisfaction in production deployments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Empirically evaluating the proposed quality metrics in practical deployments."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates NSE computation only in toy examples without linking it to downstream quality outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies correlating NSE values with independent quality measures in production systems, showing whether entropy levels predict task success or user satisfaction.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation beyond a single toy model example without comprehensive testing across diverse problem domains
- Framework's practical utility for real-world applications remains to be demonstrated through systematic evaluation
- No established threshold values for quality dimensions across different application domains

## Confidence
- **Theoretical Framework**: High - mathematical foundations are sound and well-developed
- **Quality Dimension Definitions**: Medium - concepts are clearly defined but practical implementation details need validation
- **Empirical Validation**: Low - limited to toy model without systematic testing across problem domains
- **Framework Generalizability**: Medium - theoretical framework appears sound but needs empirical testing across different LLM architectures and problem types

## Next Checks
1. Systematic evaluation of the framework across multiple problem domains (mathematical, logical, creative) to test generalizability
2. Replication of the toy model with different LLM architectures and prompting strategies to verify robustness
3. Empirical validation of the proposed quality dimensions against human judgment benchmarks in controlled studies
