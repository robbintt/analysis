# A new kid on the block: Distributional semantics predicts the word-specific tone signatures of monosyllabic words in conversational Taiwan Mandarin

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17337
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17337
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Word-specific pitch contours in conversational Taiwan Mandarin can be predicted from contextualized embeddings, with accuracy exceeding permutation baseline

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. The researchers used generalized additive models to decompose observed pitch contours into component contours tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. They found that even when controlling for word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline.

## Method Summary
The study analyzed 6,120 tokens of 95 word types from a Taiwan Mandarin spontaneous speech corpus. Researchers extracted F0 contours using Praat, normalized time to [0,1], and applied log transformation. They used generalized additive models with factor smooths to decompose pitch contours into components tied to predictors (gender, vowel, duration, tone sequence, utterance position, word identity, word sense). For distributional semantics analysis, they extracted contextualized embeddings using Chinese GPT-2, represented pitch contours as 100-dimensional vectors via GAM smoothing, and trained linear mappings from embeddings to pitch contours. Model performance was evaluated using AIC comparisons, cross-validation, and prediction accuracy against permutation baselines.

## Key Results
- Word identity predicts pitch contours beyond canonical tone patterns and controlled prosodic factors
- Heterographic homophones (e.g., 你/妳, 不/部, 地/的/得) show distinct pitch contours despite identical segments and canonical tones
- Contextualized embeddings predict word-specific pitch contours with 10.2% accuracy, substantially exceeding the 2.1% permutation baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Word meaning, operationalized via contextualized embeddings, co-determines pitch contour realization in spontaneous Mandarin speech.
- Mechanism: Semantic vectors from distributional models (GPT-2) encode context-specific meaning; these vectors map to pitch contours through learned linear transformations. The embedding captures fine-grained semantic distinctions that correlate with systematic pitch variation.
- Core assumption: Contextualized embeddings provide a meaningful proxy for speakers' semantic representations during production.
- Evidence anchors: pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline; DLM achieves 10.2% testing accuracy (vs. 3.4% majority baseline and 2.1% permutation baseline); Weak direct corpus evidence; the relationship is inferred through model performance, not independently verified neural or behavioral data
- Break condition: If embeddings primarily capture syntactic rather than semantic structure, the mechanism may reflect syntactic-prosodic rather than semantic-prosodic coupling.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Word identity and word sense capture pitch variation beyond canonical tone categories, even after controlling for articulatory and prosodic factors.
- Mechanism: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) decompose observed F0 contours into additive components tied to predictors (speaker, duration, tone sequence, word, word sense). Factor smooths for word-by-time interactions reveal word-specific pitch signatures.
- Core assumption: The statistical decomposition validly isolates semantic effects from confounds; collinearity between word and segmental properties is partially addressable through heterographic homophone comparisons.
- Evidence anchors: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours; Heterographic homophones show distinct pitch contours despite identical segments and canonical tones; Word sense model improves AIC by 4711 units over baseline; Cross-validation shows word model outperforms word sense model on held-out data, suggesting overfitting risk for sense-level predictions
- Break condition: If word-specific effects are confounded with syntactic constructions, the mechanism may partially reflect construction-specific prosody rather than pure semantics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) framework—linear mappings between meaning and form vectors—provides a computational account of semantic-phonetic alignment.
- Mechanism: Production mapping (meaning → form) is learned through experience. Pitch contours are represented as 100-dimensional vectors (GAM-smoothed F0 at normalized time points). Linear regression maps 768-dimensional embeddings to pitch vectors.
- Core assumption: The mapping is approximately linear; semantic and phonetic spaces align through discriminative learning without intermediate symbolic representations.
- Evidence anchors: Linear mapping from embeddings to GAM-denoised pitch contours achieves above-chance accuracy; GAM-identified word pitch contours visually match DLM-predicted contours from embedding centroids; No independent corpus evidence; DLM is a theoretical framework instantiated here, not tested against alternative architectures
- Break condition: If semantic-phonetic mapping requires non-linear transformations or intermediate phonological representations, the linear DLM account is incomplete.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with factor smooths**
  - Why needed here: Core statistical method for decomposing time-varying pitch contours into predictor-specific components while handling autocorrelation and non-linearity.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a factor smooth (bs="fs") differs from a by-variable smooth, and why the former was chosen for speaker effects?

- **Concept: Contextualized embeddings (transformer-derived)**
  - Why needed here: Proxy for token-level semantic representation; used both for sense disambiguation and as DLM input features.
  - Quick check question: How does a contextualized embedding for a word token differ from a static word embedding, and what information does it encode beyond word identity?

- **Concept: Mandarin tone categories and co-articulation**
  - Why needed here: Baseline phonological framework; the paper challenges canonical tone realization while using tone sequence as a control variable.
  - Quick check question: What are the five canonical Mandarin tones, and how does tonal co-articulation affect their surface realization in connected speech?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Raw speech corpus (Taiwan Mandarin) -> Forced alignment (MFA) -> Vowel boundary detection -> F0 extraction (Praat, 5ms intervals) -> Log transformation -> Time-normalized pitch contours (0-1 interval) -> GAM decomposition (control vars + word/word sense smooths) -> Word-specific contour viz and 100-dim pitch vectors -> Contextualized embeddings (GPT-2) -> DLM linear mapping (train/test split) -> Prediction accuracy vs. baselines

- **Critical path:**
  1. Forced alignment quality—boundary errors propagate to F0 extraction
  2. Sense disambiguation accuracy—errors in sense labels directly affect word sense GAM
  3. Embedding quality for low-frequency tokens—sparse contextual support reduces embedding reliability

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Word vs. word sense as predictor: Word sense provides better fit (ΔAIC 4711) but worse cross-validation accuracy; sense labeling is approximate, and sparse senses reduce trainability
  - GAM denoising level: More predictors → cleaner pitch vectors → better DLM prediction, but risks circularity (using word info to denoise, then predicting from semantics)
  - Permutation vs. majority baseline: Permutation baseline (2.1%) is stricter than majority (3.4%); choice affects interpretation of "substantially exceeds"

- **Failure signatures:**
  - GAM fails to converge: high concurvity between duration, speech rate, and utterance position
  - DLM prediction at chance: embeddings may lack semantic signal for task
  - Homophone contours identical: semantic effect absent or overwhelmed by other factors
  - Cross-validation accuracy drops sharply: overfitting to training data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate GAM decomposition on a held-out subset: Train baseline + word GAM on 80% of data, test whether word smooths remain significant on 20% held-out; verify that AIC improvements generalize
  2. Ablate embedding dimensions: Randomly mask 50% of embedding dimensions before DLM training; test whether prediction accuracy drops proportionally, confirming that semantic signal is distributed
  3. Test on Beijing Mandarin corpus (if available): Apply identical pipeline to a different Mandarin variety; assess whether word-specific pitch signatures generalize or are variety-specific

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do word-specific tonal signatures interact with fine-grained prosodic indicators, such as sentence position and word category?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in Section 3.2 that the dataset was "too sparse to allow for systematic exploration of interactions of normalized time by word by sentence position" and explicitly leave the "exploration of interactions of sentence position, more fine-grained indicators of prosody, and word category, to follow-up research."
- Why unresolved: The current corpus data lacked sufficient density to model the complex three-way interactions between time, specific words, and prosodic context without risking overfitting or statistical sparsity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study utilizing a denser corpus or targeted experiments that allows for the statistical modeling of the interaction between word identity, time, and phrasal prosody.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do word-specific tonal realizations and the influence of semantics on pitch exist in careful or formal speech registers?
- Basis in paper: The authors note on page 26 that canonical tones might be correct for "careful speech (Lai and Zhang, 2008)," and while they "anticipate that word-specific tonal realizations can also be observed here," this remains untested as the study focuses on spontaneous conversation.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to spontaneous conversational Taiwan Mandarin; the authors indicate that the divergence from textbook descriptions may be due to register differences, but they do not test formal registers.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis applying the same GAM and distributional semantic methods to a corpus of careful or laboratory speech to see if word-specific effects persist alongside canonical tone patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do listeners actually perceive and utilize these word-specific pitch contours for lexical identification?
- Basis in paper: The authors argue that the pitch differences observed are "larger than just noticeable differences" and are therefore "in principle... perceivable" and "learnable." However, the study is entirely acoustic and computational, inferring perceptual relevance without behavioral testing.
- Why unresolved: Demonstrating that a machine learning model (DLM) can predict contours from embeddings does not prove that human listeners use these contours to distinguish words in real-time comprehension.
- What evidence would resolve it: Perceptual identification experiments where listeners are asked to identify words based on manipulated pitch contours, or eye-tracking studies to see if semantically appropriate pitch contours facilitate lexical access.

## Limitations

- Corpus access: The core analysis depends on a Taiwan Mandarin spontaneous speech corpus that is not publicly available, limiting independent verification
- Semantic proxy validity: The study uses GPT-2 contextualized embeddings as a proxy for speakers' semantic representations, but these may capture syntactic rather than semantic information
- Word sense quality: The word sense model relies on automated WSD with Chinese WordNet and BERT embeddings, but word sense boundaries in Chinese are inherently fuzzy and system accuracy is not reported

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that word identity predicts pitch contours beyond canonical tone patterns and controlled prosodic factors. This is supported by multiple converging analyses including GAM model comparisons, heterographic homophone analysis, and cross-validation.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that word sense predicts pitch contours better than word identity. While the word sense GAM achieves substantially better AIC than the word model, cross-validation shows the word model actually performs better on held-out data, suggesting the sense model may be overfitting.

**Low Confidence**: The specific causal claim that differences in contextualized meaning directly cause word-specific pitch signatures. The correlational evidence is strong, but without experimental manipulation of meaning or independent verification that embeddings capture production-relevant semantic representations, we cannot rule out alternative explanations.

## Next Checks

1. Test DLM prediction on embeddings from a different model: Train and evaluate the DLM using embeddings from BERT-base-Chinese or another transformer architecture to help isolate semantic effects from model-specific artifacts.

2. Replicate core findings on an independent Mandarin corpus: Apply the complete pipeline to a different Mandarin speech corpus (e.g., Beijing Mandarin or another Taiwan Mandarin dataset) to strengthen claims of generality.

3. Conduct an ablation study on predictor variables: Systematically remove each control variable from the GAM and assess impact on word effect significance and DLM prediction accuracy to quantify the unique contribution of semantics.
