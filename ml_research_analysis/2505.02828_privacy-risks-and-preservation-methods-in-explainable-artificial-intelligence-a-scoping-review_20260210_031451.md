# Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.02828
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828
- Reference count: 40
- Authors identify two main categories of privacy threats in XAI: intentional attacks and unintentional leaks

## Executive Summary
This scoping review comprehensively analyzes privacy risks in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems, revealing how explanations intended to enhance transparency can inadvertently expose sensitive information. The authors systematically categorize privacy threats into intentional attacks (membership inference, model inversion, model extraction) and unintentional leaks (training issues, explanation content), examining 57 studies to identify patterns and preservation methods. The research demonstrates that privacy in XAI cannot be an afterthought but must be integrated from the design phase, as the very act of making AI systems explainable creates new attack surfaces that traditional privacy preservation methods may not address.

The study proposes ten essential characteristics for privacy-preserving XAI systems and evaluates various preservation methods including differential privacy, anonymization, cryptography, and federated learning. Through practical use cases across domains like healthcare and finance, the authors illustrate how explanations can reveal sensitive patterns while maintaining system effectiveness. The findings emphasize the critical need to balance the three pillars of XAI - privacy, explainability, and utility - while providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners developing privacy-safe XAI solutions.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive scoping review examining 57 studies on privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI systems. They systematically categorized identified threats into two main groups: intentional attacks (membership inference, model inversion, model extraction) and unintentional leaks (training issues, explanation content). The review evaluated various privacy preservation methods including differential privacy, anonymization, cryptography, and federated learning, while proposing ten characteristics for privacy-preserving XAI systems. The analysis drew from peer-reviewed literature across multiple domains, with practical use cases demonstrating how explanations can inadvertently expose sensitive information.

## Key Results
- XAI systems face two main categories of privacy threats: intentional attacks and unintentional leaks
- Privacy preservation methods must balance explainability, utility, and privacy simultaneously
- Privacy must be integrated as a fundamental design requirement from the initial development phase

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study works by systematically identifying and categorizing privacy threats in XAI systems, then evaluating preservation methods against these threats. The mechanism relies on understanding that explanations create new attack surfaces while providing transparency. By proposing ten characteristics for privacy-preserving XAI and demonstrating practical use cases, the authors create a framework for balancing competing requirements. The scoping review methodology allows for comprehensive coverage of existing literature while identifying gaps and emerging threats.

## Foundational Learning
1. **XAI Privacy Threat Landscape**: Understanding the distinction between intentional attacks (membership inference, model inversion, model extraction) and unintentional leaks (training issues, explanation content) is crucial for developing appropriate preservation strategies.
   - Why needed: Different attack types require different defense mechanisms
   - Quick check: Can you categorize a given privacy threat as intentional or unintentional?

2. **Differential Privacy in XAI**: Adding calibrated noise to explanations or training data to protect individual privacy while maintaining aggregate utility.
   - Why needed: Provides mathematical guarantees for privacy preservation
   - Quick check: Does the noise addition preserve explanation quality while protecting individual data points?

3. **Privacy-Explainability-Utility Triangle**: The fundamental trade-off between providing meaningful explanations, protecting privacy, and maintaining system performance.
   - Why needed: Guides design decisions and resource allocation
   - Quick check: Can you identify which two elements are prioritized when the third is compromised?

4. **Federated Learning for XAI**: Decentralized training approach that keeps data local while aggregating model updates.
   - Why needed: Prevents raw data exposure during training
   - Quick check: Does the federated approach maintain explanation quality across distributed datasets?

5. **Cryptographic Preservation Methods**: Using encryption and secure computation to protect sensitive information in explanations.
   - Why needed: Provides strong mathematical guarantees for data protection
- Quick check: Are the cryptographic operations computationally feasible for real-time explanations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Source -> Model Training -> Explanation Generation -> Privacy Preservation -> Output Interface

**Critical Path:**
Model Training -> Explanation Generation -> Privacy Preservation -> Output Interface
(Privacy preservation must occur before explanation delivery to prevent data exposure)

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. Privacy: Higher privacy preservation typically reduces explanation quality
- Computational Overhead vs. Security: Stronger cryptographic methods increase processing time
- Granularity vs. Protection: More detailed explanations provide better transparency but increase privacy risks
- Centralized vs. Federated: Centralized systems offer better control but higher privacy risks

**Failure Signatures:**
- Explanation leakage despite preservation methods
- Significant performance degradation after privacy protection
- User inability to understand overly-sanitized explanations
- System crashes during cryptographic operations

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test membership inference attacks on baseline XAI system without preservation
2. Implement differential privacy on explanations and measure utility loss
3. Compare federated learning approach against centralized training for explanation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scoping methodology may have missed emerging privacy threats not yet documented in peer-reviewed literature
- Categorization of privacy risks into intentional and unintentional attacks may oversimplify complex attack vectors
- Effectiveness assessment of preservation methods relies on reported metrics that may vary based on implementation details

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The identification of two main categories of privacy threats and the core principle that privacy must be integrated from design phase
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed ten characteristics for privacy-preserving XAI systems
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness assessment of specific preservation methods

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical validation of the proposed ten characteristics through implementation in real-world XAI systems across different domains
2. Test the identified privacy preservation methods against emerging attack vectors not covered in current literature
3. Perform a comparative analysis of the trade-offs between privacy, explainability, and utility across different application domains using standardized benchmarks
