# Parameter-Free Federated TD Learning with Markov Noise in Heterogeneous Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.07436
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07436
- **Authors**: Ankur Naskar; Gugan Thoppe; Utsav Negi; Vijay Gupta
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary Result**: Parameter-free federated TD learning algorithm achieving optimal $\tilde{O}(1/(NT))$ convergence rates for Markovian data in heterogeneous environments without requiring problem-specific step sizes

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates in federated temporal difference (TD) learning for Markovian data in heterogeneous environments. While federated learning can accelerate reinforcement learning by distributing exploration and training across multiple agents, existing methods achieving optimal convergence rates rely on unknown problem parameters, particularly in the presence of Markovian noise. The authors propose a two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert averaging that provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/(NT))$ convergence rate in both average-reward and discounted settings without requiring problem-specific step sizes. Their approach applies to both single-agent and federated scenarios with heterogeneous MDPs.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm uses a two-timescale approach where the value function estimate is updated on a faster timescale using a universal step size, while the average reward estimate is updated on a slower timescale. This is combined with Polyak-Ruppert averaging to achieve optimal convergence rates without knowledge of problem parameters like minimum eigenvalues of transition-related matrices. The algorithm is designed to work with Markovian data and handles heterogeneous environments where different agents may have different Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The key innovation lies in the separation of timescales and the use of universal step sizes, which allows the algorithm to achieve optimal rates without requiring knowledge of specific problem parameters.

## Key Results
- Achieves optimal $\tilde{O}(1/(NT))$ convergence rate for both average-reward and discounted TD learning in heterogeneous federated settings
- Eliminates the need for problem-specific step sizes, making the algorithm truly parameter-free
- Demonstrates that the heterogeneity gap vanishes as environment differences decrease
- Shows comparable performance to existing methods that depend on unknown problem parameters through numerical simulations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by leveraging a two-timescale stochastic approximation framework. The faster timescale updates for the value function allow for quick adaptation to local environment characteristics, while the slower timescale updates for the average reward provide stability and convergence guarantees. The Polyak-Ruppert averaging further smooths the estimates and improves convergence rates. The universal step size selection avoids the need to tune parameters based on problem-specific quantities like minimum eigenvalues, which are typically unknown in practice.

3. **Federated Learning**: Why needed - Framework for distributed training across multiple agents; Quick check - Can you explain how federated averaging works?
4. **Two-timescale Stochastic Approximation**: Why needed - Mathematical framework for analyzing algorithms with updates at different speeds; Quick check - Do you understand the stability conditions for two-timescale algorithms?
5. **Polyak-Ruppert Averaging**: Why needed - Technique for improving convergence rates in stochastic approximation; Quick check - Can you explain how averaging helps reduce variance in stochastic algorithms?
6. **Heterogeneous Environments**: Why needed - Real-world scenario where different agents experience different dynamics; Quick check - Can you describe how heterogeneity affects convergence in distributed learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment simulators -> Local TD learners (fast timescale) -> Global aggregator -> Average reward updater (slow timescale) -> Value function estimator

**Critical Path**: State sampling → Local TD update → Communication to server → Aggregation → Slow timescale average reward update → Value function refinement

**Design Tradeoffs**: Parameter-free operation vs. potential slower initial convergence compared to tuned methods; simplicity of implementation vs. potentially suboptimal performance in highly heterogeneous environments

**Failure Signatures**: Divergence when Markov chain mixing is too slow; Poor performance when heterogeneity is extreme; Instability when communication is unreliable or delayed

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Single-agent TD learning with known optimal parameters for baseline comparison
2. Federated TD learning with identical MDPs across agents (homogeneous case)
3. Federated TD learning with varying degrees of MDP heterogeneity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Analysis assumes bounded variance and smooth mixing conditions for Markov chains, which may not hold in all practical scenarios
- The heterogeneity gap, while shown to vanish as environments become similar, is not quantified in terms of specific MDP differences
- The paper focuses on tabular settings without addressing function approximation, limiting applicability to large-scale problems
- Experimental validation is limited to relatively simple environments without extensive comparison to alternative parameter-free methods

## Confidence

**High**: Theoretical convergence rates (O(1/(NT))) and their optimality in the considered settings

**Medium**: Parameter-free nature of the algorithm and its practical implementation

**Medium**: Numerical simulations confirming theoretical findings

## Next Checks

1. Test the algorithm's performance under varying degrees of environment heterogeneity to empirically measure the heterogeneity gap
2. Extend experiments to function approximation settings (e.g., linear function approximation) to assess practical scalability
3. Compare against other parameter-free RL methods beyond the specific baselines mentioned to establish relative performance in heterogeneous federated settings
