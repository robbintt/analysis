# ScreenSpot-Pro: GUI Grounding for Professional High-Resolution Computer Use

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07981
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07981
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: ScreenSeekeR boosts OS-Atlas-7B's GUI grounding accuracy from 18.9% to 48.1% on professional high-resolution applications

## Executive Summary
ScreenSpot-Pro introduces a novel benchmark for evaluating GUI grounding in high-resolution professional environments, addressing the challenges of small target sizes and complex interfaces that existing models struggle with. The benchmark is built on authentic screenshots from 23 professional applications across five industries, providing a rigorous test bed for GUI grounding in real-world scenarios. The authors propose ScreenSeekeR, an agentic framework that leverages iterative visual search refinement guided by a planner's GUI knowledge to improve accuracy in locating interactive elements.

## Method Summary
The study introduces ScreenSpot-Pro, a benchmark designed to evaluate GUI grounding in high-resolution professional environments. The benchmark addresses the limitations of existing models in handling small target sizes and complex interfaces by providing a dataset of authentic screenshots from 23 professional applications across five industries. ScreenSeekeR, the proposed solution, is an agentic framework that employs a planner to guide iterative visual search, reducing the search area and improving accuracy. The framework is tested against existing models, demonstrating significant performance improvements without additional training.

## Key Results
- ScreenSeekeR significantly outperforms existing models, boosting OS-Atlas-7B's accuracy from 18.9% to 48.1%
- The benchmark highlights challenges in icon grounding and multilingual contexts
- ScreenSeekeR demonstrates effectiveness in professional settings with high-resolution screenshots

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ScreenSeekeR's effectiveness stems from its iterative visual search refinement guided by a planner's GUI knowledge. By reducing the search area and focusing on relevant GUI elements, the framework improves accuracy in locating interactive elements. This approach addresses the challenges of small target sizes and complex interfaces in professional high-resolution environments, where traditional models often struggle.

## Foundational Learning
1. **GUI Grounding**: Understanding the interaction between GUI elements and their visual representation. Why needed: Essential for accurately locating interactive elements in complex interfaces. Quick check: Can the model correctly identify and locate GUI elements in a given screenshot?
2. **Iterative Refinement**: The process of continuously improving search results by narrowing down the search area. Why needed: Enhances accuracy by focusing on relevant elements. Quick check: Does the model's accuracy improve with each iteration?
3. **Multilingual Contexts**: Handling GUI elements that may contain text in different languages. Why needed: Professional environments often use diverse languages. Quick check: Can the model correctly interpret GUI elements with multilingual text?
4. **High-Resolution Processing**: Managing and interpreting high-resolution screenshots effectively. Why needed: Professional environments often use high-resolution displays. Quick check: Does the model maintain accuracy with high-resolution inputs?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Planner -> Visual Search -> Iterative Refinement
**Critical Path**: The planner analyzes the GUI structure and guides the visual search, which iteratively refines the search area to locate interactive elements accurately.
**Design Tradeoffs**: The iterative approach increases accuracy but may require more computational resources. Balancing precision with efficiency is crucial for real-time applications.
**Failure Signatures**: Inaccurate GUI element detection, misinterpretation of multilingual text, and failure to adapt to novel GUI layouts.
**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test ScreenSeekeR's performance on a subset of the benchmark with known ground truth to validate accuracy improvements.
2. Evaluate the model's adaptability by introducing slight variations in GUI layouts and measuring performance changes.
3. Conduct a user study to compare ScreenSeekeR's grounding accuracy with human performance in realistic professional scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on professional desktop applications may limit generalizability to mobile or web-based platforms.
- Benchmark emphasizes specific applications across five industries, potentially limiting applicability to other professional contexts.
- Performance gains demonstrated primarily through controlled comparisons, raising questions about real-world robustness.

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The benchmark construction methodology and systematic evaluation framework are sound, with statistically significant performance improvements.
**Medium confidence**: The generalizability of ScreenSeekeR's performance to real-world professional environments beyond tested applications remains to be fully established.
**Low confidence**: The benchmark may not fully capture all critical challenges of professional GUI grounding, particularly temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study evaluating ScreenSeekeR's performance across different versions of the same professional applications over time.
2. Implement cross-domain validation by testing the model on GUI grounding tasks in non-professional software environments.
3. Design a user study comparing ScreenSeekeR's grounding accuracy with human performance in realistic professional scenarios.
