# Benchmark Datasets for Lead-Lag Forecasting on Social Platforms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.03877
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03877
- Reference count: 21
- Introduces lead-lag forecasting (LLF) with two large-scale benchmark datasets for cross-channel and cross-series generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) as a novel forecasting paradigm to predict future outcomes (lag) from early signals (lead) across different channels, motivated by ubiquitous patterns in social platforms. The authors present two large-scale benchmark datasets—arXiv (2.3M papers, accesses→citations) and GitHub (3M repositories, pushes/stars→forks)—designed for cross-channel and cross-series generalization, capturing long-horizon dynamics over years without survivorship bias. They validate lead-lag dynamics through correlation analysis and classification experiments, showing predictive signals from early access/pushes to future citations/forks. Baseline experiments on regression tasks using parametric and non-parametric methods demonstrate that even simple models achieve reasonable performance, with more complex models improving accuracy, especially for high-impact cases. These datasets and results lay an empirical foundation for advancing LLF research in social and usage data.

## Method Summary
The authors construct two large-scale benchmark datasets for lead-lag forecasting: arXiv (2.3M papers) and GitHub (3M repositories). These datasets capture cross-channel and cross-series generalization, tracking long-horizon dynamics over years. Lead-lag dynamics are validated through correlation analysis and classification experiments. The arXiv dataset maps paper accesses to future citations, while the GitHub dataset maps repository pushes and stars to future forks. Baseline regression experiments use both parametric (linear models) and non-parametric (kNN, decision trees) methods, demonstrating that lead-lag patterns are predictive of future outcomes. The datasets are designed to avoid survivorship bias by including complete time series data.

## Key Results
- Lead-lag patterns are empirically validated as predictive of future outcomes through correlation analysis and classification experiments
- Baseline models, including simple parametric and non-parametric methods, achieve reasonable performance in regression tasks
- More complex models improve accuracy, particularly for high-impact cases, demonstrating the feasibility of LLF

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The lead-lag forecasting paradigm works by capturing early signals (lead) from one channel that can predict future outcomes (lag) on another channel. The mechanism relies on temporal dependencies and cross-channel relationships that emerge naturally in social platforms. Early accesses to academic papers and repository interactions on GitHub create measurable patterns that correlate with future citations and forks, respectively. These relationships persist over long time horizons, making them suitable for forecasting tasks. The cross-channel nature allows models to leverage diverse signals that may not be apparent within a single channel.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-channel generalization**: Understanding how signals from one domain can predict outcomes in another - needed to capture the full spectrum of lead-lag relationships
- **Long-horizon forecasting**: Working with time series spanning years rather than days or weeks - needed to capture meaningful patterns in social platform evolution
- **Survivorship bias mitigation**: Ensuring complete time series data is included rather than only successful cases - needed for representative and unbiased training
- **Temporal correlation analysis**: Identifying meaningful lead-lag relationships through statistical methods - needed to validate the existence of predictive patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Correlation Analysis -> Classification Validation -> Regression Baseline Experiments

**Critical Path**: The essential pipeline flows from raw data collection through preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, temporal alignment), to statistical validation of lead-lag relationships, followed by empirical validation through classification experiments, and finally regression baseline experiments to establish performance benchmarks.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The datasets prioritize long-horizon dynamics and cross-channel generalization over immediate predictive accuracy. This choice favors comprehensive understanding of temporal patterns but may sacrifice short-term forecasting precision. The inclusion of complete time series data addresses survivorship bias but increases computational complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate either weak lead-lag relationships in the data or inadequate model capacity to capture complex temporal dependencies. Extremely high correlation values could suggest data leakage or overly simplistic relationships that may not generalize.

**First Experiments**:
1. Conduct correlation analysis between lead and lag variables across different time lags to identify optimal forecasting horizons
2. Perform classification experiments to validate whether early signals can distinguish between high and low future outcomes
3. Train and evaluate simple parametric models (linear regression) as baseline performance benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The datasets are limited to two specific social platforms (arXiv and GitHub), potentially restricting generalizability to other domains
- The paper does not thoroughly explore the impact of different lead-lag intervals on predictive performance
- Limited discussion of potential confounders such as external events that might influence observed lead-lag patterns

## Confidence

**High**: The datasets are well-constructed and free from survivorship bias; the observed lead-lag dynamics are empirically validated through correlation analysis and classification experiments.

**Medium**: Baseline experiments demonstrate the feasibility of LLF, but the generalizability to other domains and the robustness of the methods require further investigation through additional validation on diverse platforms.

**Low**: The paper does not fully address potential confounders or the impact of varying lead-lag intervals on predictive performance, which could affect the reliability of the forecasting paradigm in real-world applications.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different lead-lag intervals on predictive accuracy across datasets
2. Evaluate the datasets on additional social platforms or domains to test generalizability beyond arXiv and GitHub
3. Investigate the influence of external events or confounders on the observed lead-lag dynamics to ensure robustness of the findings
