# Emergent World Representations in OpenVLA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24559
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24559
- Authors: Marco Molinari; Leonardo Nevali; Saharsha Navani; Omar G. Younis
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Probes trained on internal activations consistently outperform those trained on raw embeddings, with statistically significant R² values across all LIBERO dataset sections and time horizons (K=1,3,10,30).

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art vision-language-action model trained with policy-based reinforcement learning, implicitly learns a world model. The authors use embedding arithmetic to study whether the model's internal activations contain predictive knowledge of state transitions, and train both linear and MLP probes to predict state transition vectors from model activations. The results show that probes trained on internal activations consistently outperform those trained on raw embeddings, with statistically significant R² values across all LIBERO dataset sections and time horizons (K=1,3,10,30). The world model emerges most strongly in middle layers, and scaling pre-training improves predictive ability compared to early checkpoints and fine-tuned models. Linear probes outperform MLPs, supporting interpretable representations.

## Method Summary
The paper extracts activations from OpenVLA's residual stream at layers 7, 15, 22, and 30 while processing LIBERO episodes. State transition vectors (Δe_{t→t+K} = e_{t+K} - e_t) are computed using mean-pooled CLIP embeddings of current and future frames. Both Lasso linear probes and 2-layer MLPs are trained to predict these transition vectors from activations, with performance measured by R². The study compares probe performance on activations versus raw embeddings, across different layers, and between pre-trained versus fine-tuned models. Statistical significance is established through permutation tests (100 shuffles) and one-way tests comparing R² scores.

## Key Results
- Linear probes on activations achieve R² values significantly higher than baseline probes on raw embeddings across all LIBERO sections and time horizons (K=1,3,10,30)
- Knowledge of state transitions is best probed from middle layers (15-22) of OpenVLA
- Pre-trained models show better world model emergence than fine-tuned models on LIBERO
- Linear probes consistently outperform MLP probes (87.5% wins), suggesting interpretable representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Policy-based reinforcement learning implicitly induces a world model as a byproduct of learning to act. To optimize a policy for action generation, the model benefits from predicting the consequence of actions. The paper argues that the "closed-loop" dynamics of an optimal policy can be approximated by a Koopman operator acting on the embedding space. As the model scales, it learns to represent this operator (state transition function) linearly in its activations to improve action selection, even without explicit dynamics supervision.

### Mechanism 2
The world model is represented linearly in the residual stream of middle layers. Information in transformer residual streams is often linearly encoded. The authors find that linear probes outperform MLP probes (87.5% wins), suggesting the state transition vector (Δe_{t→t+K}) is stored as a linear direction in activation space rather than a complex non-manifold. Middle layers (15-22) balance raw perception (early layers) and action output (late layers).

### Mechanism 3
Pre-training diversity and scale are prerequisites for the emergence of a robust world model. Exposure to massive, diverse datasets (Open X-Embodiment) forces the model to generalize dynamics rather than overfitting to specific visual features. Fine-tuning on narrow tasks (LIBERO) may actually degrade this general capability ("catastrophic forgetting" of the world model) as the model shifts to rote policy imitation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Residual Stream & Activation Probing
  - **Why needed here**: The paper extracts "activations a_t" from the residual stream to find the world model. Understanding that the residual stream is a linear sum of previous layer outputs is crucial to understanding why linear probes work.
  - **Quick check question**: If I intervene on the residual stream in layer 15, should I expect the output logits to change linearly or non-linearly?

- **Concept**: Koopman Operator Theory
  - **Why needed here**: The paper uses this to theoretically justify looking for *linear* dynamics in a non-linear system. It bridges the gap between complex robot motion and the linear probes used to detect it.
  - **Quick check question**: Does the Koopman operator allow us to model non-linear dynamics using linear tools in a higher-dimensional space?

- **Concept**: State Transition Vectors (Δe)
  - **Why needed here**: This is the specific "label" the model predicts. It represents the change in the environment (embedding e_{t+K} minus e_t) rather than the raw future state.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is predicting the *difference* vector (Δe) statistically more rigorous than predicting the future state e_{t+K} directly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Vision (CLIP embeddings) + Text (Tokenized) → OpenVLA (7B Param Transformer) → Residual Stream Activations (Layers 7, 15, 22, 30) → Probes (Lasso Linear or 2-layer MLP) → Predicted Transition Vector

- **Critical path**: 1) Load OpenVLA and run inference on LIBERO episodes; 2) Hook into residual stream to extract a_t at layers 7, 15, 22, 30; 3) Compute "Ground Truth" Δe using CLIP embeddings of current and future frames; 4) Train probes to map a_t → Δe

- **Design tradeoffs**: Linear vs. MLP Probes: Linear is chosen here for interpretability and alignment with the Linear Representation Hypothesis, even if MLPs might squeeze out slightly more R² in other contexts (though here Linear wins). Mean Pooling: The paper averages patch embeddings, losing spatial localization. This simplifies the vector math but makes it impossible to say *where* in the image a change occurs.

- **Failure signatures**: High R² on embeddings (Baseline) but low on activations: The probe is just memorizing visual similarity, and the model has no internal dynamics. Fine-tuned models outperforming Pre-trained on R²: The model is overfitting to the specific test set dynamics rather than learning general physics. Noise Dominance at K=1: If Allan Variance analysis shows noise at K=1, the "world model" might just be detecting high-level task completion rather than fine-grained physics.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Layer Sweep: Train linear probes on layers 0 through 32 to verify the "Middle Layer" peak (Section 4.5) on a held-out LIBERO task; 2) Baseline Sanity Check: Train a probe to predict e_{t+K} directly vs. Δe. Verify that predicting the difference yields statistically significant p-values (< 0.01) while raw prediction might just reflect correlation; 3) Intervention Test (Advanced): If a probe successfully predicts a transition (e.g., "mug moves right"), intervene on the activation vector by subtracting the predicted transition direction and verify if the policy's action changes correspondingly (causal testing).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the emergent world model be effectively probed at the patch level to enable localized interventions, rather than relying on mean-pooled activations?
- Can Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) successfully decompose the latent world model into interpretable features suitable for the proposed planning and veto pipeline?
- Is the latent world model causally utilized by the policy for planning, or is it merely an epiphenomenon available for probing but not influencing action selection?

## Limitations

- Spatial Localization Gap: Mean-pooling CLIP embeddings loses spatial information about where changes occur in the image
- Temporal Granularity Constraint: 5Hz sampling rate with K values up to 30 steps may miss fine-grained dynamics
- Dataset Specificity: LIBERO is a synthetic dataset of tabletop robot manipulation, limiting generalizability to unstructured real-world environments

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Statistical comparison between linear probes on activations vs. embeddings (R² significantly higher, permutation tests p < 0.01)
- Medium Confidence: Claim that middle layers (15-22) best capture world model knowledge
- Medium Confidence: Superiority of pre-training over fine-tuning for world model emergence

## Next Checks

1. **Spatial Resolution Test**: Replace mean-pooling with attention-weighted pooling or region-based embeddings to preserve spatial information. Train probes on localized change vectors and compare R² scores to assess the spatial localization gap.

2. **Temporal Granularity Sweep**: Repeat experiments with K ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20} and evaluate Allan Variance to quantify the noise floor. This will clarify whether the world model captures fine-grained dynamics or only high-level task completion.

3. **Real-World Generalization Test**: Apply the same probing methodology to a real-world robot dataset (e.g., RoboNet or REAL2) with natural scene variation. This will validate whether the emergent world model transfers beyond synthetic tabletop environments.
