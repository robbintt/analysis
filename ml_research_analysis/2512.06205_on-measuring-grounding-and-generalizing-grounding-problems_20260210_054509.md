# On measuring grounding and generalizing grounding problems

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06205

- Primary result: Operationalizes symbol grounding via five desiderata audit framework with evaluation tuples

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a framework for measuring grounding that replaces binary judgments with profiled evaluations across five desiderata: authenticity, preservation, faithfulness (correlational and etiological), robustness, and compositionality. Each desideratum is indexed by an evaluation tuple specifying context, meaning type, threat model, and reference distribution. The framework introduces a grounding profile that quantifies semantic alignment and causal warrant, applied to model-theoretic semantics, LLMs, and natural language to show systematic differences in grounding capabilities.

## Method Summary
The method operationalizes grounding through a five-desiderata framework where systems are evaluated against authenticity, preservation, faithfulness, robustness, and compositionality. Each evaluation is parameterized by a tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution) that constrains the semantic space and evaluation conditions. Systems are classified into grounding modes (symbolic, referential, vectorial, relational) based on their architecture pipeline implementation. Grounding profiles quantify performance across desiderata, enabling systematic comparison and identifying trade-offs between different grounding approaches.

## Key Results
- Symbolic systems achieve perfect composition but lack etiological warrant for world-referential meanings
- LLMs exhibit correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks but fail selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction
- Human language exemplifies comprehensive grounding via multimodal perception and social coordination across all desiderata
- The framework provides a common language for philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians to systematically investigate grounding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Evaluation Tuple Parameterization
Grounding audits become measurable by fixing context, meaning type, threat model, and reference distribution. The tuple E = (k, t, U, P) constrains evaluation scope, replacing binary grounded/ungrounded judgments with profiled measurements. This assumes metrics d_k,t on meaning spaces can be defined for relevant meaning types.

### Mechanism 2: Architecture Pipeline with Mode Instantiation
Different grounding modes emerge from how architectures implement the symbol→representation→concept→meaning pipeline. Φ encodes surface symbols into representations R, Γ maps representations to concepts C, and A^t_k aligns concepts to typed meaning spaces. The composite S^t_k = A^t_k ∘ Γ is what evaluation measures.

### Mechanism 3: Etiological Faithfulness via Causal Intervention
Correlational fit alone is insufficient; mechanisms must be selected-for success through learning or evolution. G2b requires identifying internal mechanism M and computing ACE_E(M) = E[Pr(succ|do(M=on)) - Pr(succ|do(M=off))], demanding training history access and intervention capability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Uniform continuity and modulus of continuity
  - Why needed here: Robustness (G3) is formalized through modulus ω^t_k,U(ε) bounding semantic drift
  - Quick check: Given a representation space with minimum nonzero distance δ_0, what is ω*(ε) for ε < δ_0?

- Concept: Homomorphism between algebras
  - Why needed here: Compositionality (G4) requires that A^t_kΨ respects semantic algebra operations
  - Quick check: If F(f(σ_1, σ_2)) = f^M(F(σ_1), F(σ_2)) for all constructors f, what property does F satisfy?

- Concept: Average causal effect (ACE) with do-calculus
  - Why needed here: Etiological faithfulness requires distinguishing correlation from causation
  - Quick check: Why does Pr(succ|M=on) - Pr(succ|M=off) fail to capture causality without intervention?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Σ (symbols) -> Φ (encoder) -> R (representations) -> Γ (concept mapper) -> C (concepts) -> A^t_k (aligner) -> M^t_k (meanings)
- Critical path: Define evaluation tuple → instantiate architecture mode → measure G1 (preservation) on atoms → measure G2a (faithfulness) on composites → estimate G2b (ACE) via intervention → fit G3 (robustness modulus) under threat model → assess G4 (compositionality) on held-out combinations
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Discrete R (symbolic): perfect G4, degenerate G3, fails G2b without selection history
  - Continuous R (vectorial): smooth G3, approximate G4, G2b holds only for trained task families
  - Sensorimotor R (referential): strongest G2b for world tasks, limited for abstractions
- Failure signatures:
  - High ε_pres with moderate δ_comp: miscalibrated atoms (fix G1 first)
  - High G2a, low G2b: lucky shortcut exploiting spurious correlations
  - Low G3 under small perturbations: brittle discrete representations or adversarial vulnerability
  - High β on in-distribution, low on novel combinations: memorization, not composition
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run preservation audit: For each atomic symbol σ in test vocabulary, compute d_k,t(A^t_kΨ(σ), I^t_k(σ)). Report ε^k,t_pres distribution
  2. Estimate robustness modulus: Sample representations r ~ P, apply perturbations u ∈ U at scale ε, fit ω^k,t_U(ε). Compare benign vs. adversarial threat models
  3. Test systematicity on held-out compositions: Create D_novel with unseen attribute-noun or relational combinations. Compute β^k,t as fraction within tolerance τ of target

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can meaning spaces for social-normative contexts (t=soc) be rigorously metrized to enable evaluation of grounding in dialogue and pragmatic tasks? The authors state that "no consensus exists" on metrics for social space and ask how to metrize dialogue commitments and normative statuses. This remains unresolved because defining d_k,t that respects intuitive similarity while remaining empirically tractable is non-trivial for abstract or cultural concepts.

### Open Question 2
What specific training interventions or architectural changes are required to transition a system's profile from "memorizer" or "brittle algebraist" to "grounded" or "smooth generalist"? The framework currently captures grounding as a static snapshot and lacks a predictive theory for how grounding profiles evolve during learning.

### Open Question 3
Can a system that satisfies correlational faithfulness (G2a) but fails etiological faithfulness (G2b) maintain robustness under distribution shift, or is the lack of "selection-for" a reliable predictor of catastrophic failure? The paper notes that verifying "selected for" success is practically challenging and remains unresolved whether correlation without etiology constitutes genuine grounding or merely reliable coincidence.

## Limitations
- The framework's empirical applicability hinges on intervention accessibility for ACE estimation, which may not be available for proprietary systems
- The assumption that meaningful metrics d_k,t can be defined for all meaning types (especially social-normative) remains unproven in many domains
- The decomposition into separable components (Φ, Γ, A^t_k) may not hold in practice, limiting mode classification validity

## Confidence

- High confidence: The formalization of evaluation tuples as a parameterization tool; the decomposition of architectures into Φ→Γ→A^t_k pipeline; the basic metrics for G1 preservation and G3 robustness
- Medium confidence: The causal framework for G2b etiological faithfulness (pending intervention accessibility); the mode classification system; the homomorphism requirement for G4 compositionality
- Low confidence: The existence of meaningful metrics for social-normative meanings; the universality of the five-desiderata framework across all semantic domains; the claim that human language achieves all desiderata comprehensively

## Next Checks

1. **Intervention Feasibility Study**: Systematically attempt ACE estimation on diverse architectures where training data is accessible. Quantify the gap between correlational fit and causal warrant, and document which systems permit meaningful intervention.

2. **Metric Construction Challenge**: For each meaning type (extensional, inferential, social-normative), design and validate concrete distance metrics d_k,t on representative meaning spaces. Focus particularly on social-normative meanings where metric construction appears most challenging.

3. **Cross-Modal Robustness Comparison**: Apply the robustness audit framework to identical semantic tasks across symbolic, vectorial, and referential architectures. Compare the resulting ω^t_k,U(ε) curves under identical threat models to quantify representation-space-dependent brittleness.
