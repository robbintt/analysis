# KAIROS: Scalable Model-Agnostic Data Valuation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.23799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23799
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Scalable model-agnostic data valuation using MMD with O(1/N²) error guarantees and 50× speedup over baselines

## Executive Summary
KAIROS introduces a novel framework for scalable data valuation using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute closed-form influence functions. Unlike traditional methods requiring retraining, KAIROS provides exact leave-one-out rankings with theoretical guarantees. The method excels at detecting feature noise, label corruption, and backdoors while maintaining computational efficiency through online updates in O(mN) time.

## Method Summary
KAIROS leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a kernel-based discrepancy measure to create closed-form influence functions that avoid costly retraining. The framework operates on feature representations rather than raw data, enabling model-agnostic application across different learning tasks. By computing influence scores directly from MMD distances, KAIROS achieves exact leave-one-out rankings with O(1/N²) error bounds, significantly outperforming Wasserstein-based alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves exact leave-one-out rankings without retraining, with O(1/N²) error guarantees
- Provides up to 50× speedup over baseline methods for data valuation tasks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10, STL-10, IMDB, and AG News datasets for noise detection and data pruning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by using MMD to measure distributional differences between model predictions with and without specific data points. This kernel-based approach captures complex feature relationships while maintaining computational tractability. The closed-form solution eliminates the need for expensive retraining, enabling real-time influence scoring and online updates.

## Foundational Learning

**Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**
Why needed: Provides a kernel-based measure of distributional difference between model predictions with/without data points
Quick check: Verify MMD values decrease when adding similar data points and increase with outliers

**Kernel Bandwidth Selection**
Why needed: Critical parameter that affects MMD sensitivity and computational stability
Quick check: Test with multiple bandwidth values to observe ranking stability

**Closed-form Influence Functions**
Why needed: Enables exact leave-one-out calculations without retraining
Quick check: Compare influence scores with empirical leave-one-out retraining

**Density Separation**
Why needed: Allows interpretable thresholds for data quality assessment
Quick check: Validate that high-quality data clusters separately from corrupted samples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Points -> MMD Kernel -> Influence Score Calculator -> Data Valuation Rankings

**Critical Path**
The MMD kernel computation followed by influence score calculation represents the computational bottleneck, with runtime scaling as O(mN) for online updates.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method trades computational efficiency for exact influence calculations, sacrificing some precision compared to full retraining but gaining scalability. The kernel choice affects both accuracy and runtime, requiring careful bandwidth tuning.

**Failure Signatures**
Performance degrades when kernel bandwidth is poorly chosen, leading to unstable rankings. The method may struggle with highly imbalanced datasets where density separation becomes less meaningful.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Run on a small synthetic dataset with known corrupted points to verify detection accuracy
2. Compare MMD-based influence scores with empirical retraining on a subset of data
3. Test online update capability by incrementally adding clean and noisy points

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees assume specific kernel properties that may not hold in real-world datasets
- Performance on highly imbalanced datasets and extreme label corruption scenarios remains unclear
- 50× speedup claim requires verification across diverse hardware configurations

## Confidence

**High**
- Core algorithmic approach using MMD for influence functions is well-supported
- Efficiency gains over retraining-based methods are demonstrated

**Medium**
- Effectiveness across all mentioned dataset types is demonstrated but may vary with dataset characteristics

**Low**
- Generalization to entirely different data modalities beyond tested types
- Practical utility of O(1/N²) error guarantee in real-world applications

## Next Checks

1. Test KAIROS on highly imbalanced datasets with varying levels of class distribution skew to assess performance degradation.
2. Implement the method on a new, previously unseen dataset type (e.g., time series or graph data) to evaluate generalizability.
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the kernel bandwidth parameter to understand its impact on both accuracy and runtime across different dataset sizes.
