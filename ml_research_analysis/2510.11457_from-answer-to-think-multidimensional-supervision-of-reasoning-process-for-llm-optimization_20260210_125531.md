## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Dimension-level Reward Modeling (DRM), a method for optimizing LLM reasoning by supervising the reasoning process along three interpretable dimensions: Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence. Unlike outcome-only rewards like RLVR, DRM provides dense supervision signals that capture reasoning quality directly, enabling both off-policy (DPO) and on-policy (GRPO) optimization without requiring ground-truth answers. The approach shows consistent improvements across diverse reasoning tasks, particularly excelling in scenarios where RLVR fails to provide meaningful supervision.

## Method Summary
DRM computes three dimensional scores from reasoning outputs: Confidence (token log-probabilities from the target model), Relevance (via NLI entailment and semantic ranking using Qwen3-8B-RERANKER), and Coherence (via external ORM using Llama-3.3-Nemotron-70B-REWARD). These scores are normalized within groups and combined with weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.7) to form a dense reward signal. For training, DRM supports both off-policy optimization via DPO+SFT (batch 128, lr 5e-7) and on-policy optimization via GRPO (rollout 16, batch 256). The method operates without ground-truth answers by constructing preference pairs from DRM-scored samples.

## Key Results
- DRM outperforms RLVR@T+F across multiple reasoning tasks, with Math500 improving from 43.4 to 48.4 and CodeScope from 37.4 to 41.1 for LLaMA3.1-8B
- Combining DRM with RLVR in GRPO achieves the best performance, matching or exceeding either method alone (e.g., AMC23: 24.5 vs 20.5/23.0 for LLaMA)
- GPT-4o evaluation shows DRM-constructed training sets have substantially fewer "correct answer with flawed reasoning" cases compared to RLVR
- DRM@ANY (without answer information) still outperforms RLVR, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning supervision alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence dimensions provides more reliable reasoning assessment than any single dimension alone.
- Mechanism: Each dimension captures distinct aspects of reasoning quality—Confidence via token log-probabilities (sum for answers, mean for reasoning), Relevance via NLI entailment and semantic similarity across Q→R, R↔D, R→A relationships, and Coherence via external ORM scoring. These are normalized and weighted-summed to produce dense rewards.
- Core assumption: High-quality reasoning exhibits faithful certainty, semantic grounding, and logical consistency simultaneously; no single dimension is sufficient for robust assessment.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] defines DRM's three dimensions; [Table 2, Section 2] specifies implementation; [corpus] PRL supports multidimensional decomposition.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DRM rewards can serve as effective supervision signals for both off-policy (DPO) and on-policy (GRPO) optimization without requiring ground-truth answers.
- Mechanism: In DPO, DRM scores select preference pairs (highest vs lowest scoring reasoning). In GRPO, DRM advantages are computed via group-relative normalization and added to or substituted for RLVR advantages. The dense signal provides gradients even when answer correctness is uniform.
- Core assumption: Models can learn to produce higher-quality reasoning by optimizing for dimensional scores that proxy reasoning soundness, even absent answer verification.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.3, Table 4] shows DRM@ANY outperforms RLVR@T+F; [Section 3.4, Table 6] demonstrates combined DRM+RLVR performance; [corpus] LeTS confirms complementarity of supervision types.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DRM supervision reduces "correct answer with flawed reasoning" cases compared to RLVR.
- Mechanism: By scoring reasoning quality directly, DRM preferentially selects samples where sound reasoning supports the answer. RLVR's binary outcome signal ignores reasoning flaws in correct answers.
- Core assumption: GPT-4o evaluation can reliably identify flawed reasoning in correct-answer samples; reduction in such cases indicates genuine quality improvement.
- Evidence anchors: [Figure 2a] shows fewer flawed reasoning instances in DRM vs RLVR; [Section 4.1] confirms DRM prioritizes higher reasoning quality; [corpus] Mitigating Think-Answer Mismatch supports need for reasoning-aware signals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**
  - Why needed here: DRM is explicitly designed to address RLVR's limitations (sparse rewards, ignoring reasoning quality). Understanding RLVR clarifies what DRM improves upon.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RLVR rewards become nearly constant when a model is too strong or too weak on training data?

- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - Why needed here: DRM uses DPO with SFT loss for off-policy training. Understanding preference pair construction from DRM scores is essential for implementation.
  - Quick check question: How would you construct preference pairs using DRM scores from a set of candidate responses?

- **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**
  - Why needed here: Relevance dimension relies on NLI entailment to assess Q→R and R→A relationships. Understanding NLI helps interpret Relevance scoring.
  - Quick check question: What NLI relationship should hold between a sound reasoning process and its final answer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Input (Q, D) -> Model -> Output (R, A) -> DRM Scoring Pipeline -> Weighted normalized sum -> R_DRM reward -> Optimization

- **Critical path**:
  1. Deploy judge models: Qwen3-8B-RERANKER for Relevance, LLAMA-3.3-NEMOTRON-70B-REWARD for Coherence
  2. Extract token log-probabilities from target model for Confidence
  3. Normalize each dimension within groups before weighted combination
  4. Grid-search weights on validation set (paper uses 0.1, 0.2, 0.7 for Conf/Rel/Coh)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Weight configuration (0.1, 0.2, 0.7) is fixed post-validation but optimal weights vary by model (Table 7 shows different best weights per model)
  - External ORM for Coherence adds inference cost but captures textual quality
  - NLI entailment for Relevance may not capture domain-specific reasoning patterns

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Single-dimension supervision yields inconsistent gains (Figure 2b heatmap shows drops on some tasks)
  - On certain knowledge-intensive datasets (MuSR, GPQA), combining RLVR with DRM slightly underperforms DRM alone—suggesting interference when outcome rewards overlook reasoning process
  - Assumption: Judge model biases propagate into DRM scores

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce RewardBench 2 evaluation: Generate 20 samples per instance, select highest-DRM sample, verify answer correctness matches Table 3 improvements
  2. Ablate each dimension: Train with only Confidence, Relevance, or Coherence supervision to confirm cooperative effects require all three
  3. Weight sensitivity: Grid search weights on held-out validation and compare fixed (0.1, 0.2, 0.7) vs model-specific optimal configurations on a downstream benchmark

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the dimensional weights (Confidence, Relevance, Coherence) be optimally determined or adapted for diverse model architectures without requiring manual grid search?
- Basis: [inferred] Appendix E.1 states that "best weight configurations differ slightly across models," indicating that the fixed weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.7) used in the main experiments may not be universally optimal.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology relies on a grid search on a validation set, which may not scale efficiently to new architectures or domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive weighting mechanism that automatically tunes dimension contributions based on model feedback or task features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent is the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM) signal susceptible to the biases or limitations of the specific external models employed as judges (e.g., the reranker and reward model)?
- Basis: [inferred] Section 3.1 explicitly notes the reliance on Qwen3-8B-Reranker and Llama-3.3-Nemotron as judges, but does not ablate the impact of swapping these specific judge models.
- Why unresolved: If the external judges struggle with specific semantic nuances, the DRM supervision signal will propagate those errors to the policy model.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study showing performance stability when swapping the underlying judge models for alternatives of similar or different sizes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does the combination of RLVR and DRM supervision occasionally lead to performance drops on specific knowledge-intensive or reasoning-focused tasks compared to DRM-only supervision?
- Basis: [explicit] Section 3.4 notes that the combined approach "shows slight drops in certain reasoning-focused or knowledge-intensive datasets... suggesting that in these cases direct RLVR may interfere with the optimization."
- Why unresolved: The interaction between the answer-level binary signal (RLVR) and the dimensional reasoning signal (DRM) is not fully understood, particularly when ground truth answers conflict with reasoning process quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the gradient updates or reward distributions in tasks where the combined approach fails versus where it succeeds.

## Limitations

- Normalization ambiguity: The paper states dimensional scores are "normalized within its group" but doesn't specify the exact method, making exact reproduction challenging.
- Judge model reliability: DRM depends entirely on external judge models whose biases or calibration issues could propagate into DRM rewards.
- Generalization across domains: Fixed weight configuration was selected on validation data, but the paper acknowledges optimal weights vary by model, suggesting potential overfitting.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of combining Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence dimensions is clearly specified with concrete implementation details.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about reducing "correct answer with flawed reasoning" cases are supported by GPT-4o evaluation, though evaluation methodology isn't fully detailed.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that DRM outperforms RLVR across all tasks has exceptions (MuSR, GPQA show slight degradation when combined).

## Next Checks

1. **Judge model calibration validation** - Test whether the NLI and ORM judge models themselves produce consistent, meaningful scores across diverse reasoning patterns by evaluating their agreement with human judgments on a subset of samples.

2. **Weight sensitivity analysis** - Systematically vary the dimensional weights beyond the fixed 0.1/0.2/0.7 configuration across multiple models and tasks to identify conditions where alternative weightings significantly outperform the default.

3. **Reasoning quality attribution** - For cases where DRM improves performance, analyze whether improvements stem from better reasoning processes or if models are learning to game the reward dimensions without genuine reasoning enhancement.
