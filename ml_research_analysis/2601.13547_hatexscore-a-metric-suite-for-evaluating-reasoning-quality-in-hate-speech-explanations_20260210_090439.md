# HateXScore: A Metric Suite for Evaluating Reasoning Quality in Hate Speech Explanations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.13547
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13547
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: Four-component metric suite revealing interpretability failures and annotation inconsistencies invisible to standard accuracy/F1 metrics

## Executive Summary
HateXScore is a four-component metric suite designed to evaluate the reasoning quality of model explanations in hate speech detection. It assesses conclusion explicitness, faithfulness and causal grounding of quoted spans, protected group identification, and logical consistency among these elements. Evaluated on six diverse hate speech datasets spanning English, Chinese, and Korean, it reveals interpretability failures and annotation inconsistencies invisible to standard metrics like Accuracy or F1. Human evaluation shows strong agreement with HateXScore, validating it as a practical tool for trustworthy and transparent moderation.

## Method Summary
The method evaluates zero-shot LLM-generated explanations using four sub-metrics: HTC (conclusion correctness), QF (quotation faithfulness via probability shift when masking quoted spans), TGI (protected group identification via lexicon matching), and CC (logical consistency). The overall HateXScore is the unweighted average of these components. The approach is tested across six datasets (HateXplain, Latent Hatred, HASOC, HateCheck, ToxiCN, KOLD) using multiple models including GPT-4o, LLaMA-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen-7B, and Gemma variants. Tokenization uses language-specific tools (spaCy, jieba, KoNLPy), and protected group lexicons are compiled from UN, Meta, Twitter, and YouTube policies.

## Key Results
- HateXScore effectively reveals interpretability failures and annotation inconsistencies invisible to standard metrics
- Human evaluation shows strong agreement with HateXScore (Fleiss' κ of 0.783 for QF and 0.746 for TGI)
- The suite successfully evaluates explanations across three languages (English, Chinese, Korean)
- Models can generate high HateXScore explanations even when disagreeing with dataset labels, highlighting potential annotation errors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Masking quoted spans from the input text and measuring prediction probability shifts validates whether the explanation's cited evidence causally supports the model's decision.
- **Mechanism**: QF extracts quoted spans Q from the explanation, masks them from the original text T, and computes |p_orig - p_mask|. A larger shift indicates the quoted content genuinely influenced the hateful/non-hateful classification.
- **Core assumption**: The model's probability output reflects genuine reliance on the masked content rather than spurious correlations or memorization.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section 3.2] "We mask all spans in Q from T... and compute model probabilities on both original and masked texts (p_orig, p_mask)." [Section 5.2] On Latent Hatred, Qwen-7B shows "quotation faithfulness remains moderate, which indicates that part of the rationale is not fully causal." [Corpus] HatePrototypes (arXiv:2511.06391) similarly addresses implicit hate detection but without the causal masking validation mechanism.
- **Break condition**: If models develop alternative reasoning pathways that bypass quoted content (e.g., relying on positional features), QF scores will drop even for valid explanations.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Predefined, policy-configurable protected group lexicons enable cross-lingual target identification while allowing domain-specific customization.
- **Mechanism**: TGI extracts n-grams (up to trigrams) from explanations, lemmatizes them, and matches against configurable group lists (UN definitions, Meta, Twitter, YouTube policies). For hateful samples, it validates the group is tied to hateful context via NER/POS patterns.
- **Core assumption**: Protected group terminology can be captured via lexicon matching; novel or obfuscated references (e.g., coded language) may be missed.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section 3.3] "Users may also supply their own custom group lists in the form of a dictionary, enabling full configurability." [Section 4.1] Evaluated on "English, Chinese, and Korean" with language-appropriate tokenizers (spaCy, jieba, KoNLPy). [Corpus] Lost in Moderation (arXiv:2503.01623) documents how commercial APIs over/under-moderate group-targeted hate, supporting the need for explicit group detection.
- **Break condition**: Evolving slang, dog-whistles, or multilingual code-switching will reduce TGI accuracy unless lexicons are actively maintained.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Aggregating four complementary sub-metrics into an unweighted average provides a transparent, interpretable diagnostic signal that correlates with human judgment.
- **Mechanism**: HateXScore = (HTC + QF + TGI + CC) / 4. Human evaluation showed Fleiss' κ of 0.783 (QF) and 0.746 (TGI) between binarized model outputs and annotators, comparable to inter-human agreement.
- **Core assumption**: Equal weighting is appropriate for general use; specific applications may require re-weighting.
- **Evidence anchors**: [Section 5.3] "Annotators preferred the model's prediction 74.8% of the time when the HateXScore exceeded 0.5." [Section 3.5] "Practitioners may re-weight components to reflect application-specific policies." [Corpus] No direct corpus comparison to weighted aggregation schemes was found.
- **Break condition**: If one sub-metric is systematically more important for a specific policy regime, equal weighting may obscure critical failures.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Faithfulness vs. Plausibility in Explanations
  - **Why needed here**: QF measures faithfulness (actual causal influence), not just plausibility (human-like reasoning). Without this distinction, models can generate convincing but unfaithful explanations.
  - **Quick check question**: If you mask the quoted text and the prediction doesn't change, is the explanation faithful?

- **Concept**: Multilingual Tokenization Strategies
  - **Why needed here**: The pipeline uses spaCy (English/European), jieba (Chinese), and KoNLPy (Korean). Incorrect tokenization breaks span extraction and n-gram matching.
  - **Quick check question**: Why would word-boundary-based tokenization fail for Chinese text?

- **Concept**: Annotation Subjectivity in Hate Speech
  - **Why needed here**: The paper explicitly addresses how labels can be disputed (e.g., reclaimed slurs, implicit hate). HateXScore evaluates explanation quality independently of label agreement.
  - **Quick check question**: A model correctly identifies a slur and target group but disagrees with the dataset label—should it be penalized?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (T, ŷ, E) -> Span extractor (extract Q) -> QF calculator (mask Q, compute |p_orig - p_mask|) -> TGI matcher (extract n-grams, lemmatize, match against group list) -> CC evaluator (threshold-based logic) -> Aggregator (unweighted mean)
- **Critical path**: QF computation is the bottleneck—it requires inference on both original and masked texts. Batch masking and parallel inference are recommended optimizations.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Lenient τ (0.3) captures partial faithfulness but may pass weak explanations; stricter thresholds (0.5+) increase precision but reduce coverage. Lexicon-based TGI is interpretable but brittle to novel expressions; embedding-based matching would be more robust but less transparent. Fuzzy matching for span extraction handles minor paraphrasing but risks false positives.
- **Failure signatures**: QF = 0 with high HTC/TGI: Model quotes entire input text (trivial explanation) or no span found. High QF with TGI = 0: Model identifies causal evidence but fails to name the targeted group. High HateXScore with low Accuracy: Potential annotation error—flag for human review (per Section 6.1).
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Threshold sensitivity analysis: Sweep τ from 0.1 to 0.9 on a held-out subset; plot HateXScore distribution and model ranking stability (replicate Appendix A.4). 2) Language tokenizer swap: Replace jieba with pkuseg for Chinese; measure TGI score variance on ToxiCN to assess tokenizer sensitivity. 3) Perturbation robustness test: Apply controlled explanation edits (irrelevant quotes, hallucinated groups, omitted causation) as in Table 4; verify HateXScore decreases appropriately.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does HateXScore perform when extended to multimodal hate speech detection (e.g., image-text memes)?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "HateXScore currently focuses on evaluating static, text-based explanations; future work could explore dynamic or multimodal reasoning (e.g., image-text hate speech)"
- **Why unresolved**: The current implementation only processes text; extending to multimodal contexts would require new methods for extracting quoted rationales from visual elements and assessing cross-modal causal grounding.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A study applying HateXScore to multimodal hate speech datasets (e.g., Facebook Hateful Memes), with adapted QF and TGI components for visual content, and comparison with human evaluations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How should partial target coverage be scored for posts attacking multiple protected groups?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "For instances attacking multiple protected groups, we currently mark TGI as successful if the explanation identifies any clearly targeted group... Future work can adopt graded coverage labels or set-based scoring."
- **Why unresolved**: Binary TGI scoring may overstate performance on multi-target examples; no graded metric exists to reward partial coverage proportionally.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and validation of a graded TGI scoring scheme on a multi-target hate speech corpus, correlated with human judgments of explanation completeness.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How robust is HateXScore across low-resource languages beyond English, Chinese, and Korean?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors note that "more languages are still to be expanded" and rely on language-specific tokenizers (spaCy, jieba, KoNLPy) and pre-built protected group lists.
- **Why unresolved**: Performance in languages with limited NLP tooling or without standardized hate speech lexicons remains untested; tokenization and lemmatization errors may propagate to QF and TGI scores.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Cross-lingual evaluation on low-resource language hate speech datasets, with analysis of tokenizer quality, group list coverage, and human correlation in each language.

## Limitations

- QF scores can be artificially low if models quote irrelevant text or fail to quote causal evidence, regardless of true reasoning quality
- Lexicon-based TGI will miss novel slurs, code-switching, or evolving hate terminology unless lexicons are actively maintained
- Equal weighting of sub-metrics assumes balanced importance across contexts, but policy-specific applications may require re-weighting not yet validated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The four-component framework addresses distinct aspects of reasoning quality (conclusion correctness, causal grounding, target identification, logical consistency). Human evaluation shows strong agreement (κ > 0.7) with binarized metric outputs.
- **Medium confidence**: Cross-lingual applicability across English, Chinese, and Korean; sensitivity to τ threshold (0.3 default) balances leniency and precision; effectiveness in flagging annotation inconsistencies.
- **Low confidence**: Performance on emerging hate phenomena (coded language, multimodal content); impact of re-weighting components for specific policy contexts; long-term stability as hate speech evolves.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold sensitivity validation**: Systematically sweep the faithfulness threshold τ from 0.1 to 0.9 on held-out subsets, measuring HateXScore distribution shifts and model ranking stability. Compare against inter-annotator agreement at each threshold to identify optimal operating points per dataset.

2. **Tokenizer impact assessment**: Replace jieba with pkuseg for Chinese tokenization in ToxiCN, measuring TGI score variance and cross-tokenizer agreement. Repeat for other languages if feasible to quantify tokenizer-induced measurement noise.

3. **Perturbation robustness testing**: Apply controlled explanation edits (inserting irrelevant quotes, omitting target group mentions, reversing causal logic) to generate synthetic failure cases. Verify HateXScore decreases appropriately and identify which sub-metrics are most sensitive to each manipulation type.
