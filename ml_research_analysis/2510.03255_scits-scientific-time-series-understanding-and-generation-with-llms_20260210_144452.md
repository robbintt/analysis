# SciTS: Scientific Time Series Understanding and Generation with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.03255
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03255
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces comprehensive benchmark for scientific time series understanding and generation across 12 domains, 43 tasks, and 50k+ instances

## Executive Summary
SciTS introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for scientific time series understanding and generation, covering 12 disciplines with varying frequencies, lengths, and dimensions. The benchmark evaluates 17 models including text-only LLMs, multimodal LLMs, and specialized time series models on 43 tasks. Results demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs show superior cross-domain generalization compared to specialized models, but are limited by representing time series as text or images. The proposed TimeOmni framework explicitly models temporal dynamics through patch-based encoding, achieving top performance while remaining compatible with general LLM training.

## Method Summary
TimeOmni processes time series through a dynamic routing mechanism that selects patch sizes to maintain output sequences between 100-200 tokens, followed by 1D convolution patch experts and cross-attention patch reprogramming to align with LLM vocabulary embeddings. The framework uses Qwen3-8B with DoRA fine-tuning and supports both understanding (softmax head) and generation (regression heads) tasks. Training employs joint optimization with batch sizes of 6 for understanding and 1 for generation tasks, using Adam optimizer with 2e-5 learning rate and DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 for distributed training.

## Key Results
- General-purpose LLMs demonstrate better cross-domain generalization than specialized time series models
- Representing time series as text or images limits performance due to excessively long sequences or loss of numerical precision
- TimeOmni framework achieves top performance by integrating explicit temporal modeling with LLM reasoning capabilities
- Specialized models show many unsupported tasks while TimeOmni handles all 43 benchmark tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Patch-based encoding with dynamic routing enables handling of time series with vastly different lengths and frequencies.
- **Mechanism:** A Router selects patch size $D_{patch}$ based on input length $T$ to ensure output sequence length falls between 100–200 tokens ($T/200 < D_{patch} < T/100$). Multiple patch experts with different patch sizes process the signal via 1D convolution, then patch reprogramming aligns embeddings to LLM vocabulary space via cross-attention.
- **Core assumption:** Scientific time series require bounded token sequences to fit within LLM context windows while preserving temporal dynamics; fixed patch sizes would fail across $10^0$ to $10^7$ length ranges.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 4.1]: "the Router selects a patch size $D_{patch}$ to ensure that the output sequence length after the Patch Expert layer falls between 100 and 200"
  - [Section 4.1]: "Patch Reprogramming module re-represents the time series using the LLM's vocabulary embeddings... $X_{patch}$ attends to $E$ via multi-head cross-attention"
  - [Corpus]: Weak direct evidence for routing mechanisms in related work; most multimodal TS papers focus on forecasting rather than unified understanding+generation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Treating time series as a distinct modality (rather than text or image conversion) preserves numerical precision and avoids context-length explosion.
- **Mechanism:** Text serialization creates token sequences proportional to time series length, exceeding context limits for long signals (e.g., bioacoustics, gravitational waves). Image rasterization compresses sequences but sacrifices numerical precision needed for generation tasks. Direct encoding via patch-based convolutional projection preserves both.
- **Core assumption:** Numerical precision matters more for generation tasks (forecasting, imputation) while sequence compression matters more for long inputs; neither text nor image representations satisfy both constraints simultaneously.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Abstract]: "representing time series as text or images limits their performance due to excessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively"
  - [Section 6.2]: "representing time series as text can produce extremely long inputs that are difficult for LLMs to process"
  - [Section 6.3]: "representing time series as text generally outperforms image-based inputs for generation tasks where precise numerical values are critical"
  - [Corpus]: "Format Matters" paper (arXiv:2511.10075) similarly finds modality representation affects reasoning robustness.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** General-purpose LLMs exhibit stronger cross-domain generalization than specialized time-series models, but require explicit temporal modeling to match domain-specific performance.
- **Mechanism:** Specialized models (Moirai, TimeMoE, Chronos) excel on supported tasks but fail on unsupported ones (imputation, QA, multivariate handling). LLMs leverage broad pretraining to handle diverse domains, but direct text/image conversion limits effectiveness. TimeOmni combines LLM reasoning with patch-based temporal encoding.
- **Core assumption:** Scientific time series share latent temporal dynamics that transfer across domains; LLMs' reasoning capabilities complement but don't replace specialized temporal feature extraction.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 6.4]: "general-purpose LLMs demonstrate better generalisation to unseen domains compared with specialised time-series models"
  - [Table 3-4]: Specialized models show many "(X/Y)" entries indicating unsupported tasks; TimeOmni supports all 43 tasks with top average ranking.
  - [Section 7]: "pairing [LLMs] with dedicated temporal processing is crucial to handle complex scientific dynamics"
  - [Corpus]: "Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis" (arXiv:2510.13029) argues reasoning beyond pattern recognition is needed for real-world TS analysis.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Patch-based tokenization for sequential data
  - **Why needed here:** TimeOmni converts variable-length time series into fixed-length token sequences via overlapping/non-overlapping patches processed through convolution, analogous to ViT patch embedding but for 1D signals.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a time series of length 1000 and target sequence length ~100, what patch size would the router select? (Answer: $D_{patch} \approx 10$, since $1000/200=5 < D_{patch} < 10 = 1000/100$)

- **Concept:** Cross-attention for modality alignment
  - **Why needed here:** Patch reprogramming uses cross-attention where time series patch embeddings query LLM vocabulary embeddings, projecting temporal features into the LLM's representation space without modifying pretrained weights.
  - **Quick check question:** In cross-attention, which modality provides the query vs. key/value? (Answer: Time series patches are queries, LLM vocabulary embeddings are keys/values—this aligns TS features to LLM space.)

- **Concept:** Regression heads for sequence generation
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike text generation via softmax over vocabulary, time series generation requires continuous-valued outputs via linear regression heads, with head selection based on target output length.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't we use standard language modeling (softmax + sampling) for numerical time series generation? (Answer: Discrete vocabulary cannot represent continuous numerical values with required precision; regression heads map directly to continuous output space.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input preprocessing -> Time Series Encoder (Router -> Patch Expert -> Patch Reprogramming) -> LLM Backbone -> Output heads

- **Critical path:**
  1. Input signal → flattening → router computes $D_{patch} = \lceil T/150 \rceil$ (heuristic midpoint)
  2. Patch Expert produces $X_{patch} \in R^{\lceil T/D_{patch} \rceil \times D_{enc}}$
  3. Cross-attention with projected LLM embeddings produces $X_{enc} \in R^{T_{enc} \times D_{llm}}$ where $T_{enc} \approx 100-200$
  4. Concatenate with text prompt embeddings (prompt-as-suffix for understanding, prefix for generation)
  5. LLM forward pass → head selection based on task type

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Router simplicity vs. optimality:** Current heuristic ($T/200 < D_{patch} < T/100$) is simple but may not be optimal for all signal types; learned routing could improve but adds complexity.
  - **Single encoder vs. domain-specific experts:** Single patch expert family handles all domains uniformly; could miss domain-specific inductive biases (e.g., periodicity in meteorology vs. sparsity in gravitational waves).
  - **Joint training vs. staged training:** Joint understanding+generation training ensures compatibility but may suffer from gradient interference; staged training could stabilize but requires careful scheduling.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **TLS (Too Long Sequence):** Input exceeds max context after patch encoding; router selected patch size too small. Fix: Enforce minimum $D_{patch}$ for very long inputs.
  - **TMC (Too Many Channels):** Flattened multivariate signals exceed capacity; model trained primarily on univariate data. Fix: Per-channel processing or channel attention before flattening.
  - **INF (Instruction Not Followed):** Model generates wrong output length/format for generation tasks. Fix: Stronger length conditioning in prompt or dedicated length tokens.
  - **Numerical drift:** Regression head outputs unrealistic values (MAPE > 100%). Fix: Normalize inputs, add numerical stability constraints, or use quantized regression.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate patch size selection:** Compare fixed patch sizes (16, 32, 64, 128) vs. dynamic routing on a subset of domains with varying lengths (astronomy: $10^1$–$10^4$, bioacoustics: $10^3$–$10^7$). Metric: success rate + MAPE.
  2. **Probe cross-attention alignment:** Visualize attention patterns from patch reprogramming layer; check if temporal structure is preserved vs. collapsed to generic LLM tokens. Expected: local temporal patterns should attend to semantically related vocabulary tokens.
  3. **Compare modality representations on held-out domain:** Train TimeOmni on 11 domains, evaluate on 12th (e.g., hold out radar). Compare against: (a) text-serialized input to same LLM, (b) image input to multimodal LLM, (c) specialized TS model. Metric: domain transfer gap.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does supervised fine-tuning on the SciTS benchmark significantly narrow the performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and specialized time-series models?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section: "Due to resource constraints, we evaluate all models in a zero-shot setting without finetuning."
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper establishes that general-purpose LLMs generalize better in zero-shot settings, but it remains untested whether specialized models would outperform LLMs if both were fine-tuned on the specific scientific domains provided in SciTS.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study benchmarking the performance delta of models (e.g., TimeMoE vs. Llama-3) after fine-tuning on the SciTS training split versus their zero-shot baselines.

- **Open Question 2:** Why do current "thinking" or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanisms fail to enhance performance on time-series tasks?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Limitations section notes that "preliminary small-scale experiments indicate that enabling the 'thinking' mode in closed-source LLMs does not improve performance on time-series tasks."
  - **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if this failure stems from the linguistic nature of current CoT implementations being incompatible with numerical reasoning, or if the models lack the fundamental numerical precision required to execute multi-step temporal logic.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An analysis of intermediate reasoning traces in models like GPT-4 or Gemini when processing SciTS tasks, determining if the logic generated is factually incorrect or if the numerical execution steps fail.

- **Open Question 3:** Does the flattening strategy employed by TimeOmni for multivariate signals degrade performance by discarding inter-channel spatial dependencies?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper describes the TimeOmni architecture as flattening input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}$ to $X' \in \mathbb{R}^{NT \times 1}$ (Section 4), but also highlights tasks involving high-dimensional data such as 58-channel EEG (Section 3.2) where channel topology is critical.
  - **Why unresolved:** Flattening multivariate data into a single sequence treats channel dimensions as temporal extensions, potentially losing the spatial relationships (e.g., sensor proximity) that specialized graph-based time-series models utilize.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study on high-channel-count tasks (e.g., Neuroscience tasks) comparing TimeOmni’s sequential attention against a variation that utilizes explicit channel-attention mechanisms.

## Limitations

- Exact prompt templates for all 43 tasks and router selection heuristic remain underspecified
- Benchmark relies on 15+ external datasets with varying preprocessing requirements
- Evaluation focuses on zero-shot transfer without extensive ablation studies on routing mechanism
- Computational efficiency trade-offs of the routing mechanism versus simpler approaches not addressed

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core observation that general-purpose LLMs outperform specialized time series models on cross-domain generalization is well-supported by Table 3-4, which shows consistent performance gaps and numerous "(X/Y)" entries indicating unsupported tasks in specialized models. The TimeOmni framework architecture is clearly specified with sufficient detail for implementation.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that text/image representations limit performance due to sequence length and numerical precision issues is supported by comparative results in Section 6, but the paper doesn't systematically quantify the degradation from each representation type across all task categories. The routing mechanism's effectiveness across the full 10^0-10^7 length range is demonstrated but not exhaustively validated.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that TimeOmni achieves "top performance" across all 43 tasks requires scrutiny—while it shows strong average ranking, specific task-level comparisons against specialized models on their supported tasks are limited. The paper doesn't address computational efficiency trade-offs of the routing mechanism versus simpler approaches.

## Next Checks

1. **Router Selection Robustness**: Implement TimeOmni with multiple router strategies (fixed patch sizes vs. dynamic selection) and evaluate success rate and MAPE on held-out domains with extreme length variations (bioacoustics: 10^3-10^7 samples, astronomy: 10^1-10^4 samples). Compare against baseline text serialization and image representation methods on identical tasks.

2. **Cross-Attention Alignment Verification**: Visualize and analyze the attention patterns from the patch reprogramming layer when processing signals from different domains (e.g., periodic vs. sparse signals). Verify that temporal structure is preserved and that patch embeddings attend to semantically meaningful vocabulary tokens rather than collapsing to generic patterns.

3. **Domain Transfer Gap Quantification**: Train TimeOmni on 11 domains, hold out one domain (e.g., radar), and measure performance degradation versus in-domain training. Compare this transfer gap against specialized time series models and standard LLM approaches (text and image inputs) to quantify the benefit of explicit temporal modeling for cross-domain generalization.
