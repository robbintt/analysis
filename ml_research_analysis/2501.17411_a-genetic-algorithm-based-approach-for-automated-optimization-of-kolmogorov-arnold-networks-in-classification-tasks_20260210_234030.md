# A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach for Automated Optimization of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Classification Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.17411
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17411
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: GA-KAN achieves 100% accuracy on Iris, Wine, and WDBC datasets while reducing parameters vs. standard KANs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GA-KAN, a genetic algorithm-based approach for automated optimization of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in classification tasks. The method addresses the labor-intensive manual tuning typically required for KAN optimization by using a genetic algorithm to automatically search for optimal network architectures. The key innovation includes a new encoding strategy that captures neuron connections, grid values, and network depth into chromosomes, combined with a decoding process that uses degradation mechanisms and zero masks to explore diverse KAN configurations.

GA-KAN was validated across five classification datasets (Iris, Wine, Rice, WDBC, Raisin) and demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning models and standard KANs. The approach achieved 100% accuracy on Iris, Wine, and WDBC datasets, 90% on Raisin, and 95.14% on Rice, while significantly reducing the number of parameters across all datasets. Additionally, GA-KAN provided interpretable symbolic formulae for the Wine and Iris datasets, enhancing model transparency. The method represents the first application of evolutionary computation for automatic KAN optimization, offering improved accuracy, interpretability, and parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
GA-KAN automates KAN architecture optimization through genetic algorithms that search over neuron connections, grid values (1-64), and depth (1-4 layers). The method uses binary chromosome encoding with connection matrix bits, 6-bit grid values, and 2-bit depth encoding. A population of 100 individuals evolves over 20 generations using tournament selection, neuron-level crossover (swap same-position neurons), and bit-flip mutation rate of 0.5. Fitness is determined by minimum validation loss over 20 LBFGS training steps. The decoding process employs degradation mechanisms and zero masks to reduce network depth and explore diverse configurations. LBFGS optimizer is used with 20 epochs per evaluation. The approach was validated on five UCI classification datasets with specific train/val/test splits.

## Key Results
- GA-KAN achieved 100% accuracy on Iris, Wine, and WDBC datasets, 90% on Raisin, and 95.14% on Rice classification tasks
- Significant parameter reduction compared to standard KANs across all tested datasets
- Provided interpretable symbolic formulae for Wine and Iris datasets
- Outperformed traditional machine learning models and standard KANs in both accuracy and efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GA-KAN works by transforming the challenging manual KAN architecture optimization problem into an automated evolutionary search process. The binary chromosome encoding captures essential KAN components (connections, grid values, depth) in a compact representation that allows efficient genetic operations. The degradation mechanism and zero masks enable exploration of diverse architectures by dynamically removing or masking layers during decoding, preventing the search from getting stuck in local optima. The neuron-level crossover preserves meaningful structural patterns while allowing variation, and the fitness evaluation via LBFGS optimization ensures that only architectures with good learning capacity survive to subsequent generations. This combination of evolutionary search with KAN-specific encoding and decoding strategies effectively navigates the complex architecture space to find high-performing, interpretable models.

## Foundational Learning
- **Genetic Algorithm Basics**: Population-based metaheuristic using selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations. Why needed: Provides the optimization framework for searching KAN architectures. Quick check: Verify population evolves and improves over generations.
- **KAN Architecture Components**: Neurons with learnable activation functions (grids), connections between layers, and network depth. Why needed: Understanding these components is essential for proper encoding/decoding. Quick check: Ensure decoded networks produce valid forward passes.
- **Chromosome Encoding Strategy**: Binary representation combining connection matrices, grid values (6 bits), and depth (2 bits). Why needed: Enables genetic operations to manipulate KAN structures. Quick check: Validate encoding/decoding produces consistent architectures.
- **Fitness Evaluation via LBFGS**: Using optimization algorithm to train and evaluate KAN performance within the evolutionary loop. Why needed: Provides meaningful fitness scores for selection pressure. Quick check: Monitor validation loss trends during evolution.
- **Degradation Mechanism**: Process for removing fully-zero layers to reduce network depth dynamically. Why needed: Enables exploration of shallower architectures and prevents bloat. Quick check: Plot depth distribution across generations.
- **Zero Mask Application**: Technique for masking layers during decoding to explore diverse architectures. Why needed: Increases search space diversity and helps escape local optima. Quick check: Verify zero masks are being applied correctly during decoding.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Chromosome Encoding -> Decoding (with degradation/zero masks) -> LBFGS Training -> Fitness Evaluation -> Selection/Crossover/Mutation -> Next Generation

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is chromosome decoding followed by fitness evaluation. Invalid architectures (disconnected input/output) must be rejected immediately with infinite fitness to prevent wasted computation. The LBFGS training step must complete successfully to provide meaningful fitness scores.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The encoding uses 6 bits for grid values (64 possibilities) which balances granularity with chromosome length. Neuron-level crossover preserves structural patterns but may be computationally expensive. The 20-generation limit with population 100 represents a balance between search thoroughness and computational cost. Using LBFGS for fitness evaluation trades training time per individual against the quality of fitness signals.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- High rejection rate of invalid architectures (>50%) suggests encoding constraints are too loose
- No improvement in best fitness over generations indicates crossover/mutation rates may be inappropriate
- All individuals converge to maximum depth suggests degradation mechanism isn't functioning
- Extremely long chromosomes (>1000 bits) may indicate encoding inefficiency

**First Experiments**:
1. Test chromosome encoding/decoding with known patterns to verify bit manipulation works correctly
2. Run single generation with fixed fitness function to validate LBFGS training and fitness assignment
3. Implement tournament selection and crossover, verify offspring inherit parent characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exact implementation details for neuron-level crossover and zero mask application remain unspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Random seeds are not provided, making exact reproduction of convergence curves and final architectures impossible
- The degradation mechanism's implementation details are vague, particularly regarding when and how fully-zero layers are identified and removed

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Classification accuracy results on benchmark datasets, parameter reduction claims, and the general GA framework (population size, generations, selection method)
- **Medium Confidence**: The encoding/decoding scheme for chromosome representation, fitness function formulation, and the core concept of using evolutionary algorithms for KAN optimization
- **Low Confidence**: Exact implementation of neuron-level crossover, zero mask generation and application logic, and the precise degradation mechanism details that could significantly impact search efficiency

## Next Checks
1. **Crossover Implementation Validation**: Implement both bit-level and neuron-level crossover variants and compare search efficiency. Track whether networks with disconnected input/output structures appear and validate the fitness assignment of +∞ works as intended.
2. **Zero Mask Functionality Test**: Plot depth distribution across generations to verify the degradation mechanism activates properly. If all networks remain at maximum depth, the zero masks are likely not functioning as intended.
3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary mutation rate (0.3-0.7), population size (50-200), and grid value bit-width (4-8 bits) to assess robustness and identify optimal configurations for different dataset characteristics.
