# Decentralized Online Convex Optimization with Unknown Feedback Delays

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07901
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07901
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposed algorithm achieves O(N√dtot + N√T/(1-σ²)^¼) regret for general convex losses without prior delay knowledge

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses decentralized online convex optimization with unknown, time-varying feedback delays in multi-agent systems. The key challenge is designing algorithms that can adapt to delays without prior knowledge of their total magnitude, which is critical for federated learning applications. The authors propose a novel algorithm combining accelerated gossip-based communication with adaptive learning rates, eliminating the need for centralized coordination while achieving strong regret guarantees.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach uses a decentralized protocol where agents estimate delays locally through gossip strategies. The algorithm combines accelerated gossip-based communication with an adaptive learning rate mechanism that automatically adjusts to observed delays. For general convex losses, the framework achieves regret bounds that improve upon previous results by eliminating the need for delay knowledge and providing better dependence on network parameters. The method extends to strongly convex losses with appropriate modifications to the learning rate schedule.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(N√dtot + N√T/(1-σ²)^¼) regret for general convex losses without prior delay knowledge
- Extends to strongly convex losses with O(Nδmax ln T/α + N ln N ln T/(α√(1-σ²))) regret
- Proves matching lower bounds up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating tightness
- Experimental validation shows improvements over existing baselines across different network topologies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by leveraging gossip-based communication to estimate delays locally without centralized coordination. The adaptive learning rate mechanism automatically adjusts to observed delays, allowing the algorithm to maintain performance even when delays are unknown a priori. The accelerated gossip protocol ensures efficient gradient aggregation across the network while the delay estimation prevents stale information from degrading convergence.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Decentralized optimization with gossip protocols** - Why needed: Enables gradient aggregation without centralized server; Quick check: Verify spectral gap condition holds for chosen communication matrix
2. **Online convex optimization regret bounds** - Why needed: Framework for measuring algorithm performance; Quick check: Confirm O(√T) dependence for general convex losses
3. **Delay compensation in optimization** - Why needed: Critical for handling stale gradients; Quick check: Ensure delay estimation mechanism converges

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Agents -> Gossip Protocol -> Gradient Aggregation -> Adaptive Learning Rate -> Optimization Step

**Critical Path:**
Gradient computation → Gossip averaging → Delay estimation → Adaptive learning rate adjustment → Next iterate update

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Gossip-based vs centralized delay estimation: Decentralized approach eliminates single point of failure but may converge slower
- Adaptive vs fixed learning rate: Adaptive rates handle unknown delays but add computational overhead
- Accelerated vs standard gossip: Acceleration improves convergence but requires stronger spectral gap assumptions

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degraded performance when network connectivity is poor (spectral gap close to 1)
- Slow convergence when delays are highly variable or bursty
- Instability in learning rate when gradient norms are small

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test algorithm on a simple 2-agent network with synthetic delays to verify basic functionality
2. Compare regret bounds against known baselines on standard convex loss functions
3. Evaluate sensitivity to network topology by testing on complete graph vs sparse graph

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the gap in the polynomial dependence on the number of agents N between the upper and lower regret bounds be closed?
- Basis in paper: The authors note in Theorem 7 that while the bounds are tight regarding T, dtot, and the spectral gap, "there is still a gap of polynomial factors in the number of agents N."
- Why unresolved: The current lower bound derivation does not perfectly match the N factor in the upper bound.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deriving a new lower bound that matches the N dependence of the proposed algorithms, or developing a new algorithm that matches the existing lower bound's dependence on N.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed algorithms be extended to handle time-varying network topologies?
- Basis in paper: The paper assumes a fixed graph G and communication matrix W in the Preliminaries.
- Why unresolved: The analysis relies heavily on the constant spectral gap 1 - σ2(W) of a static matrix W.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical regret bounds that account for variation in the spectral gap over time.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the regret guarantees be maintained in a bandit feedback setting where agents observe only the loss value rather than the gradient?
- Basis in paper: The Related Works section mentions "D-OCO and its bandit counterpart" and "limited-feedback scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The current algorithms require ∇f_t as input, while bandit settings introduce gradient estimation variance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified algorithm using one-point or two-point gradient estimators with regret analysis.

## Limitations
- Practical scalability of gossip-based delay estimation in large networks is not fully characterized
- Regret bounds rely on specific assumptions about delay distributions that may not hold in all scenarios
- Performance degradation for small strong convexity parameters α is not fully characterized

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High
- Experimental validation: Medium
- Practical implementation complexity: Low

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate algorithm performance on heterogeneous networks with varying agent connectivity patterns beyond tested topologies
2. Test robustness under bursty delay patterns and non-stationary delay distributions not covered in theoretical analysis
3. Implement and benchmark the full adaptive learning rate mechanism in a real federated learning system to measure practical overhead and convergence speed
