# Leveraging KANs for Expedient Training of Multichannel MLPs via Preconditioning and Geometric Refinement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18131
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: KAN architectures with B-splines are structurally equivalent to multichannel MLPs with fixed biases, enabling preconditioned optimization and geometric refinement methods that significantly outperform existing approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a fundamental structural equivalence between KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) architectures with B-spline bases and multichannel MLPs with fixed biases, differing only in their basis functions. This insight leads to two key contributions: leveraging the preconditioning effect of B-splines to accelerate training by improving Hessian conditioning, and introducing hierarchical geometric refinement methods that significantly outperform existing interpolation-based approaches. The study also proposes a parameterization for free-knot splines, addressing concerns about grid dependence in KANs. Experimental results on regression and PINN problems demonstrate that spline-based KANs outperform both ReLU MLPs and traditional KANs, with multilevel refinement yielding orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and training efficiency.

## Method Summary
The authors establish that KAN architectures with B-spline bases are structurally equivalent to multichannel MLPs with fixed biases, where the key difference lies in the choice of basis functions. This equivalence reveals that B-splines provide a preconditioning effect that improves Hessian conditioning, leading to faster convergence during training. Building on this insight, the paper introduces hierarchical geometric refinement methods that adaptively refine the spline grid based on error indicators, outperforming traditional interpolation-based approaches. Additionally, the authors propose a parameterization for free-knot splines that eliminates grid dependence while maintaining the benefits of preconditioning. The methodology combines these elements into a unified framework that accelerates training and improves accuracy across various benchmark problems.

## Key Results
- KANs with B-splines achieve preconditioning effects that improve Hessian conditioning, accelerating training convergence
- Hierarchical geometric refinement methods significantly outperform existing interpolation-based approaches in accuracy and efficiency
- Free-knot spline parameterization addresses grid dependence concerns while maintaining preconditioning benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the structural equivalence between KANs with B-splines and MLPs with fixed biases. This equivalence reveals that B-splines act as a preconditioning mechanism by improving the conditioning of the Hessian matrix during optimization. Better-conditioned Hessians lead to more stable and efficient gradient descent updates, accelerating convergence. The geometric refinement approach works by hierarchically adapting the spline grid based on error indicators, focusing computational resources where they are most needed. This targeted refinement avoids the computational overhead of uniformly dense grids while maintaining accuracy. The free-knot parameterization further enhances this by allowing the grid to adapt dynamically, eliminating the limitations of fixed grid structures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hessian conditioning**: Understanding how the condition number of the Hessian affects optimization convergence speed and stability. Why needed: Critical for explaining why B-splines accelerate training. Quick check: Verify that B-spline bases produce better-conditioned Hessians than ReLU activations.
- **Preconditioning in optimization**: The process of transforming the optimization problem to improve convergence properties. Why needed: Central to understanding the acceleration mechanism. Quick check: Compare convergence rates with and without preconditioning effects.
- **Spline basis functions**: Mathematical representations that provide smooth, piecewise polynomial approximations. Why needed: Forms the foundation of the KAN architecture equivalence. Quick check: Demonstrate how B-splines approximate functions more efficiently than ReLU activations.
- **Geometric refinement strategies**: Adaptive methods for improving approximation accuracy by refining discretization in regions of high error. Why needed: Explains the superior performance of the proposed refinement approach. Quick check: Show error reduction rates for geometric vs. uniform refinement.
- **Free-knot spline parameterization**: Methods for allowing spline knots to move freely rather than being fixed on a grid. Why needed: Addresses the grid dependence limitation of traditional KANs. Quick check: Verify that free-knot splines maintain accuracy without requiring dense grids.
- **Multichannel MLP equivalence**: Understanding how KANs can be viewed as MLPs with specific architectural constraints. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for all subsequent insights. Quick check: Mathematically demonstrate the structural equivalence.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input -> B-spline basis transformation -> Multichannel linear layers with fixed biases -> Output

### Critical Path
The critical path consists of: 1) B-spline basis evaluation, 2) Linear transformation through multichannel layers, 3) Summation of outputs. The B-spline evaluation is the most computationally intensive component, followed by the linear transformations.

### Design Tradeoffs
Fixed bias vs. learnable bias: Fixed biases simplify the architecture and enable the structural equivalence, but may limit representational flexibility. Dense vs. adaptive grids: Dense grids ensure accuracy but increase computational cost, while adaptive grids balance accuracy and efficiency. Traditional vs. free-knot splines: Traditional splines are simpler but grid-dependent, while free-knot splines are more flexible but computationally more complex.

### Failure Signatures
Poor Hessian conditioning manifests as slow convergence and oscillatory training behavior. Inadequate grid resolution leads to systematic approximation errors, particularly in regions of high curvature. Free-knot parameterization may converge to suboptimal knot configurations if initialization is poor or the optimization landscape is complex.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Compare training convergence rates between B-spline KANs, ReLU MLPs, and traditional KANs on a simple regression problem.
2. Evaluate the preconditioning effect by measuring Hessian condition numbers across different basis functions.
3. Test geometric refinement vs. uniform refinement on a function with varying complexity across the domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The structural equivalence between KANs with B-splines and MLPs with fixed biases, while mathematically sound, may not fully capture the practical complexities of real-world applications.
- The preconditioning claims, though convincing for tested problems, may not generalize to all problem domains, particularly those with different optimization characteristics.
- The geometric refinement approach, while effective, relies heavily on specific spline basis functions and may not translate directly to other basis types without modification.

## Confidence
High: Mathematical foundations are rigorous and well-established.
Medium: Experimental methodology is sound, but practical applicability claims need broader validation.
Low: Long-term robustness across diverse problem domains remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. Test the preconditioning effects on a broader range of benchmark problems including high-dimensional cases to assess generalizability.
2. Compare the free-knot parameterization approach against other adaptive grid methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
3. Evaluate the geometric refinement strategy's performance on problems with discontinuities and sharp gradients to assess its robustness in challenging scenarios.
