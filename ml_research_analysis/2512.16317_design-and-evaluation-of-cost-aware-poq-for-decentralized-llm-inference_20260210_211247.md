# Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Cost-aware PoQ improves economic sustainability of decentralized LLM inference by balancing quality and computational cost

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling decentralized large language model (LLM) inference verification to modern models by introducing cost-aware Proof of Quality (PoQ). The authors extend the original PoQ framework by incorporating explicit computational cost considerations into reward mechanisms for both inference and evaluator nodes, using a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost. Through experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization tasks using five instruction-tuned LLMs (TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B) and three evaluation models, the research finds that semantic textual similarity bi-encoders achieve significantly higher correlation with ground truth and GPT scores than cross-encoders, making evaluator architecture a critical design choice.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a cost-aware PoQ framework that extends traditional quality-only reward mechanisms by incorporating computational cost into a linear reward function. The framework evaluates both inference quality and evaluator accuracy using Spearman correlation metrics against ground truth and GPT-4 references. Experiments compare semantic textual similarity bi-encoders against cross-encoders for evaluation tasks, and assess five different LLM sizes (1.1B-3B parameters) across extractive QA and summarization benchmarks. Monte Carlo simulations with 5,000 PoQ rounds model reward distributions under the cost-aware scheme to validate economic sustainability claims.

## Key Results
- Semantic textual similarity bi-encoders achieve significantly higher correlation with ground truth and GPT scores than cross-encoders for evaluator tasks
- Larger models like Llama-3.2-3B demonstrate highest quality per unit latency efficiency
- Cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher rewards to high-quality, low-cost inference models and efficient evaluators while penalizing slow, low-quality nodes
- Monte Carlo simulations validate economic sustainability of the proposed framework under controlled conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The cost-aware PoQ framework works by explicitly incorporating computational costs into the reward mechanism through a linear function that balances normalized quality scores against normalized cost metrics. This dual consideration ensures that nodes are incentivized not just to produce high-quality outputs, but to do so efficiently. The semantic textual similarity bi-encoders outperform cross-encoders because they can process inference outputs and reference texts independently before comparison, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high correlation with ground truth quality assessments. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this approach creates a stable economic environment where efficient nodes are naturally rewarded, encouraging sustainable network participation.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Proof of Quality (PoQ) fundamentals** - Why needed: Understanding the original PoQ framework is essential to grasp how cost-awareness extends it. Quick check: Can identify how PoQ verifies inference quality without centralized trust.

2. **Semantic textual similarity bi-encoders vs cross-encoders** - Why needed: Architecture choice significantly impacts evaluator performance and computational efficiency. Quick check: Can explain why bi-encoders process texts independently while cross-encoders process jointly.

3. **Linear reward function design** - Why needed: The reward mechanism determines economic incentives and network sustainability. Quick check: Can describe how quality and cost normalization creates balanced incentives.

4. **Spearman correlation for quality assessment** - Why needed: Understanding evaluation metrics is crucial for interpreting results. Quick check: Can explain why rank correlation is used instead of absolute differences.

5. **Monte Carlo simulation methodology** - Why needed: Simulations validate economic sustainability claims under various conditions. Quick check: Can identify key parameters and assumptions in the 5,000-round simulation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Inference Nodes -> Evaluation Nodes -> Reward Distribution -> Network Consensus

**Critical Path**: User Request → Inference Node Processing → Output Generation → Evaluator Assessment → Quality-Cost Scoring → Reward Allocation → Consensus Verification

**Design Tradeoffs**: The linear reward function simplifies implementation but may not capture complex quality-cost relationships; bi-encoders offer efficiency but may miss nuanced cross-text relationships that cross-encoders capture.

**Failure Signatures**: Low-quality inference outputs with artificially inflated cost claims; evaluator nodes providing systematically biased assessments; network consensus failure when reward distributions are disputed.

**First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark evaluator performance on held-out test sets to verify correlation claims; 2) Stress test the reward mechanism with adversarial low-quality, high-cost nodes; 3) Scale up to 7B parameter models to assess performance at larger sizes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Experimental scope limited to small LLM models (1.1B-3B parameters), leaving uncertainty about performance with frontier models where costs scale non-linearly
- Linear reward function may oversimplify complex relationships between quality, cost, and real-world economic incentives
- Monte Carlo simulations rely on synthetic distributions that may not capture actual network dynamics including node churn and adversarial behavior

## Confidence

**High**: Architectural findings regarding semantic textual similarity bi-encoders outperforming cross-encoders for evaluation tasks, supported by strong correlation metrics with ground truth and GPT-4.

**Medium**: Cost-quality efficiency rankings of different inference models based on controlled experiments with limited model diversity.

**Low**: Long-term economic sustainability claims dependent on assumptions about node participation dynamics and market equilibrium not empirically validated.

## Next Checks

1. Validate performance scaling by testing the cost-aware PoQ framework with 7B-70B parameter models on diverse, real-world datasets to assess whether quality-cost relationships hold at scale.

2. Implement a pilot decentralized network with actual economic incentives to measure real-world reward distributions, node participation patterns, and convergence behavior compared to Monte Carlo predictions.

3. Conduct adversarial testing to evaluate robustness against low-quality or high-cost nodes attempting to game the reward system through strategic behavior or sybil attacks.
