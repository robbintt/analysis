# Prompting Large Language Models with Partial Knowledge for Answering Questions with Unseen Entities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01290
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01290
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Awakening mechanism reactivates partially relevant knowledge in LLMs, improving performance on KGQA tasks and Unseen Entity KGQA, outperforming traditional RAG baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the concept of "awakening" in large language models (LLMs), where partially relevant knowledge already encoded in model parameters can be reactivated to improve question-answering performance. The authors develop a theoretical framework using attention mechanisms and Markov transitions to explain how reintroducing such knowledge reactivates internal representations. Through experiments on KGQA datasets (2Wiki, CWQ) and a new Unseen Entity KGQA task, they demonstrate that their awakening-based retrieval method outperforms traditional RAG approaches, particularly for incomplete knowledge bases where relevant entities may be missing.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a retrieval-augmented approach that injects partially relevant facts into LLMs during inference. The awakening mechanism leverages the observation that LLMs encode knowledge that may not be immediately accessible but can be reactivated through relevant context. They introduce a theoretical analysis using Markov transitions to model how attention mechanisms can reactivate dormant knowledge representations. For the Unseen Entity KGQA task, they modify the evaluation protocol where entities in questions are not present in the knowledge graph, requiring the model to rely on partial knowledge activation rather than direct entity linking.

## Key Results
- Injecting partially relevant facts improves KGQA performance over no retrieval baseline, with larger gains for knowledge closer to the answer
- Awakening-based retrieval outperforms traditional RAG approaches on the new Unseen Entity KGQA task
- The method demonstrates practical value for incomplete knowledge bases where relevant entities may be missing
- Performance improvements are modest (~1-2% absolute) but consistent across different knowledge proximity levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The awakening mechanism works by reactivating partially relevant knowledge already encoded in LLM parameters through targeted injection of related facts. The theoretical framework uses Markov transition analysis of attention weights to explain how internal representations become reactivated when exposed to semantically related context. This reactivation bridges the gap between what the model knows implicitly and what it can explicitly retrieve, particularly valuable when complete knowledge is unavailable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Markov Transition Analysis**: Models attention weight dynamics to explain knowledge reactivation
  - *Why needed*: Provides theoretical foundation for how attention mechanisms can reactivate dormant knowledge
  - *Quick check*: Validate transition matrices capture meaningful attention patterns

- **Attention Mechanism Theory**: Explains how partial context can reactivate encoded representations
  - *Why needed*: Core mechanism for understanding awakening process
  - *Quick check*: Verify attention patterns change predictably with injected context

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Framework for injecting external knowledge during inference
  - *Why needed*: Enables practical implementation of awakening mechanism
  - *Quick check*: Test retrieval quality impact on awakening effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Retrieval System -> Knowledge Injection Module -> LLM with Awakening Mechanism -> Answer Generation

**Critical Path:**
1. Retrieve partially relevant facts from knowledge graph
2. Inject retrieved facts into LLM context
3. Activate awakening mechanism through attention modulation
4. Generate answer using reactivated knowledge

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Precision vs. recall in retrieval: Higher recall captures more potentially awakening knowledge but increases noise
- Relevance threshold: Stricter thresholds ensure quality but may miss awakening opportunities
- Context length: More context enables better awakening but increases computational cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Performance degradation when injected knowledge is too distant from target answer
- No improvement over baseline when knowledge graph is already complete
- Sensitivity to retrieval quality and relevance assessment

**First Experiments:**
1. Ablation study varying relevance thresholds for injected knowledge
2. Comparison with traditional RAG across different knowledge completeness levels
3. Analysis of attention pattern changes with different types of injected context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical foundation lacks rigorous validation connecting Markov analysis to empirical improvements
- Evaluation limited to KGQA datasets and Unseen Entity KGQA task, limiting generalizability
- Method's robustness to noise and relevance degradation is unclear, particularly for loosely related injected knowledge

## Confidence

**High**: The empirical observation that injecting partially relevant knowledge improves performance over no retrieval baseline is well-supported by experimental results.

**Medium**: The claim that awakening-based retrieval outperforms traditional RAG approaches on Unseen Entity KGQA has experimental support but limited generalizability testing.

**Low**: The theoretical explanation via Markov transitions and attention mechanisms lacks sufficient validation to confidently support the awakening hypothesis.

## Next Checks
1. Test the awakening mechanism across diverse QA domains (e.g., open-domain QA, multi-hop reasoning, fact-checking) to assess generalizability beyond KGQA.
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the minimum relevance threshold for partially relevant facts to be beneficial, and test performance degradation with increasingly noisy injected knowledge.
3. Implement a retrieval component that automatically identifies partially relevant facts, and evaluate whether the awakening mechanism provides practical benefits in end-to-end systems where retrieval quality varies.
