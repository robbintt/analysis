# Are Data Embeddings effective in time series forecasting?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20716
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Removing embedding layers improves forecasting accuracy and efficiency in most state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates the role of embedding layers in time series forecasting by conducting ablation experiments across fifteen state-of-the-art models and four benchmark datasets. The researchers found that embedding layers, despite being standard components in modern architectures, are often redundant for multivariate time series forecasting. Their removal typically results in improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency, with accuracy gains frequently exceeding typical performance differences between competing models. The work challenges the conventional wisdom that embedding layers are universally beneficial and suggests a more critical assessment of architectural complexity in time series models.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing embedding layers from fifteen state-of-the-art time series forecasting models. They evaluated these modified architectures across four benchmark datasets, measuring both forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. The study employed a controlled experimental design to isolate the impact of embedding layers while maintaining consistent training procedures and evaluation metrics across all tested models.

## Key Results
- Removing embedding layers typically improves forecasting accuracy on benchmark datasets
- Computational efficiency gains are observed alongside accuracy improvements
- Accuracy improvements often exceed typical performance differences between competing models
- Embedding layers are frequently redundant for multivariate time series forecasting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide detailed mechanistic explanations for why embedding layers may be redundant in time series forecasting. The empirical findings suggest that direct processing of raw time series features may be sufficient for accurate forecasting in many cases, eliminating the need for learned embeddings that transform input representations.

## Foundational Learning

**Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future values based on historical observations. Why needed: Forms the core application domain where embedding effectiveness is evaluated. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between univariate and multivariate forecasting?

**Embedding Layers**: Neural network components that transform raw inputs into learned representations. Why needed: Central architectural element being evaluated for redundancy. Quick check: How do embeddings differ from simple linear transformations?

**Ablation Studies**: Experimental method where components are systematically removed to assess their contribution. Why needed: Primary methodology for evaluating embedding layer impact. Quick check: What distinguishes ablation studies from ablation-by-substitution approaches?

**Benchmark Datasets**: Standardized datasets used for model evaluation and comparison. Why needed: Provides consistent evaluation framework across multiple models. Quick check: Why are benchmark datasets important for reproducible research?

**Multivariate Time Series**: Sequential data with multiple interdependent variables evolving over time. Why needed: The specific type of data where embedding redundancy is investigated. Quick check: How does multivariate forecasting differ from univariate in terms of model complexity?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Time Series Data -> Embedding Layer (optional) -> Forecasting Model -> Predictions

**Critical Path**: Data input → Model processing → Output generation → Accuracy evaluation → Efficiency measurement

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model complexity vs. performance gain, architectural simplicity vs. theoretical completeness, computational cost vs. potential accuracy improvements

**Failure Signatures**: Accuracy degradation when embeddings are removed would indicate their necessity; computational overhead without accuracy benefits indicates redundancy

**First Experiments**: 1) Remove embeddings from a simple LSTM model and measure accuracy change, 2) Compare training times with and without embeddings on a medium-sized dataset, 3) Test embedding removal on a univariate forecasting task to assess domain specificity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to four benchmark datasets, raising questions about generalizability across domains
- Focuses only on state-of-the-art models that already incorporate embeddings
- Does not explore hyperparameter tuning differences between embedded and non-embedded variants
- Efficiency metrics lack detailed specification across different deployment scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Empirical observation that removing embedding layers improves accuracy on tested datasets

**Medium Confidence**: Generalization that embedding layers are "frequently redundant" for multivariate time series forecasting

**Medium Confidence**: Recommendation to critically assess architectural complexity before adding components

## Next Checks

1. Replicate ablation studies across diverse time series domains (financial, medical, sensor data) to test generalizability beyond four benchmark datasets

2. Test embedding removal in transformer-based forecasting models and architectures designed without embeddings to assess architectural paradigm dependencies

3. Conduct detailed efficiency profiling including memory usage, inference latency, and parameter count for comprehensive computational trade-off analysis
