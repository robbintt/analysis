# Bayesian Evaluation of Large Language Model Behavior

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.10661
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10661
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Bayesian framework quantifies uncertainty in LLM evaluations using Beta-binomial models for binary outcomes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for quantifying statistical uncertainty in black-box evaluations of large language models. Traditional LLM evaluations often rely on binary assessments of outputs without capturing the uncertainty inherent in stochastic text generation. The proposed method uses independent Beta priors on per-input behavior probabilities, with binomial likelihoods to model observed binary outcomes from multiple generations per input. This approach provides posterior distributions for various aggregations of interest, enabling richer uncertainty quantification compared to deterministic evaluation. The framework is demonstrated through case studies evaluating pairwise LLM preferences and measuring refusal rates on harmful inputs.

## Method Summary
The core method employs Beta-binomial modeling where each input is associated with an independent Beta prior on the probability of exhibiting desired behavior. Multiple stochastic generations per input produce binary outcomes that update these priors via binomial likelihoods. The framework supports various aggregation schemes including marginal probabilities, quantiles, and arithmetic means of per-input probabilities. To address evaluation cost concerns, the authors develop sequential algorithms (greedy selection and Thompson sampling) that actively choose which inputs to evaluate next based on uncertainty reduction potential. These algorithms aim to focus computational resources on inputs with higher uncertainty in their estimated behavior probabilities.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that outputs deemed non-refusing under greedy decoding may have significant refusal probabilities under stochastic generation
- Sequential evaluation algorithms (greedy and Thompson sampling) can reduce uncertainty in aggregate metrics more efficiently than round-robin approaches
- Provides concrete case studies showing uncertainty quantification in pairwise LLM preference evaluations and harmful input refusal rate measurements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling the uncertainty inherent in LLM evaluations through Bayesian updating. When LLMs generate text stochastically, a single deterministic output may not represent the full range of possible behaviors. By generating multiple outputs per input and modeling the resulting binary outcomes with Beta-binomial distributions, the framework captures this variability. The sequential algorithms further enhance efficiency by prioritizing inputs where additional evaluations would most reduce uncertainty in the aggregate metrics of interest.

## Foundational Learning
- **Beta distributions as priors**: Used to model uncertainty about per-input behavior probabilities before observing any outputs. Needed because we don't know a priori how an LLM will behave on a given input. Quick check: Verify Beta parameters sum to 1 when normalized.
- **Binomial likelihoods**: Appropriate for modeling multiple binary observations (success/failure) from the same input. Needed to update prior beliefs based on observed generations. Quick check: Confirm likelihood follows binomial form with fixed n trials.
- **Bayesian updating**: Combines prior beliefs with observed data to produce posterior distributions. Needed to quantify uncertainty after seeing evaluation results. Quick check: Posterior should be another Beta distribution (conjugate prior property).
- **Independence assumption**: Treats per-input behavior probabilities as independent across inputs. Needed to simplify the model structure and enable tractable computation. Quick check: Test correlation between similar inputs' behavior probabilities.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Beta prior -> Binomial likelihood -> Posterior distribution -> Aggregation functions -> Sequential selection algorithms

Critical Path: Input selection → Multiple generations → Binary outcome recording → Bayesian updating → Posterior analysis → Uncertainty quantification

Design Tradeoffs:
- Multiple generations per input increase evaluation cost but provide uncertainty quantification
- Independence assumption simplifies computation but may not reflect correlated LLM behavior
- Sequential algorithms reduce total evaluations needed but require real-time computation
- Beta priors are conjugate but choice of parameters affects results

Failure Signatures:
- Overconfident posterior estimates when independence assumption violated
- Computational bottlenecks when evaluating many inputs sequentially
- Poor uncertainty quantification if too few generations per input
- Sequential algorithms getting stuck in local optima

First Experiments:
1. Compare uncertainty estimates from greedy vs. round-robin evaluation on a small benchmark
2. Test sensitivity to Beta prior parameters on inputs with known behavior distributions
3. Evaluate correlation in behavior probabilities across semantically similar inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Strong independence assumption between per-input behavior probabilities may not hold in practice
- Computational overhead of multiple generations per input may be prohibitive in resource-constrained settings
- Framework focuses on binary outcomes, potentially missing nuanced safety issues
- Sequential algorithms' effectiveness depends heavily on underlying distribution of per-input behaviors

## Confidence

*High Confidence*: Mathematical formulation is sound and core concept of Beta-binomial modeling for uncertainty quantification is well-established.

*Medium Confidence*: Practical utility of sequential algorithms shows promise but requires more extensive validation across diverse benchmarks.

*Low Confidence*: Generalizability to complex, multi-class evaluation scenarios remains uncertain, and assumption of independent per-input behavior may not hold in practice.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive sensitivity analysis on Beta prior choices to quantify their impact on posterior uncertainty estimates and identify robust prior specifications.

2. Extend the framework to multi-class outcomes and evaluate its performance on established multi-dimensional LLM evaluation benchmarks to test generalizability.

3. Design experiments to test the independence assumption by evaluating LLM behavior on semantically similar inputs and measuring correlation in their behavior probabilities.
