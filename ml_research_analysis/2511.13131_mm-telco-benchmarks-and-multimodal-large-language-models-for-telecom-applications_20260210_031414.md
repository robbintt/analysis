# MM-Telco: Benchmarks and Multimodal Large Language Models for Telecom Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.13131
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13131
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces MM-Telco, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark suite and associated models tailored for telecom applications, revealing significant performance improvements in fine-tuned models and identifying current weaknesses in multimodal LLMs for telecom-specific tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MM-Telco, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark suite and associated models tailored for telecom applications. It addresses the gap in domain-specific evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) in telecommunications by providing structured datasets covering 3GPP Release 17 documents, including text-based and image-based tasks such as QA, retrieval, and PCAP analysis. The authors develop a fine-tuned Llama model (Llama-VL-Telco) for telecom image generation and editing, and conduct baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. Results show that fine-tuned models achieve significant performance improvements, particularly in telecom-specific tasks, with Llama 3.1 8B outperforming general-purpose models. The benchmark also reveals weaknesses in current multimodal LLMs, especially in image-based reasoning, guiding future research. Overall, MM-Telco provides a robust framework for evaluating and advancing LLM capabilities in telecom, with practical implications for network management, customer support, and documentation.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces MM-Telco, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark suite designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in telecom-specific applications. The methodology involves creating structured datasets from 3GPP Release 17 documents, covering tasks such as question answering, retrieval, and PCAP analysis. The authors fine-tune a Llama model (Llama-VL-Telco) for telecom image generation and editing, and conduct baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The evaluation includes both text-based and image-based tasks, providing a holistic assessment of model performance in telecom contexts. The approach emphasizes domain-specific training and evaluation, aiming to bridge the gap between general-purpose LLMs and the specialized needs of the telecom industry.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models, particularly Llama 3.1 8B, achieve significant performance improvements in telecom-specific tasks.
- The benchmark reveals weaknesses in current multimodal LLMs, especially in image-based reasoning tasks.
- MM-Telco provides a robust framework for evaluating and advancing LLM capabilities in telecom applications, with practical implications for network management and customer support.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of MM-Telco lies in its domain-specific approach to benchmarking and model development. By focusing on telecom applications and utilizing structured datasets from 3GPP Release 17 documents, the framework ensures that models are evaluated on tasks directly relevant to the industry. The fine-tuning of models like Llama-VL-Telco on telecom-specific data allows for improved performance in tasks such as image generation and editing, which are critical for network management and documentation. Additionally, the inclusion of both text-based and image-based tasks provides a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal capabilities, highlighting areas where current models fall short and guiding future research directions.

## Foundational Learning
- **3GPP Release 17 Documentation:** Understanding telecom standards and protocols is crucial for creating relevant benchmark tasks. Quick check: Verify alignment of benchmark tasks with actual 3GPP specifications.
- **Multimodal Learning:** Combining text and image data for telecom applications requires models to understand and reason across modalities. Quick check: Assess model performance on cross-modal tasks like PCAP analysis.
- **Fine-tuning Techniques:** Adapting pre-trained models to domain-specific data improves performance in specialized tasks. Quick check: Compare fine-tuned models against baseline models on telecom-specific benchmarks.
- **Benchmark Design:** Structured evaluation frameworks ensure consistent and meaningful assessment of model capabilities. Quick check: Validate benchmark tasks against real-world telecom scenarios.
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs):** VLMs must handle both visual and textual inputs effectively for telecom applications. Quick check: Evaluate VLM performance on image-based reasoning tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preparation -> Model Fine-tuning -> Benchmark Evaluation -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves preparing structured telecom datasets, fine-tuning models on this data, and evaluating performance using the MM-Telco benchmark. Each step is essential for ensuring that models are both well-trained and accurately assessed.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The choice to focus on 3GPP Release 17 documents provides a standardized but potentially limited view of telecom scenarios. While this ensures relevance, it may not capture the full complexity of operational telecom data. Additionally, the relatively small fine-tuning datasets (e.g., ~400 images for Llama-VL-Telco) balance computational efficiency with the risk of overfitting.

**Failure Signatures:** Models may underperform on tasks requiring complex reasoning or handling of diverse telecom scenarios. Overfitting to the fine-tuning data could lead to poor generalization on unseen telecom data. Multimodal tasks, particularly image-based reasoning, may expose limitations in current VLMs.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate model performance on operational telecom data from real networks to assess practical applicability.
2. Test fine-tuned models on multiple telecom datasets with varying characteristics to measure generalization capabilities.
3. Implement human evaluation studies with telecom domain experts to validate the relevance and accuracy of benchmark tasks and model outputs.
