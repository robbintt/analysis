# Alternative Fairness and Accuracy Optimization in Criminal Justice

## Quick Facts

- Proposes modified optimization framework for balancing individual and group fairness in criminal justice algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental tension between individual and group fairness in algorithmic decision-making for criminal justice applications. The authors propose a novel optimization framework that minimizes weighted error loss while constraining differences in false negative rates across groups within tolerance bounds, offering a more practical alternative to strict parity requirements. The approach aims to improve predictive accuracy while maintaining bounded fairness differences, addressing real-world challenges in implementing algorithmic fairness. The paper introduces a Three Pillars Framework for fair algorithm deployment: need-based decisions, transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a constrained optimization framework that modifies traditional fairness formulations by introducing tolerance bounds on fairness differences between groups. Instead of requiring exact parity in error rates (as in equalized odds or equal opportunity), the approach allows for bounded differences in false negative rates while minimizing overall prediction error. This creates a more flexible optimization problem that can achieve better predictive accuracy while still maintaining meaningful fairness constraints. The mathematical formulation represents fairness as a constraint rather than an objective, allowing the primary goal of minimizing prediction error to be balanced against fairness considerations within specified tolerance levels.

## Key Results
- Modified optimization framework allows flexibility in error trade-offs while maintaining bounded fairness differences
- Proposed approach makes fairness constraints more feasible and improves predictive accuracy compared to strict parity requirements
- Three Pillars Framework provides conceptual guidance for deploying fair algorithms in criminal justice systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by relaxing strict parity constraints that are often infeasible in practice, allowing for bounded differences in false negative rates between groups. By treating fairness as a constraint with tolerance bounds rather than an exact requirement, the optimization problem becomes more tractable and can achieve better overall predictive performance. The weighted error loss minimization ensures that the primary goal of accurate prediction is maintained while the fairness constraints prevent unacceptable disparities. This approach acknowledges that perfect parity may be mathematically impossible or practically undesirable in many real-world scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constrained optimization theory**: Understanding how to balance multiple objectives through constraint formulation is crucial for implementing fairness in ML systems. Quick check: Verify constraint satisfaction in optimization outputs.
- **Fairness metrics**: Familiarity with group fairness measures (equalized odds, equal opportunity) is needed to understand the limitations of strict parity approaches. Quick check: Calculate fairness metrics across demographic groups.
- **Error trade-offs**: Knowledge of how different types of errors (false positives vs. false negatives) affect outcomes is essential for meaningful fairness implementation. Quick check: Analyze error distribution across protected groups.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Fairness Constraint Optimization -> Post-processing Evaluation

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves preprocessing data to identify protected groups, training baseline models, applying the constrained optimization framework, and evaluating both accuracy and fairness metrics. The fairness constraint optimization step is the novel component that distinguishes this approach from standard ML pipelines.

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Tighter fairness constraints may reduce predictive accuracy but ensure more equitable outcomes
- Looser constraints improve accuracy but risk creating larger disparities between groups
- The choice of tolerance bounds represents a policy decision balancing different stakeholder interests

**Failure Signatures**
- Constraint violations indicating the tolerance bounds are too restrictive for the data
- Degraded model performance suggesting the fairness constraints are too tight
- Unintended bias amplification in subgroups not explicitly considered in the constraint formulation

**Three First Experiments**
1. Compare baseline model accuracy and fairness metrics against the constrained optimization approach on synthetic data with known group differences
2. Test sensitivity of results to different tolerance bound values to understand the trade-off space
3. Evaluate the approach on a standard criminal justice dataset (e.g., COMPAS) to assess real-world applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework lacks empirical validation on real criminal justice datasets
- Three Pillars Framework provides conceptual guidance without specific implementation protocols
- Does not address interaction with existing legal frameworks and regulatory requirements

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Mathematical formulation of constrained optimization and critique of strict parity constraints
**Medium confidence**: Claims about improved accuracy while maintaining bounded fairness differences (requires empirical validation)
**Low confidence**: Practical applicability of Three Pillars Framework in real criminal justice settings

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation using real criminal justice datasets (e.g., COMPAS, Broward County recidivism data) to compare the proposed constrained optimization approach against baseline models using standard fairness metrics and accuracy measures.
2. Simulation studies examining the long-term effects of the proposed fairness constraints on system dynamics, including potential feedback loops, changes in arrest patterns, and demographic shifts in the population under supervision.
3. Legal and policy analysis to determine how the proposed approach aligns with existing anti-discrimination laws, constitutional requirements, and departmental policies in various jurisdictions, particularly regarding disparate impact and disparate treatment standards.
