# JEPA as a Neural Tokenizer: Learning Robust Speech Representations with Density Adaptive Attention

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07168
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Two-stage self-supervised framework using JEPA + DAAM for efficient, reversible, language-model-friendly speech tokenization at 47.5 tokens/sec

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a two-stage self-supervised framework that combines Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) to learn robust speech representations and perform efficient tokenization. The system first learns semantic audio features through masked prediction in latent space, fully decoupled from waveform reconstruction, then uses these representations for tokenization via Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and mixed-radix packing. The resulting tokens provide highly compressed, reversible representations at 47.5 tokens/sec that are competitive with and often more efficient than existing neural audio codecs.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two stages: Stage 1 uses JEPA with DAAM to learn semantic audio features via masked prediction in latent space, completely decoupled from waveform reconstruction. Stage 2 leverages these representations for efficient tokenization using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a mixed-radix packing scheme, followed by high-fidelity waveform reconstruction with a HiFi-GAN decoder. The JEPA encoder integrates Gaussian mixture-based density-adaptive gating to perform adaptive temporal feature selection and discover hierarchical speech structure at a low frame rate of 2.5 Hz.

## Key Results
- Achieves 47.5 tokens/sec representation rate with reversible, highly compressed speech tokens
- Performance competitive with existing neural audio codecs while providing language-model-friendly representations
- Discovers hierarchical speech structure at low frame rate (2.5 Hz) through density-adaptive attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining predictive modeling of audio structure with adaptive attention mechanisms that can selectively focus on semantically important temporal regions. The JEPA architecture learns to predict masked portions of latent representations, forcing the model to capture essential semantic content rather than surface-level acoustic details. The density-adaptive attention mechanism uses Gaussian mixture models to dynamically adjust temporal resolution based on the local information density, allowing the system to allocate more tokens to complex speech regions while compressing simpler portions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**: Why needed - provides a framework for learning rich semantic representations through predictive modeling without requiring reconstruction; Quick check - verify masked prediction objective improves semantic feature learning
- **Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism**: Why needed - enables dynamic temporal resolution adjustment based on information content; Quick check - test attention gate responses across different speech complexity levels
- **Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ)**: Why needed - provides efficient, reversible tokenization while maintaining semantic fidelity; Quick check - measure reconstruction quality across different quantization levels
- **Mixed-radix packing scheme**: Why needed - optimizes token allocation and compression efficiency; Quick check - compare compression ratios with fixed-rate quantization
- **HiFi-GAN decoder**: Why needed - enables high-fidelity waveform reconstruction from compressed token representations; Quick check - evaluate reconstruction quality across different speech types
- **Gaussian mixture gating**: Why needed - provides probabilistic framework for adaptive temporal feature selection; Quick check - analyze gate activation patterns across speech segments

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Audio waveform -> JEPA Encoder (with DAAM) -> Latent Representations -> FSQ + Mixed-Radix Packing -> Tokens -> HiFi-GAN Decoder -> Reconstructed waveform

**Critical path**: The core inference pipeline flows through the JEPA encoder with density-adaptive attention, through quantization and packing, to the HiFi-GAN decoder for reconstruction.

**Design tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes semantic compression and language-model compatibility over raw audio fidelity, trading some reconstruction quality for significantly reduced token rates and improved semantic structure discovery.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance on highly noisy or multilingual speech, failure to maintain temporal coherence in longer sequences, reconstruction artifacts from quantization errors, attention gate failures in low-information regions.

**First experiments**: 1) Test JEPA+DAAM vs JEPA alone on tokenization quality, 2) Evaluate reconstruction quality across different quantization levels, 3) Measure attention gate effectiveness in adaptive temporal resolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for longer audio sequences beyond 4-second clips
- Limited evaluation scope lacking cross-corpus generalization tests
- Potential reconstruction artifacts from HiFi-GAN dependency in resource-constrained settings

## Confidence
- Core claim (efficient language-model-friendly tokenization): High
- Compression efficiency vs existing codecs: Medium
- Robustness under diverse acoustic conditions: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test model scalability on longer audio segments (10–30 seconds) to assess density-adaptive attention performance
2. Conduct cross-corpus evaluations using diverse datasets including noisy environments and multilingual speech
3. Perform ablation studies comparing JEPA+DAAM against JEPA alone and other neural tokenizer architectures
