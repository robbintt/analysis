# Flower Across Time and Media: Sentiment Analysis of Tang Song Poetry and Visual Correspondence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.04785
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04785
- Authors: Shuai Gong; Tiange Zhou
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: BERT-based sentiment analysis tracks emotional shifts in Tang-Song poetry, revealing joy-to-sadness/fear transitions linked to historical events and visual culture.

## Executive Summary
This study applies fine-tuned BERT sentiment analysis to examine emotional connotations in Tang-Song poetry, focusing on peony (Tang) and plum blossom (Song) imagery. The research identifies a significant shift from joy-dominated Tang peony poetry to sadness and fear-dominated Song plum poetry, correlating with sociopolitical changes. Cross-validation with visual culture in paintings shows consistent emotional transitions, demonstrating the bidirectional influence between textual expression and visual design in Tang-Song China.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a fine-tuned Chinese BERT model to classify emotions into seven categories (anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, surprise) for 100 randomly selected poems (50 Tang peony, 50 Song plum blossom) from Quan Tangshi and Quan Songci collections. Sentiment scores are statistically correlated with historical event timelines and validated against visual evidence from paintings. The methodology relies on stratified sampling, expert annotation for cross-media alignment, and Pearson correlation analysis to establish connections between textual sentiment, historical events, and artistic representations.

## Key Results
- Strong negative correlation between peony joy and plum sadness (r = -0.82, p < 0.01)
- Positive correlation between plum fear and Jin dynasty invasions (r = 0.76)
- Southern Song plum poetry showing sadness scores averaging 2.4× higher than Northern Song works
- Visual evidence from paintings shows consistent emotional transitions matching poetic sentiment patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuned BERT can capture nuanced emotional valences in classical Chinese poetry across historical periods.
- Mechan: Contextualized embeddings handle metaphorical nuance and polysemy better than lexicon-based methods, enabling detection of emotional shifts tied to specific floral imagery (peonies vs. plum blossoms).
- Core assumption: Classical Chinese metaphors and rhetorical devices map sufficiently to a seven-category emotion taxonomy for computational classification.
- Evidence anchors: BERT fine-tuning described for seven-category emotion classification; weak corpus support from neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If classical poetry relies heavily on allusion or intertextuality not captured in surface tokens, contextual embeddings may misclassify emotions without explicit domain adaptation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Poetic sentiment scores correlate with historical events, suggesting textual affect tracks sociopolitical conditions.
- Mechan: Quantitative sentiment scores (e.g., sadness, fear) rise during periods of upheaval, measurable via statistical correlation between event timelines and emotional variance.
- Evidence anchors: Southern Song sadness scores 2.4× higher than Northern Song; plum fear spikes align with Jin dynasty invasions (1125-1127).
- Break condition: If poem dating is uncertain or authorship attribution varies, correlation strength may be inflated by sampling bias or retrospective periodization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Textual sentiment patterns correspond to contemporaneous visual representations in paintings.
- Mechan: Emotional tone in poetry maps to stylistic shifts in art, enabling cross-media validation of sentiment transitions.
- Evidence anchors: Ma Yuan's "Plum Blossoms in Snow" resonate with high poetic sadness; visual patterns validated against textual sentiment shifts.
- Break condition: If visual artifacts are fragmentary or attributed incorrectly, correspondences may reflect curator bias rather than genuine intermedial patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: BERT contextual embeddings
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on fine-tuning Chinese BERT for classical poetry; understanding bidirectional context encoding is prerequisite to reproducing or extending the model.
  - Quick check question: How does BERT's masked language modeling objective enable context-sensitive representations compared to static word embeddings?

- Concept: Correlation vs. causation in historical NLP
  - Why needed here: The paper claims historical events "align" with sentiment shifts; distinguishing statistical correlation from causal mechanism is critical for interpretation.
  - Quick check question: If sadness scores rise during invasion periods, what confounds could explain this besides direct historical causation?

- Concept: Cross-modal grounding
  - Why needed here: The framework links textual sentiment to visual artifacts; understanding how to operationalize cross-media comparison is necessary for replication.
  - Quick check question: What quantitative features of a painting could serve as proxies for "sadness" or "joy" to match textual sentiment scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data layer (Quan Tangshi/Quan Songci poetry corpus + visual artifact database) -> NLP layer (Fine-tuned Chinese BERT -> 7-class emotion classifier -> sentiment scores) -> Analysis layer (Statistical correlation + cross-reference to visual features) -> Validation layer (Expert annotation/art-historical interpretation)
- Critical path: 1) Corpus construction (stratified random sampling) 2) BERT fine-tuning on classical Chinese poetry 3) Inference on 100 poems -> emotion score vectors 4) Temporal aggregation by dynasty 5) Correlation analysis with historical events 6) Cross-media mapping to painting features
- Design tradeoffs: Sample size (100 poems) enables manual validation but limits statistical power; seven-category taxonomy balances granularity with annotation feasibility; visual analysis remains qualitative without computer vision component
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to canonical poets if stratification fails; anachronistic emotion projection if modern categories misalign with Tang-Song concepts; spurious correlation if historical dating is imprecise
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce BERT fine-tuning with held-out validation set and report per-class F1 2) Extend corpus to 500+ poems with bootstrap resampling to test correlation stability 3) Pilot computer vision module to extract painting features and correlate with textual sentiment scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can this BERT-based sentiment framework be successfully applied to other floral motifs (e.g., chrysanthemum, orchid, bamboo) and to dynastic transitions beyond Tang-Song?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The introduction states: "The same framework could be extended to other floral motifs or applied to different historical periods."
- Why unresolved: Current study examines only peony (Tang) and plum blossom (Song); other culturally significant flora with documented symbolic evolution remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication studies applying identical methodology to additional motifs and periods, demonstrating consistent cross-media correlation patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does survival bias in material culture artifacts affect the measured correlations between poetic sentiment and visual representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors acknowledge: "The fragmentary nature of surviving material culture means that our visual dataset cannot be comprehensive."
- Why unresolved: Surviving paintings likely represent elite patronage rather than broader visual culture; the extent to which this skews correlation measurements is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis using statistical correction models, or comparison with larger museum databases to assess representativeness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the observed gender differences in emotional expression (e.g., Li Qingzhao's elevated fear scores) generalize across a larger corpus of female-authored poetry?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that Li Qingzhao's plum verses "express much stronger fear than male contemporaries," but analyzes only one female poet, leaving systematic gender patterns unexplored.
- Why unresolved: Historical constraints on women's published poetry create small sample sizes; whether this pattern reflects individual style or broader gendered expression remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Expanded corpus including all extant female-authored Tang-Song poetry with gender-stratified statistical comparison.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can computational models be enhanced to independently detect classical Chinese metaphorical allusions without extensive post-hoc scholarly interpretation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors state: "while BERT excels at contextual analysis, interpreting classical Chinese metaphors still requires scholarly judgment."
- Why unresolved: Classical poetry relies on dense allusion, polysemy, and intertextual references that contextual embeddings may not capture without domain-specific training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of fine-tuned models with classical commentary corpora, validated against expert annotations of metaphorical passages.

## Limitations
- Emotion classification for classical Chinese poetry remains challenging due to polysemy, allusion, and stylistic differences from modern Chinese
- The 100-poem sample size limits statistical robustness and generalizability of correlation metrics
- Cross-media validation is qualitative and relies on art-historical interpretation without quantitative visual analysis pipeline

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in sentiment shift claims (Tang joy → Song sadness/fear), given alignment with known historical transitions but limited manual validation
- Low confidence in cross-media correspondence claims due to absence of quantitative visual analysis pipeline
- Medium confidence in correlation with historical events, contingent on precise poem dating and avoidance of retrospective periodization bias

## Next Checks
1. Manually annotate 50 poems with emotion labels and compute BERT classification F1 to confirm classifier reliability on classical Chinese
2. Bootstrap sentiment analysis on 500+ randomly sampled Tang-Song poems to test stability of reported correlation coefficients
3. Extract quantitative visual features (color saturation, edge density, composition symmetry) from Tang-Song flower paintings and correlate with textual sentiment scores for initial cross-media validation
