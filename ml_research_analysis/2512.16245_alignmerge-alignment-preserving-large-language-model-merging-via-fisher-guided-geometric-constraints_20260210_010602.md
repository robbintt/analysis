# AlignMerge - Alignment-Preserving Large Language Model Merging via Fisher-Guided Geometric Constraints

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.16245
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16245
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Alignment-preserving merging via Fisher-guided geometric constraints improves alignment metrics while matching or exceeding expert-level utility

## Executive Summary
AlignMerge introduces a geometry-aware model merging framework that treats alignment as an invariant rather than a scalar metric. By operating in a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned anchor, it explicitly constrains merges to respect alignment-sensitive directions using a combination of Fisher-geodesic proximity, an alignment-subspace penalty, and a soft alignment budget. Evaluated across five model families, AlignMerge consistently improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge scores) while matching or exceeding expert-level utility, outperforming standard merging schemes and safety-aware baselines. The approach reduces alignment-subspace drift and budget violations, positioning alignment-preserving merging as a first-class design goal for future foundation model composition.

## Method Summary
AlignMerge leverages a Fisher-information-based parameterization to define a local tangent space around an alignment-anchored model. It combines three loss terms: a Fisher-geodesic proximity loss to keep the merged model close to the alignment reference in parameter space, an alignment-subspace penalty to minimize drift from alignment-sensitive directions, and a soft alignment budget to constrain deviation from alignment behavior. The framework operates by first selecting an anchor model, identifying alignment-sensitive directions via Fisher matrices, and then blending candidate models under these geometric constraints. This preserves alignment properties while integrating diverse capabilities, achieving better alignment-utility trade-offs than standard and safety-aware merging baselines.

## Key Results
- Consistently improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge scores) while matching or exceeding expert-level utility
- Outperforms standard merging schemes and safety-aware baselines across five model families
- Reduces alignment-subspace drift and budget violations in model merging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AlignMerge treats alignment as a geometric invariant rather than a scalar metric to be post-hoc adjusted. By parameterizing merges in a local Fisher chart, it ensures that updates remain close to alignment-sensitive directions in parameter space. The three-component loss function directly constrains both parameter-level and behavior-level alignment preservation, preventing drift into misaligned regions while still allowing capability integration. This principled geometric approach contrasts with heuristic or post-hoc alignment methods, yielding more robust and reliable alignment preservation during model composition.

## Foundational Learning

**Fisher Information Geometry** - Captures local curvature of the loss landscape around an anchor model; needed to define a stable parameter space for constrained merging; quick check: verify Fisher matrix is positive definite locally.

**Alignment-Subspace Identification** - Locates parameter directions most sensitive to alignment behavior; needed to prevent drift during merges; quick check: correlate subspace directions with alignment metric gradients.

**Geodesic Proximity Regularization** - Enforces short paths in Fisher space between anchor and merged models; needed to limit harmful parameter deviations; quick check: monitor geodesic distance during optimization.

**Soft Alignment Budget** - Allows controlled deviation from strict alignment constraints to preserve utility; needed to balance safety and performance; quick check: verify budget threshold is not violated post-merge.

**Multi-Family Model Compatibility** - Ensures the merging framework works across diverse architectures; needed for broad applicability; quick check: validate merging stability across model sizes and families.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Fisher chart setup -> Alignment-subspace detection -> Multi-loss constrained optimization -> Post-merge alignment validation

**Critical Path:** Anchor model selection -> Fisher matrix computation -> Subspace extraction -> Constrained merging optimization -> Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Strict alignment preservation vs. utility retention; geometric fidelity vs. computational cost; soft vs. hard alignment constraints

**Failure Signatures:** Alignment drift in safety metrics; violation of alignment budget; instability in Fisher-based parameterization; poor cross-family merging compatibility

**First Experiments:** 1) Validate Fisher matrix stability and positive definiteness; 2) Test alignment-subspace detection sensitivity; 3) Confirm soft alignment budget enforcement during merges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper highlights the need to extend alignment-preserving merging to larger, more diverse model families and modalities, investigate the scalability of Fisher-based methods, and explore adaptive alignment budgets that adjust based on deployment context. It also calls for systematic study of the long-term behavior of merged models under continual updates and real-world safety evaluations.

## Limitations
- Scalability of Fisher matrix computations to very large models remains an open challenge
- Requires an alignment-tuned anchor model, limiting applicability when such anchors are unavailable
- Soft alignment budget may still permit some alignment drift under extreme capability integration

## Confidence

**High:** Alignment metric improvements are consistent across multiple model families and tasks; method is grounded in solid geometric principles

**Medium:** Long-term stability and real-world safety impacts are not fully characterized; scalability to frontier models not yet demonstrated

**Low:** Limited analysis of failure modes under adversarial inputs or extreme capability merges

## Next Checks
1. Verify Fisher matrix positive definiteness and stability in the local chart around the anchor
2. Test alignment-subspace detection robustness by perturbing alignment metrics and observing subspace changes
3. Evaluate soft alignment budget enforcement by intentionally pushing merges toward the constraint boundary and checking post-merge alignment scores
