# Hybrid Data can Enhance the Utility of Synthetic Data for Training Anti-Money Laundering Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.18499
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18499
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Hybrid data (synthetic transactions + country-level indicators) improved RGCN AML model performance from 64.93% accuracy/7.75% F1/43.64% AUC to 83.39% accuracy/59.37% F1/74.63% AUC

## Executive Summary
The paper demonstrates that combining synthetic financial transaction data with publicly available country-level indicators significantly improves anti-money laundering (AML) detection performance. A Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) trained on hybrid data achieved 83.39% accuracy and 59.37% F1-score, substantially outperforming the same model trained on synthetic data alone (64.93% accuracy, 7.75% F1). This approach preserves privacy by using synthetic transactions while enhancing model utility through contextual features like Basel AML Index, Digital Evolution Index, Corruption Perceptions Index, and GDP per Capita. The results offer a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems without compromising sensitive customer data.

## Method Summary
The study combines JPMorgan synthetic AML transaction data (523,877 transactions, 80/20 class imbalance) with four country-level indicators from public sources. Transactions are represented as edges in a graph with accounts as nodes, augmented by country-level features joined based on origin/destination countries. A 2-layer RGCN with 16 hidden neurons is trained for binary classification (suspicious vs. non-suspicious transactions). The hybrid approach adds country-level contextual features to the synthetic transaction data, creating a more informative training dataset that preserves privacy while improving detection performance.

## Key Results
- RGCN trained on hybrid data achieved 83.39% accuracy vs. 64.93% for synthetic-only baseline
- F1-score improved dramatically from 7.75% to 59.37% with hybrid data
- AUC increased from 43.64% to 74.63%, indicating strong discriminative ability
- Country-level indicators (Basel AML Index, Digital Evolution Index, Corruption Perceptions Index, GDP per Capita) provided essential contextual features absent in synthetic data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Contextual Feature Augmentation
Real-world country-level features provide contextual risk signals that synthetic data lacks, enabling the model to learn correlations between geographic factors and money laundering patterns. The approach assumes country-level risk indicators are predictive of transaction-level behavior and remain stable across contexts.

### Mechanism 2: Graph Neural Network Architecture for Relational Learning
RGCN architecture captures network patterns in transaction data through relational message passing between heterogeneous entities (accounts, financial institutions, countries). The model learns from both node features and graph topology simultaneously, outperforming traditional ML approaches for imbalanced anomaly detection.

### Mechanism 3: Privacy-Preserving Data Utility Enhancement
Combining privacy-preserving synthetic transactions with aggregate public country-level data creates training data that approximates real-world conditions without exposing sensitive customer information. The approach assumes public country-level indicators contain predictive signal that generalizes to real deployment contexts.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Financial Networks
**Why needed here:** Understanding how GNNs propagate information across graph structures and handle heterogeneous node/edge types is essential for interpreting results and potential improvements.
**Quick check question:** Can you explain how message passing in a GNN differs from feature processing in a traditional neural network, and why this matters for detecting coordinated money laundering patterns?

### Concept: Synthetic Data Limitations in Financial ML
**Why needed here:** Understanding limitations of purely synthetic AML datasets (missing contextual features, realism gaps, limited edge/node attributes) is crucial for evaluating when and how to apply this hybrid approach.
**Quick check question:** What are three key limitations of synthetic financial data that could impact AML model performance, and how does each limitation affect the model's ability to distinguish illicit from legitimate transactions?

### Concept: Class Imbalance and Evaluation Metrics
**Why needed here:** The paper highlights that accuracy (64.93%) masked poor actual performance (7.75% F1, 43.64% AUC). Understanding why accuracy is misleading for imbalanced data and how F1/AUC better reflect model performance is essential for proper evaluation.
**Quick check question:** Why did the synthetic-only model's accuracy of 64.93% mask its poor actual performance, and what does an AUC below 50% (43.64%) indicate about the model's discriminative ability?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map:
Synthetic AML dataset -> Country-level indicators collection -> Feature engineering (country features joined to transactions) -> Heterogeneous graph construction (accounts as nodes, transactions as edges) -> 2-layer RGCN with 16 hidden neurons -> Binary classification output

### Critical Path:
1. Obtain synthetic AML transaction data with origin/destination country fields
2. Collect and preprocess country-level indicators for relevant countries and time periods
3. Join country-level features to transaction nodes based on geographic attributes
4. Construct heterogeneous graph with accounts as nodes, transactions as edges
5. Train RGCN model on hybrid dataset; evaluate against synthetic-only baseline using F1 and AUC

### Design Tradeoffs:
- Privacy vs Utility: Country-level aggregate data provides utility gains without individual privacy concerns but may miss finer-grained regional patterns
- Feature Granularity: Country-level features are easy to obtain but may be too coarse; sub-national features could improve performance but increase complexity
- Model Complexity: 2-layer RGCN is simple and may not capture complex multi-hop schemes; deeper architectures could help but increase overfitting risk
- Temporal Alignment: Country-level indicators from a single year may not match temporal distribution of synthetic transactions

### Failure Signatures:
- Synthetic baseline collapse: AUC <50% with low F1 despite reasonable accuracy indicates model cannot distinguish classes
- Hybrid model overfitting: Large gap between training and validation performance suggests country features are being memorized
- Feature staleness: Performance degrades over time as country-level indicators become outdated
- Geographic coverage gaps: Model performs well for high-volume countries but fails on underrepresented regions

### First 3 Experiments:
1. **Ablation study on country-level features:** Train four separate models, each with one country-level indicator removed, to identify which features drive performance gains
2. **Architecture sensitivity analysis:** Test RGCN depth (1-4 layers) and hidden dimension size (8, 16, 32, 64 neurons) on both synthetic-only and hybrid datasets
3. **Temporal robustness check:** Train on 2022 country-level indicators but evaluate on transactions simulated with different temporal patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Does the inclusion of granular transaction-level edge features (e.g., communication logs, timestamps, or specific transfer methods) yield further performance gains when added to the hybrid dataset? The current study successfully augmented node features but could not test edge features because the underlying synthetic dataset lacks them.

**Open Question 2:** Can GNN architectures designed to sequentially integrate information (accounting for the abstraction mismatch between transaction data and country-level indicators) outperform the standard summation-based aggregation used in this study? The current implementation uses standard summation aggregation which may not fully capture the complex hierarchical relationship between individual transactions and aggregate country statistics.

**Open Question 3:** Can the utility of hybrid datasets be extended to unstructured synthetic data, such as generated text or documents, to improve AML detection? The authors propose exploring unstructured synthetic data including generated text, PDF documents, images, and audio files for training money laundering detection models.

## Limitations
- Limited architectural details prevent exact replication of the study
- Single synthetic dataset source may constrain generalizability to real-world data
- Country-level features are aggregate and may miss institution-specific patterns
- No analysis of temporal robustness or concept drift in the hybrid approach

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** RGCN architecture outperforms traditional ML for AML detection, supported by multiple related papers showing GNNs' effectiveness for financial network anomaly detection
- **Medium Confidence:** Hybrid data approach provides significant utility gains while preserving privacy, though exact mechanisms and implementation details remain underspecified
- **Low Confidence:** The specific performance thresholds (83.39% accuracy, 59.37% F1) can be precisely reproduced without access to the exact synthetic dataset and implementation details

## Next Checks
1. **Feature Ablation Study:** Remove each country-level indicator individually and retrain to quantify each feature's contribution to performance gains
2. **Architecture Sensitivity Analysis:** Systematically vary RGCN depth (1-4 layers) and hidden dimensions (8-64 neurons) to determine if hybrid approach benefits more from increased capacity
3. **Temporal Robustness Test:** Train models on country-level indicators from different years (2020-2022) to assess whether performance degrades as features become outdated relative to evolving money laundering tactics
