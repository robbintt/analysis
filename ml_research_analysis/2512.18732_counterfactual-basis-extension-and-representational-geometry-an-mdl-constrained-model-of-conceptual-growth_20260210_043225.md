core_contribution: The paper formalizes conceptual growth as admissible basis extension
  selected by a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion, where new conceptual dimensions
  arise only through resolution of structured residual error. The central result shows

# Counterfactual Basis Extension and Representational Geometry: An MDL-Constrained Model of Conceptual Growth

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.18732
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18732
- **Authors:** Chainarong Amornbunchornvej
- **Reference count:** 2
- **Key outcome:** The paper formalizes conceptual growth as admissible basis extension selected by a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion, where new conceptual dimensions arise only through resolution of structured residual error.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a formal framework for understanding conceptual growth through the lens of Minimum Description Length (MDL) constrained basis extension. The core insight is that new conceptual dimensions are admitted into a representational system only when they correspond to structured residual error in the current model, not arbitrary novelty. The framework establishes mathematical conditions under which counterfactual reasoning influences learning, showing that internally generated counterfactuals can only affect conceptual development by amplifying or enlarging existing residual structure, not by introducing completely orthogonal novelty. This provides a precise characterization of the relationship between error-driven learning, imagination, and theory change.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a mathematical modeling approach using linear algebra and information theory to formalize conceptual growth as a basis extension problem under MDL constraints. The model represents conceptual knowledge as a linear subspace and new concepts as potential basis extensions. MDL selection is used as the criterion for admitting new conceptual dimensions, where the description length trade-off between model complexity and fit determines whether extensions are accepted. The framework analyzes the geometric relationship between existing conceptual representations, residual error, and potential novelty directions to establish conditions for admissible basis extensions.

## Key Results
- Under MDL selection, new conceptual dimensions must lie entirely within the residual span of prior experience to be admitted
- Extensions orthogonal to the residual span strictly increase description length and are rejected
- Counterfactuals influence learning only by enlarging or amplifying residual structure, not by introducing arbitrary novelty
- Conceptual development is characterized as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works because it formalizes the intuitive principle that learning occurs when existing conceptual systems fail to adequately explain experience. By representing knowledge as a linear subspace and learning as basis extension, the model captures how new concepts emerge from the systematic failure of old ones to account for structured residual error. The MDL criterion provides a principled trade-off between model simplicity and explanatory power, ensuring that new dimensions are only added when they provide sufficient compression of experience to justify their complexity cost. The geometric constraint that new dimensions must lie within residual structure explains why imagination and counterfactual reasoning can facilitate learning but cannot arbitrarily introduce novel concepts - they can only amplify or elaborate on existing systematic failures of understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear Algebra & Subspace Theory**: Understanding how conceptual knowledge can be represented as linear subspaces and how basis extensions work; quick check: verify understanding of span, orthogonal complement, and projection operations
- **Minimum Description Length Principle**: Grasping how MDL balances model complexity against fit to determine optimal representations; quick check: work through a simple MDL comparison between two models of different complexity
- **Information Geometry**: Understanding the relationship between representation spaces and the structure of possible concepts; quick check: map how changes in basis affect description length
- **Residual Analysis**: Comprehending how structured residuals indicate model inadequacy and guide learning; quick check: identify residual structure in a simple linear regression example
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Understanding how imagined scenarios relate to actual experience in shaping conceptual development; quick check: distinguish between counterfactuals that create structured residuals versus arbitrary novelty

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
MDL Criterion -> Basis Extension Selection -> Residual Structure Analysis -> Conceptual Growth

**Critical Path:**
Experience Data → Residual Error Computation → MDL Evaluation → Basis Extension Decision → Updated Conceptual Representation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Linear vs. nonlinear residual modeling (simplicity vs. expressiveness)
- Global vs. local MDL optimization (computational tractability vs. local optima)
- Fixed vs. adaptive description length costs (theoretical purity vs. practical flexibility)
- Abstract vs. domain-specific representation spaces (generality vs. empirical validation)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Accepting orthogonal extensions would indicate MDL criterion implementation errors
- Rejecting all extensions despite clear residual structure suggests overly conservative description length costs
- Conceptual drift without residual correlation indicates breakdown in the error-driven learning assumption

**First Experiments:**
1. Test MDL selection on synthetic datasets with known residual structure to verify theoretical predictions
2. Compare basis extension behavior under varying levels of residual structure complexity
3. Simulate counterfactual reasoning scenarios to validate constraints on imagination's role in learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes linear residual structure and additive error models that may not capture complex conceptual learning
- Does not address discontinuous conceptual shifts or incommensurability between conceptual systems
- Claims about counterfactuals' role depend on untested assumptions about representation space geometry
- Lacks empirical validation against developmental learning datasets or behavioral experiments

## Confidence
- **High**: MDL selection rejecting orthogonal extensions (mathematical proof)
- **Medium**: Characterization of conceptual development as error-driven (theoretical support)
- **Low**: Constraints on imagination's role in learning (abstract claims, no empirical grounding)

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's predictions against developmental learning datasets, examining whether new conceptual dimensions correlate with residual error structure rather than arbitrary novelty
2. Conduct computational simulations varying residual structure complexity to assess model robustness beyond linear assumptions
3. Design behavioral experiments measuring whether imagined scenarios that create structured residuals (versus arbitrary novelty) more effectively promote conceptual change
