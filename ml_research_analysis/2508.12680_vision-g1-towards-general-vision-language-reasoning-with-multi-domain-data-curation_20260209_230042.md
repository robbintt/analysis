# Vision-G1: Towards General Vision Language Reasoning with Multi-Domain Data Curation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.12680
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12680
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Vision-G1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 benchmarks, outperforming similar-sized VLMs and proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash.

## Executive Summary
Vision-G1 introduces a novel approach to vision-language modeling by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance general visual reasoning capabilities. The model addresses the limitations of existing VLMs, which are often constrained to narrow domains, by curating a large, diverse dataset from 46 sources across 8 domains. Through influence-function-based data selection and difficulty-based filtering, Vision-G1-7B demonstrates superior performance on a wide range of benchmarks, showcasing its ability to generalize across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
Vision-G1 employs a multi-domain data curation strategy to create a comprehensive dataset for RL training. The authors use influence-function-based data selection to filter low-quality instances and difficulty-based filtering to match the model's current capability. Multi-round RL training is then performed with a data curriculum to progressively enhance reasoning. This approach enables Vision-G1 to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 17 benchmarks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary VLMs.

## Key Results
- Vision-G1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 benchmarks.
- Outperforms similar-sized VLMs and proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash.
- Demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Vision-G1's success stems from its comprehensive data curation and RL-based training methodology. By curating a diverse dataset from multiple domains, the model is exposed to a wide range of visual reasoning tasks. The influence-function-based data selection and difficulty-based filtering ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, appropriately challenging data. Multi-round RL training with a data curriculum allows the model to progressively improve its reasoning capabilities, leading to superior performance across benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Why needed - to enable the model to learn from feedback and improve its reasoning capabilities. Quick check - evaluate the model's performance on RL-specific benchmarks.
- **Data Curation**: Why needed - to ensure the model is trained on diverse, high-quality data. Quick check - assess the diversity and quality of the curated dataset.
- **Influence-Function-Based Selection**: Why needed - to filter out low-quality instances and focus on informative data. Quick check - analyze the impact of this selection method on model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data Curation -> Influence-Function-Based Selection -> Difficulty-Based Filtering -> Multi-Round RL Training
- **Critical Path**: The critical path involves curating a diverse dataset, selecting high-quality instances, filtering based on difficulty, and performing multi-round RL training to enhance reasoning capabilities.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The tradeoff between dataset diversity and model complexity is crucial. A more diverse dataset may require a more complex model, but it also enhances generalization.
- **Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include overfitting to specific domains or underperforming on out-of-distribution tasks due to biases in the curated dataset.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate the impact of data diversity on model performance. 2) Assess the effectiveness of influence-function-based selection. 3) Test the model's robustness on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The influence-function-based data selection method and difficulty-based filtering strategy are not fully detailed, making it difficult to assess their individual contributions to performance gains.
- The specific nature and diversity of the 17 benchmarks are not thoroughly described, raising questions about the robustness of the model's generalization capabilities.
- The paper does not address potential biases introduced by the curated dataset or the impact of domain-specific data on the model's reasoning abilities in out-of-distribution scenarios.

## Confidence
- **Performance Claims**: Medium - While the reported performance improvements are promising, the lack of detailed methodological transparency and the absence of ablation studies reduce confidence in attributing success solely to the proposed approach.
- **Comparison with Proprietary Models**: Medium - The comparison with proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash is challenging to validate without access to these models or standardized evaluation protocols.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (influence-function-based selection, difficulty-based filtering, and multi-round RL) to the overall performance gains.
2. Evaluate Vision-G1 on additional out-of-distribution benchmarks to assess its robustness and generalization beyond the curated domains.
3. Perform a detailed error analysis to identify potential biases or failure modes introduced by the curated dataset and the RL training process.
