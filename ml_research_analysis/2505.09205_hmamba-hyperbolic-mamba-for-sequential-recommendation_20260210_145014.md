# HMamba: Hyperbolic Mamba for Sequential Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.09205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09205
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 3-11% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines with 3.2× faster training

## Executive Summary
HMamba introduces a novel framework that combines hyperbolic geometry with Mamba's selective state space models for sequential recommendation. The core innovation lies in applying hyperbolic embeddings to capture hierarchical relationships in user-item interactions while maintaining Mamba's computational efficiency. The framework achieves 3-11% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets, with 3.2× faster training speeds compared to attention-based models.

## Method Summary
HMamba processes sequential recommendation data through curvature-aware discretization and stabilized Riemannian operations. The framework employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture hierarchical relationships inherent in user-item interactions, while leveraging Mamba's selective state space mechanism for efficient sequence processing. Two variants are proposed: HMamba-Full for complete hyperbolic optimization and HMamba-Half as a hybrid approach combining hyperbolic and Euclidean representations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3-11% improvement in recommendation accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines
- Maintains 3.2× faster training speeds compared to attention-based models
- Demonstrates superior sample efficiency requiring only N samples for 𝜖-approximation guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The combination of hyperbolic geometry and Mamba's selective state space models enables efficient capture of hierarchical relationships in sequential data. Hyperbolic embeddings naturally represent tree-like structures common in recommendation systems, where items and users exhibit parent-child relationships. The Mamba architecture provides computational efficiency through selective state spaces, avoiding the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms while maintaining expressive power for long-range dependencies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyperbolic geometry**: Non-Euclidean space where distances expand exponentially, ideal for representing hierarchical data structures
  - *Why needed*: Traditional Euclidean embeddings struggle with tree-like data structures common in recommendation systems
  - *Quick check*: Verify that distances between hierarchically related items are preserved in hyperbolic space

- **Mamba selective state spaces**: Mechanism for efficient sequence modeling that selectively processes information
  - *Why needed*: Avoids attention's quadratic complexity while maintaining ability to model long-range dependencies
  - *Quick check*: Confirm that state space discretization preserves critical temporal relationships

- **Riemannian optimization**: Optimization techniques for curved spaces that maintain geometric constraints
  - *Why needed*: Standard optimization methods don't account for hyperbolic space curvature
  - *Quick check*: Validate that gradients respect hyperbolic manifold constraints during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Curvature-Aware Discretization -> Hyperbolic Embedding Layer -> Mamba Blocks -> Prediction Layer

**Critical Path**: The curvature-aware discretization layer is crucial as it determines how hierarchical relationships are mapped into hyperbolic space, directly impacting downstream model performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances representation quality (hyperbolic geometry) with computational efficiency (Mamba). The hybrid HMamba-Half variant trades some representation power for easier optimization and training stability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor hierarchical capture manifests as degraded performance on datasets with clear tree-like structures. Training instability often indicates issues with Riemannian operations or curvature parameter selection.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate hyperbolic embedding quality on synthetic hierarchical data before applying to real recommendation datasets
2. Compare performance of HMamba-Full versus HMamba-Half on datasets with varying hierarchy strength
3. Test training stability across different curvature parameters to find optimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Theoretical sample complexity analysis assumes idealized conditions that may not hold with real-world noisy data
- Computational efficiency claims lack ablation studies isolating hyperbolic geometry versus Mamba contributions
- Riemannian operation overhead in curvature-aware discretization not fully accounted for in complexity analysis

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Empirical results showing 3-11% improvement over baselines are well-supported by experimental data across four datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims of establishing a "new paradigm" for hierarchical sequential modeling require broader community validation.

**Medium Confidence**: Computational efficiency claims depend on specific hardware configurations and implementation details not fully disclosed.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating contributions of hyperbolic geometry versus Mamba's selective state space mechanism
2. Test framework on datasets with varying levels of hierarchical structure to validate advantages
3. Perform stress tests on training stability of curvature-aware discretization with different sequence lengths and data distributions
