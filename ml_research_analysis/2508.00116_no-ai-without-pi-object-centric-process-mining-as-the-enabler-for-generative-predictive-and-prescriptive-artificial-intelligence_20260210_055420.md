# No AI Without PI! Object-Centric Process Mining as the Enabler for Generative, Predictive, and Prescriptive Artificial Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00116
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00116
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) is the essential integration layer that grounds AI models in real-world operational processes by providing structured, multi-object event data.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Process Intelligence (PI) as the critical integration of Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address the challenge of applying AI effectively in industrial settings focused on end-to-end operational processes. While AI has made significant advances, organizations struggle to ground these techniques in real-world process contexts due to fragmented data and oversimplified case-centric models. OCPM provides the missing link by offering system-agnostic, object-centric event data that accurately reflects complex, multi-object processes. This enables AI to be applied meaningfully across generative, predictive, and prescriptive forms, allowing organizations to uncover bottlenecks, predict issues, and prescribe optimal actions.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework demonstrating five key connections between OCPM and AI. The method involves transforming fragmented enterprise data into Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) that links events to multiple object types, then applying AI techniques to this structured context. For predictive AI, process diagnostics (bottlenecks, deviations) are mapped to supervised learning targets. For generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) connects natural language queries to process intelligence. For prescriptive AI, mathematical optimization is applied to process models. The approach is demonstrated conceptually through examples and figures rather than empirical experiments.

## Key Results
- OCPM provides the necessary structured context that allows AI models to interpret complex, cross-functional operational processes
- Process mining acts as a translation layer converting abstract process problems into supervised machine learning tasks
- Generative AI combined with RAG can democratize access to process intelligence by translating natural language queries into process analytics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) provides the necessary structured context ("grounding") that allows AI models to interpret complex, cross-functional operational processes.
- **Mechanism:** Traditional process mining forces events into a single "case" (e.g., an order ID), which distorts reality when multiple objects (orders, items, customers) interact. OCPM captures these many-to-many relationships in Object-Centric Event Data (OCED). By structuring data this way, predictive and generative models gain access to features representing the actual state of the system (e.g., how a delay in *packaging* affects a specific *customer's* *invoice*), allowing them to learn causal dependencies rather than correlations based on fragmented views.
- **Core assumption:** The paper assumes that the "rigid case notion" of traditional mining is the primary barrier preventing AI from understanding end-to-end processes, and that structured OCED is sufficient to bridge this gap.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different forms of AI."
  - [section 3] "In reality, case-centricity is very limiting... OCPM starts from Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) where events can reference multiple objects of different types."
  - [corpus] Weak direct support; neighbors focus on specific applications (e.g., insurance automation) rather than validating OCPM as a universal AI enabler.
- **Break condition:** If source systems are too fragmented or data quality is too poor to map events to objects consistently, the OCED structure will fail to provide the required grounding, rendering the AI insights unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Process mining acts as a translation layer that converts abstract process problems (e.g., "bottlenecks") into supervised machine learning tasks.
- **Mechanism:** Process mining engines identify specific occurrences of process failures (deviations, delays). The paper suggests these identified instances serve as labeled training data. For example, every time a process passes through a bottleneck, the system records the context as input features ($X$) and the resulting delay as the target ($Y$). This transforms a diagnostic process question into a predictive function $f$ that AI can learn.
- **Core assumption:** Process mining diagnostics are accurate enough to generate high-quality "ground truth" labels for training predictive models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4] "For any process related problem, we can create training examples... and derive the corresponding function using machine learning."
  - [section 4] "Figure 3 illustrates how OCPM helps to create the context required for AI... after discovering process models... it is possible to create... machine learning problems."
  - [corpus] Paper 'ProCause' discusses generating outcomes for prescriptive monitoring, implicitly supporting the link between process data and ML training.
- **Break condition:** If the process is highly unstructured or ad-hoc (no repeatable model), the "translation" of process state to fixed features $X$ becomes inconsistent, preventing effective model training.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Generative AI (GenAI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can democratize access to process intelligence by translating natural language queries into process analytics.
- **Mechanism:** Large Language Models (LLMs) possess reasoning capabilities but lack private enterprise data. The paper proposes a RAG architecture where the LLM retrieves specific facts from the OCED and process models. The LLM acts as a natural language interface, converting user questions into queries against the process mining engine and synthesizing the retrieved data into coherent answers, thereby lowering the technical barrier to insight.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM is capable of reliably understanding the schema of the process mining engine and mapping natural language intents to specific performance or compliance metrics.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2] "RAG solves this by grounding the model’s responses in retrieved facts... combining two mechanisms: (1) retrieval... and (2) generation."
  - [section 4] "GenAI can be used to make interactions between process mining software and humans easier... [using] the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach."
  - [corpus] Paper 'AI-Enhanced Business Process Automation' supports the synergy of LLMs and OCPM in specific domains like insurance.
- **Break condition:** If the LLM "hallucinates" a metric or misinterprets the OCED schema, it provides confident but incorrect insights, breaking user trust.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Object-Centric Event Data (OCED)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the architectural core of the paper. Unlike traditional logs where one row = one case, OCED links one event to multiple objects (e.g., "Payment" links to "Order" and "Supplier"). Understanding this is required to grasp how the "single source of truth" is built.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why an event like "Goods Receipt" cannot be uniquely assigned to a single "Order" ID in a complex supply chain?

- **Concept: The "Smartphone Paradox" in Enterprise AI**
  - **Why needed here:** This explains the *why* of the paper—the gap between consumer AI hype and enterprise reality. It frames the problem not as a lack of AI algorithms, but as a lack of structured operational context.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper argue that GenAI currently only "optimizes the edges" of work rather than transforming the core?

- **Concept: Predictive vs. Prescriptive AI**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper distinguishes learning a function $f(x) \approx y$ (Predictive) from optimizing a goal under constraints (Prescriptive). You must distinguish these to implement the correct backend logic (ML training vs. Mathematical Optimization/OR).
  - **Quick check question:** If a system suggests re-routing a delivery truck to avoid traffic, is this predictive or prescriptive AI?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Source Layer (Fragmented systems: ERP, CRM) -> Data Layer (Object-Centric Event Data storage in OCEL 2.0 format) -> Intelligence Layer (Process Mining Engine + AI Models) -> Interface Layer (GenAI + RAG)

- **Critical path:** Extracting and transforming raw data into **Object-Centric Event Data**. Without this "single source of truth," the process models are distorted, and the AI has no reliable ground truth for prediction.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - *Flexibility vs. Complexity:* OCPM allows analyzing any perspective (order, item, customer) but requires significantly more complex data modeling than traditional case-centric logs.
  - *Accuracy vs. Explainability:* Prescriptive AI (optimization) gives clear "best" actions but may be rigid; Predictive AI (ML) handles nuance better but offers probabilities rather than guaranteed optimal decisions.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **The "Spaghetti Model" Effect:** If object relations are not filtered correctly, OCPM models become unreadable, causing GenAI summarizations to fail.
  - **RAG Disconnect:** The LLM invents a process metric (e.g., "average cycle time") that does not exist in the data or misinterprets the context, leading to confident lies.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Data Transformation:** Select one sub-process (e.g., Procure-to-Pay). Extract data into an OCED format (OCEL), ensuring events link to at least two object types (e.g., Purchase Order & Material).
  2. **Supervised Prediction:** Use the OCED log to train a basic regressor. Target feature: Throughput time. Input features: Object attributes and previous event paths. Verify if multi-object context improves accuracy over a case-only model.
  3. **RAG Integration:** Connect a generic LLM to your OCED metadata schema. Ask it a natural language question ("Where are the bottlenecks for Material X?") and verify if it correctly retrieves the relevant process definition or performance indicator.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can Generative AI reliably automate the transformation of heterogeneous, proprietary data schemas into standardized Object-Centric Event Data (OCED)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while OCPM simplifies extraction, "research on this topic is limited" and there remains a need to "bridge the gap between the specifics of proprietary data formats and OCED."
- Why unresolved: Current data extraction remains a manual bottleneck, and while LLMs show promise (e.g., in SQL generation), a systematic AI-driven methodology for mapping complex legacy systems to OCEL standards is missing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of an AI-driven ETL pipeline that autonomously maps raw source system data to OCEL 2.0 format with high fidelity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent can Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigate hallucinations in natural language process querying compared to standalone LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author states that sending textually encoded process variants to GenAI results in answers that are "not very reliable," suggesting RAG as the necessary solution.
- Why unresolved: It is currently unclear how to effectively structure process mining computations and OCED metadata for retrieval to ensure the LLM generates factually grounded answers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks comparing the accuracy of RAG-enhanced process queries against standard LLM prompts on complex object-centric datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective machine learning feature encoding strategies for multi-relational Object-Centric Event Data (OCED)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that while process data for predictive AI is "often tabular," OCED fragments may also be represented as graphs, implying the optimal encoding method is non-trivial and unsettled.
- Why unresolved: Standard predictive models assume flat, case-centric tables; they struggle with the complexity of events interacting with multiple object types simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of predictive model performance when trained on flattened OCED tables versus graph-based neural network representations.

## Limitations
- The paper presents conceptual connections rather than empirical validation or measured outcomes
- The RAG integration mechanism is described but not demonstrated with actual user queries or accuracy metrics
- The claim that OCED structure alone provides sufficient grounding for AI models oversimplifies data quality challenges in fragmented enterprise systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: OCPM provides more accurate representations of complex processes than case-centric approaches (supported by established process mining literature)
- **Medium confidence**: OCPM can enable predictive AI through structured feature extraction (plausible but untested in the paper)
- **Low confidence**: Generative AI with RAG can reliably democratize process intelligence (no empirical validation provided)

## Next Checks
1. **Data Quality Test**: Extract OCED from a real enterprise system and measure the percentage of events that can be successfully mapped to multiple object types. If >30% of events cannot be linked to object hierarchies, the foundational data structure fails.

2. **Predictive Accuracy Comparison**: Train identical ML models using (a) traditional case-centric features and (b) OCED features. Measure performance difference on a concrete prediction task (e.g., delay prediction). A <5% accuracy improvement would challenge the claimed value proposition.

3. **RAG Hallucination Audit**: Implement the proposed RAG system and systematically test it with 50 natural language queries about process metrics. Calculate the hallucination rate (incorrect answers presented with confidence). An error rate >15% would indicate the integration is not production-ready.
