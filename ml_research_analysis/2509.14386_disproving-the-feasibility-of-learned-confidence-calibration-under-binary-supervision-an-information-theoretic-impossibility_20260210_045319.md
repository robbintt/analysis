# Disproving the Feasibility of Learned Confidence Calibration Under Binary Supervision: An Information-Theoretic Impossibility

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.14386
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14386
- **Authors**: Arjun S. Nair; Kristina P. Sinaga
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Key outcome**: Neural networks cannot simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful diversity when trained using only binary correct/incorrect supervision.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a fundamental impossibility theorem showing that neural networks cannot simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful diversity when trained using only binary correct/incorrect supervision. The authors prove this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a methodological limitation, demonstrating that binary supervision lacks sufficient information to distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions. Through comprehensive experiments spanning negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration methods, the paper reveals universal failure patterns and establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary rather than merely convenient.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes an information-theoretic impossibility theorem proving that binary supervision cannot enable neural networks to learn both well-calibrated confidence estimates and meaningful confidence diversity simultaneously. The authors analyze three training paradigms: negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration methods. They demonstrate that binary supervision fundamentally lacks the information required to distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions, leading to either extreme underconfidence or collapsed confidence distributions. The analysis is validated through extensive experiments across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, examining calibration error, confidence diversity, and failure patterns across different training methodologies.

## Key Results
- Binary supervision produces universal failure patterns: negative rewards cause extreme underconfidence (ECE > 0.8) while destroying confidence diversity (std < 0.05)
- Symmetric losses fail to escape binary signal averaging, preventing meaningful confidence learning
- Post-hoc calibration achieves calibration (ECE < 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution, not through genuine confidence learning
- Real-world validation shows 100% failure rate for all training methods, while post-hoc calibration's 33% success rate confirms the theorem

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper proves that binary supervision creates an information-theoretic barrier where correct/incorrect feedback cannot distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions. This fundamental constraint forces networks to either collapse confidence distributions or produce unreliable estimates. The mechanism operates at the level of information theory, making it independent of specific architectures, optimization methods, or training procedures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information theory basics**: Understanding entropy and mutual information is crucial for grasping why binary supervision lacks sufficient information. Quick check: Calculate mutual information between binary labels and continuous confidence scores.
- **Confidence calibration metrics**: ECE (Expected Calibration Error) and confidence diversity measures are essential for evaluating results. Quick check: Compute ECE on a simple binary classification problem.
- **Neural network training dynamics**: Understanding how supervision signals propagate through training is important for interpreting failure modes. Quick check: Trace gradient flow for binary cross-entropy loss.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Binary supervision -> Confidence prediction -> Calibration evaluation -> Information-theoretic analysis

**Critical Path**: The core constraint flows from binary supervision through the learning process to the inability to achieve both calibration and diversity, with post-hoc methods providing an alternative path through transformation rather than learning.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The fundamental tradeoff is between calibration quality and confidence diversity - improving one necessarily degrades the other under binary supervision. Post-hoc methods trade genuine confidence learning for calibration through distribution transformation.

**Failure Signatures**: Extreme underconfidence (high ECE, low confidence diversity) with negative rewards; binary averaging with symmetric losses; confidence distribution compression with post-hoc calibration.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train a simple binary classifier with negative reward and measure ECE and confidence diversity
2. Apply post-hoc calibration to a trained model and compare pre/post distributions
3. Test symmetric loss functions on a synthetic dataset with known confidence structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper proposes novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental limitations without requiring human confidence annotations. These approaches remain theoretical suggestions requiring empirical validation to determine their effectiveness in circumventing binary supervision constraints.

## Limitations
- Analysis focuses exclusively on binary classification settings, leaving open questions about multi-class extensions
- Experimental scope tested only three standard datasets with relatively simple architectures
- Assumes perfect optimization of the learning objective, which may not reflect practical training dynamics

## Confidence
- **Information-theoretic impossibility proof**: High
- **Experimental validation on tested datasets**: High
- **Generalizability to complex vision tasks and language models**: Medium
- **Effectiveness of proposed ensemble disagreement approaches**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the impossibility theorem on multi-class classification problems to determine if class structure provides additional information for calibration
2. Apply the theoretical framework to large-scale vision datasets (ImageNet) and language models to assess scalability of the constraints
3. Empirically validate the proposed ensemble disagreement and multi-agent learning approaches to determine if they can circumvent the binary supervision limitations
