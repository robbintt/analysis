# Languages in Multilingual Speech Foundation Models Align Both Phonetically and Semantically

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19606
- Reference count: 28
- This paper investigates whether cross-lingual alignment in multilingual speech foundation models relies on semantic or phonetic cues.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether cross-lingual alignment in multilingual speech foundation models relies on semantic or phonetic cues. The authors propose SeqSimInterp, a method to interpret spoken translation retrieval by analyzing word-level alignments, and conduct controlled experiments using a challenge set devoid of pronunciation-similar pairs. Results show that retrieval accuracy remains high even without phonetic shortcuts, and word pairs identified by SeqSimInterp are semantically similar. Early exiting experiments reveal that intermediate encoder layers preserve more phonetic detail, which improves zero-shot speech recognition accuracy in seven low-resource languages, especially those with transparent orthographies. Speech translation training is found to enhance semantic cross-lingual alignment compared to models trained only on speech recognition.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces SeqSimInterp, a method that extends sequence similarity (SeqSim) for spoken translation retrieval by inferring word-level alignments through dynamic time warping on cross-attention weights. The method extracts center-frame embeddings for words and matches them bidirectionally using cosine similarity to identify semantically equivalent word pairs across languages. To isolate semantic alignment from phonetic shortcuts, the authors create a challenge set by filtering the FLEURS dataset to remove proper nouns and pronunciation-similar pairs. Early exiting experiments pass intermediate encoder states directly to the decoder to evaluate phonetic preservation for zero-shot ASR on low-resource languages. The study compares models trained with speech recognition (ASR) versus speech translation (ST) objectives to assess the impact on cross-lingual alignment.

## Key Results
- Retrieval accuracy remains high (8-26% on challenge sets) even when phonetic shortcuts like cognates are removed, indicating semantic alignment.
- Word pairs identified by SeqSimInterp show significantly higher semantic similarity than random pairs (p<0.001), validating the method's interpretability.
- Early exiting at intermediate encoder layers improves zero-shot ASR accuracy in low-resource languages, with larger gains for languages with transparent orthographies (e.g., 56.8% CER reduction for Kyrgyz at layer 24).
- Speech translation training enhances semantic cross-lingual alignment compared to ASR-only training, achieving 27-39% retrieval on distant pairs versus 0-2% for ASR-only models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Speech Translation Training Induces Semantic Cross-Lingual Alignment
- Claim: Models trained with speech translation objectives develop stronger semantic alignment across languages than models trained only on ASR.
- Mechanism: The X→English translation task forces the encoder to map semantically equivalent utterances to similar representations, creating a shared semantic subspace that supports retrieval even between typologically distant languages.
- Core assumption: The translation supervision signal provides explicit cross-lingual semantic grounding that ASR alone cannot induce.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Speech translation training is found to enhance semantic cross-lingual alignment compared to models trained only on speech recognition."
  - [section 6, Table 7-8]: OWSM Small (with ST training) achieves 27-39% retrieval on distant pairs vs. OWSM Small Low-Restriction (ASR-only) dropping to 0-2% on challenge sets.
  - [corpus]: Related work (POTSA, Parallel Tokenizers) similarly finds explicit cross-lingual supervision improves semantic alignment, though these focus on text/LLM settings.
- Break condition: If a model shows high retrieval on challenge sets without any translation training, this mechanism would not explain the alignment.

### Mechanism 2: Phonetic Detail Decays Hierarchically Across Encoder Layers
- Claim: Earlier encoder layers retain more segmental phonetic information, which can be exploited via early exiting for zero-shot ASR on unsupported languages.
- Mechanism: The encoder progressively abstracts from acoustic/phonetic representations toward language-agnostic semantic features; intermediate layers offer a "sweet spot" with usable phonetic fidelity.
- Core assumption: Languages with transparent orthographies and typological proximity to supported languages benefit most from phonetic-level representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Early exiting experiments reveal that intermediate encoder layers preserve more phonetic detail, which improves zero-shot speech recognition accuracy in seven low-resource languages."
  - [section 5.2.2, Table 6]: Kyrgyz achieves 56.8% CER reduction (layer 24), Javanese 10.3% CER reduction (layer 3); transparent-orthography languages show larger gains.
  - [corpus]: MauBERT demonstrates articulatory feature supervision improves cross-lingual phonetic representation—consistent with phonetic information being exploitable at certain representational levels.
- Break condition: If early exiting consistently worsens ASR across all languages, the phonetic decay hypothesis fails.

### Mechanism 3: Pronunciation-Level Cues Inflate But Do Not Fully Explain Retrieval
- Claim: Phonetic shortcuts (cognates, loanwords, proper nouns) boost retrieval scores, but semantic alignment persists even when these are controlled.
- Mechanism: Models leverage both acoustic similarity shortcuts and genuine semantic representations; removing shortcuts reveals the true semantic capacity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show that retrieval accuracy remains high even without phonetic shortcuts."
  - [section 5.1, Table 3]: Full test set retrieval 30-48% drops to 8-26% on challenge set for distant pairs, but remains substantially above random.
  - [section 5.1, Table 4]: SeqSimInterp word pairs show significantly higher semantic similarity than random baselines (p<0.001 across all pairs).
  - [corpus]: Corpus evidence on this specific mechanism is weak—no direct comparator papers controlling for phonetic shortcuts in speech retrieval were found.
- Break condition: If challenge set retrieval drops to random baseline, semantic alignment would be falsified.

## Foundational Learning

- **Cross-attention for timestamp inference**: The paper uses dynamic time warping on cross-attention weights to infer word-level timestamps.
  - Why needed here: SeqSimInterp requires knowing which frames correspond to which words; cross-attention provides this without external alignment tools.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why center-frame embeddings (rather than mean-pooled word embeddings) better preserve word identity?

- **Logit lens / early exiting for interpretability**: Projecting intermediate encoder states through the decoder reveals layer-wise predictions.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how representations evolve from phonetic to semantic requires inspecting intermediate outputs, not just final predictions.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean when earlier layers produce phonetically-plausible but semantically-wrong translations (e.g., "affettano" for "affect")?

- **SeqSim as a retrieval metric**: Frame-level bidirectional maximum similarity matching for sequence comparison.
  - Why needed here: This paper extends SeqSim with interpretability; understanding the base metric is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Why does SeqSim outperform mean pooling for spoken translation retrieval (per prior work)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  - Audio -> mel-spectrogram -> conv layers -> encoder layers (0→31) -> decoder -> transcription/translation
  - For early exit: intermediate encoder layer L -> decoder -> transcription (phonetically biased)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Audio → mel spectrogram → conv layers → encoder layers (0→31)
  2. For standard inference: final encoder layer → decoder → transcription/translation
  3. For early exit: intermediate encoder layer L → decoder → transcription (phonetically biased)
  4. For SeqSimInterp: encoder embeddings → center-frame extraction → cross-lingual frame matching → word-level alignment

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Early layer exit: Better for phonetic fidelity on low-resource languages; worse for semantic tasks on supported languages
  - Speech translation training: Improves cross-lingual alignment but requires parallel ST data (10% of Whisper's 680K hours)
  - Challenge set evaluation: More controlled but smaller sample sizes (67-110 pairs vs. 427 full test)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Near-zero challenge set retrieval → model relies entirely on phonetic shortcuts; lacks semantic alignment
  - Early exit WER >100% → layer too shallow; insufficient phonetic abstraction
  - SeqSimInterp matches random baseline → retrieval not semantically grounded

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate challenge set retrieval: Filter FLEURS for proper nouns using spaCy, manually remove remaining phonetic pairs; compare R@1 on full vs. challenge sets.
  2. Layer-wise early exit on one low-resource language: Extract encoder outputs at layers 0, 8, 16, 24, 32; decode and compute CER/WER to find optimal layer.
  3. SeqSimInterp validation: Apply to a language pair, extract mutually-aligned word pairs, compute LaBSE similarity scores; run paired t-test vs. random word pairs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Do cross-lingual alignment patterns (phonetic vs. semantic) and layer-wise representation shifts generalize to speech foundation models with different architectures, such as SeamlessM4T?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly state in the Limitations section: "it may be interesting compare whether our findings hold also for speech foundation models of different architectures, such as SeamlessM4T."
- **Why unresolved:** The study is restricted to the Whisper and OWSM families (encoder-decoder), which may exhibit specific layer-wise behaviors not present in other architectures.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Applying the SeqSimInterp method and pronunciation-controlled retrieval experiments to architectures like SeamlessM4T to observe if translation training induces similar semantic subspaces.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does the semantic capacity of self-supervised speech models improve significantly when evaluated on utterance-level inputs rather than isolated words?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that their results "suggest it to be worthwhile to revisit the degree of semantic knowledge in self-supervised speech models with utterance-level data. We leave such an investigation to future work."
- **Why unresolved:** Prior work relied on isolated words which lack context; this paper suggests context aids Whisper's semantic alignment, but it remains unknown if this applies to self-supervised models.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Probing self-supervised models using the proposed SeqSimInterp method on full utterances to see if semantic equivalence contributions increase compared to word-level baselines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can interpretability methods be adapted to capture complex, one-to-many cross-lingual semantic mappings rather than relying solely on one-to-one bidirectional matches?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors admit a methodological limitation: "SeqSimInterp is only able to capture word-level matches between languages, whereas empirically cross-lingual semantic mappings may be one-to-many."
- **Why unresolved:** The current method forces a strict bidirectional alignment of the "best" matching frames, potentially missing valid semantic links where a single concept maps to multiple words.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Developing a softer alignment metric that allows a single source frame to correlate with multiple target frames without a strict mutual exclusivity constraint.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** Does the phonetic preservation in intermediate encoder layers consistently improve zero-shot ASR for low-resource languages with non-transparent (deep) orthographies?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The authors observe that early exiting improves accuracy "particularly for languages with transparent orthographies," leaving the efficacy for opaque orthographies less certain.
- **Why unresolved:** The gains seen in languages like Javanese might stem from their phonemic consistency; it is unclear if early exiting helps when the relationship between sound and spelling is irregular.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Early exit experiments on a diverse set of low-resource languages specifically selected for having deep or irregular orthographies.

## Limitations

- The manual filtering process for challenge sets may not be exhaustive, potentially leaving residual phonetic shortcuts.
- SeqSimInterp depends on accurate word-level timestamp inference via cross-attention DTW, but implementation details are not fully specified.
- Early exiting benefits are primarily observed for languages with transparent orthographies, with unclear efficacy for opaque orthographies.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Speech translation training enhances semantic cross-lingual alignment compared to ASR-only models. Phonetic detail decays hierarchically across encoder layers. Pronunciation-level cues inflate but do not fully explain retrieval accuracy.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism that translation supervision provides explicit cross-lingual semantic grounding. The claim that transparent orthographies benefit most from early exiting. The SeqSimInterp method reliably extracts semantically similar word pairs.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific implementation of cross-attention DTW for timestamp inference. The explanation for why certain low-resource languages benefit more from early exiting than others.

## Next Checks

1. **Challenge Set Filtering Validation**: Re-run the challenge set creation with two independent annotators filtering proper nouns and pronunciation-similar pairs, then compute inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa) to quantify filtering reliability and ensure no residual phonetic shortcuts remain.

2. **Layer-Wise Phonetic Decay Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments varying encoder depth (layers 0, 8, 16, 24, 32) on a typologically diverse subset of languages, measuring not just WER/CER but also phoneme-level error rates to directly quantify phonetic fidelity preservation at each layer.

3. **Semantic Alignment Robustness Test**: Apply SeqSimInterp to language pairs with varying degrees of linguistic distance (e.g., English-French, English-Mandarin, English-Japanese) and compute semantic similarity distributions for aligned words, comparing against baselines to verify semantic alignment strength correlates with linguistic proximity.
