# From Vision To Language through Graph of Events in Space and Time: An Explainable Self-supervised Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04815
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel GEST framework generates rich, story-like video descriptions by constructing explainable spatio-temporal event graphs, validated on diverse datasets with strong performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for generating rich, natural language descriptions of videos by constructing a Graph of Events in Space and Time (GEST). The method leverages multiple vision tasks—object detection, action recognition, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation—to extract frame-level information and build a global representation of video events. GEST captures spatio-temporal relationships between events, which are then converted into a proto-language and refined using a text-only large language model (LLM) to produce coherent, story-like descriptions.

The approach is validated on diverse datasets (Videos-to-Paragraphs, COIN, WebVid, VidOR, ImageNet-VidVRD) and shows strong performance, particularly on Videos-to-Paragraphs, which contains complex, multi-actor videos. Human evaluations and VLM-as-a-Jury rankings consistently prefer GEST-generated descriptions over state-of-the-art methods like VidIL, VALOR, and others. The method also demonstrates effectiveness in a self-supervised teacher-student framework, improving the performance of end-to-end video captioning models. Overall, GEST provides an explainable, grounded, and effective solution for video-to-language generation, addressing limitations in current datasets and evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
GEST processes videos by first extracting frame-level information using four vision models: VideoMAE for action detection, YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking, Mask2Former for semantic segmentation, and Marigold for depth estimation. The outputs are filtered and aggregated to construct a spatio-temporal graph where nodes represent events (actions performed by actors with associated objects) and edges capture spatial and temporal relationships. A proto-language is generated from this graph using a procedural grammar that groups events by actor and temporal order, then refined by an LLM with context from a scene classifier. The method also supports a teacher-student framework where GEST-generated descriptions are used to pre-train end-to-end models.

## Key Results
- GEST outperforms state-of-the-art methods (VidIL, VALOR, etc.) on Videos-to-Paragraphs dataset in human evaluations and VLM-as-a-Jury rankings
- Human evaluations show GEST descriptions are preferred for richness (rank 1.57) and factual correctness (rank 1.33) on Videos-to-Paragraphs
- Self-supervised pre-training with GEST improves end-to-end model performance (VALOR: CIDEr 21.51→27.87, all metrics improved)
- GEST successfully transfers to multiple datasets (COIN, WebVid, VidOR, ImageNet-VidVRD) with consistent performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining multiple vision tasks through explicit spatio-temporal event graphs produces more grounded video descriptions than end-to-end latent-space approaches.
- Mechanism: Each frame is processed by four vision models (action detection via VideoMAE, object detection/tracking via YOLO, semantic segmentation via Mask2Former, depth via Marigold). Outputs are filtered using IOU thresholds (≥0.1 for actor-object interaction), depth thresholds (≤25% difference), and temporal voting windows (11 frames, ≥5 occurrences). Events are then linked via spatial proximity (centroid-distance-to-diagonal ratio) and temporal ordering to form GEST.
- Core assumption: Explicit symbolic representations of events preserve more interpretable, controllable information than learned latent embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverages multiple vision tasks—object detection, action recognition, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation—to extract frame-level information and build a global representation of video events"
  - [Section 4.1] "for each frame in a given video, we first extract this information followed by a matching and aggregation step... objects that are not in the proximity of the person are discarded"
  - [corpus] "TimeSearch" confirms that "downsampling long videos in either space or time can lead to visual hallucination"
- Break condition: If individual vision models produce low-confidence outputs (action < 0.75) or tracking inconsistencies exceed re-identification capacity (HSV cosine similarity < 0.3), the graph fragments and descriptions miss actors or events.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A structured "proto-language" intermediate representation enables more faithful LLM refinement than direct video-to-text generation.
- Mechanism: GEST nodes are temporally sorted and grouped by actor; a procedural grammar generates textual descriptions with explicit spatial/temporal connectors. The LLM is prompted with candidate object lists and permitted to select, replace, or reject them based on context, rather than generating from scratch.
- Core assumption: LLMs are stronger at language refinement than grounded visual reasoning; providing explicit visual evidence reduces hallucination.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "converted into a proto-language and refined using a text-only large language model (LLM) to produce coherent, story-like descriptions"
  - [Section 4.2] "we decide to not make a hard decision when selecting the possible objects involved... feeding them with special instructions for selecting the most probable object in the given context"
  - [corpus] Limited corpus support; related work focuses on end-to-end transformer architectures rather than intermediate symbolic representations
- Break condition: If proto-language is too verbose (many candidate objects) or action vocabulary is limited (VideoMAE's fixed action set), the LLM may infer plausible-but-incorrect details.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GEST-generated pseudo-labels can serve as effective pre-training signal for end-to-end neural models.
- Mechanism: The modular GEST pipeline generates descriptions for unlabeled videos; an end-to-end student model is pre-trained on these pseudo-labels, then fine-tuned on human annotations. This bridges the scarcity of rich paragraph-level ground truth.
- Core assumption: GEST descriptions, despite imperfections, contain sufficient semantic correctness to provide useful learning signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "demonstrates effectiveness in a self-supervised teacher-student framework, improving the performance of end-to-end video captioning models"
  - [Section 6.8] Table 8 shows VALOR pre-trained on GEST descriptions improves on all 7 metrics (e.g., CIDEr 21.51→27.87)
  - [corpus] "SF2T: Self-supervised Fragment Finetuning" supports self-supervised approaches for video-LLM improvement
- Break condition: If GEST descriptions contain systematic biases (e.g., limited action vocabulary), student models may inherit these gaps; transfer effectiveness depends on domain overlap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Scene Graphs and Video Scene Graphs
  - Why needed here: GEST extends scene graphs from static images to spatio-temporal video; understanding nodes (events/objects) and edges (relationships) is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: How does a video scene graph represent temporal relationships that an image scene graph cannot?

- Concept: Multi-task Vision Pipeline Fusion
  - Why needed here: GEST requires integrating outputs from four vision tasks with confidence thresholds, spatial filtering, and temporal aggregation.
  - Quick check question: Given a person bounding box and multiple object detections, how would you filter to only objects likely being interacted with?

- Concept: Knowledge Distillation with Noisy Teachers
  - Why needed here: The teacher-student framework uses imperfect GEST outputs as training signal; understanding when noisy supervision helps vs. harms is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why might pre-training on machine-generated labels help even when they contain errors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Video → Vision Encoders (VideoMAE, YOLO, Mask2Former, Marigold) → Frame-level Aggregation (IOU/depth/voting filters) → Person Unification (short-term IOU + long-term HSV re-id) → Event Construction (temporal aggregation) → GEST (nodes + spatial/temporal edges) → Proto-language (grammar-based) → LLM (context + refinement)

- Critical path: Person unification and actor-object association are most fragile—errors cascade into wrong actor counts and hallucinated interactions. HSV re-identification (threshold 0.3) handles tracker failures; depth filtering (< 25%) prevents associating background objects.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - All frames vs. sampling: GEST processes every frame (complete but costly); VidIL samples 4 frames (fast but misses events)
  - Fixed vs. open vocabulary: GEST uses VideoMAE's action set (grounded but limited); VidIL uses CLIP/BLIP (flexible but hallucination-prone)
  - Symbolic intermediate vs. end-to-end: More interpretable and controllable, but requires careful prompt engineering

- Failure signatures:
  - Single-actor description for multi-actor video: Check person re-id threshold and tracker consistency
  - Missing obvious actions: Check confidence threshold (0.75) and voting window parameters
  - Hallucinated objects: Check depth threshold and proto-language object list size
  - Trivial/short descriptions: Check LLM prompt emphasis on richness and context prepending

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation on Videos-to-Paragraphs: Remove semantic segmentation → rank drops from 1.57 to 3.66 (Table 7)
  2. Self-supervised pre-training: VALOR with GEST pre-training improves all metrics vs. direct fine-tuning (Table 8)
  3. VLM-as-Jury correlation: VLM ensemble shows 81% agreement with humans vs. ~70% for BERTScore (Table 4)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How can the field develop or identify datasets specifically designed for rich, story-like video descriptions rather than simple enumerations of short captions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "There is a clear need for datasets appropriate for such rich narrative descriptions, to move away from the rather simplistic video captioning."
- **Why unresolved:** Current datasets (e.g., COIN, WebVid) are biased toward short captions or single-activity classification, lacking the complex, multi-actor narrative annotations required to train and validate models for long-form description.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The creation and adoption of a benchmark dataset where annotations are paragraph-length narratives with overlapping, complex spatio-temporal interactions, distinct from current captioning benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Performance on instructional datasets (COIN, WebVid) is moderate compared to Videos-to-Paragraphs, indicating potential generalization gaps
- GEST's performance is bounded by the accuracy of its component vision models, with errors propagating through the pipeline
- The fixed grammar for generating proto-language may limit the richness of descriptions and how well it captures complex temporal relationships

## Confidence
- GEST produces more grounded descriptions than end-to-end methods (High): Supported by consistent human rankings and VLM-as-a-Jury evaluations
- Self-supervised pre-training with GEST improves end-to-end models (Medium): Demonstrated on VALOR but limited to one architecture
- GEST provides explainable intermediate representations (High): The graph construction and proto-language generation are fully specified and verifiable

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset robustness test**: Evaluate GEST on datasets with different characteristics (egocentric videos, surveillance footage, or datasets with more than two actors) to identify failure patterns and generalization limits
2. **Vision model failure analysis**: Systematically degrade individual vision model performance (add noise to depth maps, perturb action confidences, corrupt tracking) and measure impact on final description quality
3. **Proto-language grammar ablation**: Replace the fixed grammar with alternative generation strategies (template-based vs. rule-based, different temporal ordering schemes) and measure impact on both human and VLM evaluation metrics
