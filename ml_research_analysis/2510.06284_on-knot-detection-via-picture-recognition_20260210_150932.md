# On knot detection via picture recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06284
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Image-to-invariant pipeline combining CNNs/transformers with Jones polynomial computation achieves ~99% accuracy on crossing number prediction for small knots (≤10 crossings).

## Executive Summary
This work proposes an image-first pipeline for knot recognition, combining modern machine learning (CNNs and transformers) with traditional invariant computation (Jones polynomial). The key innovation is to first detect and classify knot diagrams from images, then compute topological invariants for final classification. The authors present baselines predicting crossing number from images, showing lightweight CNN and transformer architectures achieve ~99% accuracy on small knots (≤10 crossings). The approach exploits the observation that most observed knots in images are small, where invariants are highly effective.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a perception-symbolic factorization approach where neural networks convert skeletonized knot diagram images into symbolic representations (currently crossing counts, future PD codes), which are then processed by invariant computation algorithms. They evaluate three architectures: a 6-layer MLP (Vanilla), a 5-layer CNN, and a 3-stage CvT transformer. All models use MSE loss for regression to crossing number, with training on 7,240 images and testing on 1,811 images from the Prideout SVG knot dataset. The CNN achieves 99.94% accuracy while the CvT achieves 99.83%, both significantly outperforming the Vanilla baseline at 98.23%.

## Key Results
- CNN architecture achieves 99.94% accuracy on crossing number prediction from skeletonized knot images
- CvT transformer achieves 99.83% accuracy, requiring more epochs and memory than CNN
- Vanilla MLP baseline achieves only 98.23% accuracy, demonstrating importance of spatial inductive bias
- Small knots (≤10 crossings) dominate observed distributions, making invariant computation feasible

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: The Small-Knot Prior
Physical constraints and selection effects ensure most observed knots are small, limiting the search space for classifiers and ensuring invariants remain highly distinctive and fast to compute.

### Mechanism 2: Perception-Symbolic Factorization
Neural networks convert visual data into clean symbolic representations, isolating learning errors to the perception stage and avoiding the complexity of directly computing invariants from pixel statistics.

### Mechanism 3: Spatial Inductive Bias for Junction Geometry
CNNs and transformers exploit local geometric structure of crossings, using convolutional kernels or attention to detect and count local features effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- **Planar Diagram (PD) Code**: Intermediate representation bridging visual and algebraic worlds by encoding knot diagrams as labeled crossings. Quick check: Given a crossing where edges 1, 2, 3, 4 meet counterclockwise, how would you represent it if edge 1 is the incoming lower strand?

- **Reidemeister Moves**: Equivalence class definitions that recognition systems must be invariant to for correct classification. Quick check: Why does a purely local texture classifier fail to distinguish a complex unknot diagram from a genuine knot?

- **Jones Polynomial**: Quantum invariant serving as ground truth for knot type in the final pipeline stage. Quick check: Why is computing the Jones polynomial from a PD code feasible for small knots but complexity-theoretically hard in general?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 512x512 Skeletonized Image -> CNN/CvT Backbone -> Linear Head -> Scalar (Crossing Count)
- **Critical path**: Translation of visual junctions to discrete labels, where a single error "flips the knot type"
- **Design tradeoffs**: CNN more efficient and accurate for crossing counts; CvT requires more epochs but may be necessary for full PD reconstruction. Regression (MSE) vs classification preferred to penalize wild errors less harshly.
- **Failure signatures**: Vanilla MLP shows "little interpretable structure" and fails to generalize; CvT has memory overflow risks requiring batch size reduction.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate CNN baseline to verify ~99% accuracy on crossing number. 2) Test CNN on non-skeletonized drawings to measure fragility. 3) Train over/under classifier on single crossing patches to estimate theoretical error bounds.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can neural networks be trained to robustly output complete Planar Diagram presentations from raw images rather than just crossing counts? The paper describes this as future work but provides no experimental validation.

### Open Question 2
Do transformer-based architectures outperform CNNs on PD reconstruction, even if CNNs are superior for crossing counts? The paper suggests self-attention may be better for global consistency but has not tested this.

### Open Question 3
How robust are these models to domain shifts like hand-drawn sketches or real microscopy images? The paper warns of expected performance drops but provides no empirical evaluation.

## Limitations
- The small-knot prior assumption breaks for polymer simulations or high-complexity knots where invariant computation becomes intractable
- The skeletonization pre-processing pipeline is fragile to domain shifts and not systematically evaluated for robustness
- No quantitative bounds provided for error propagation from image to PD code in the perception-symbolic factorization

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: CNN/CvT architectures achieving ~99% accuracy on crossing number prediction from skeletonized diagrams
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that most observed knots are small, lacking empirical validation across diverse domains
- **Low Confidence**: Feasibility of full pipeline (image → PD code → Jones polynomial → knot type) remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate trained CNN on non-skeletonized line drawings with varying thickness to quantify domain shift performance degradation
2. Measure over/under crossing classification error rate on isolated patches, then propagate through PD reconstruction to estimate error bounds
3. Test perception pipeline on knots with 15-20 crossings to verify graceful accuracy degradation and identify practical upper bounds
