# Scaling Laws for Robust Comparison of Open Foundation Language-Vision Models and Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04598
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04598
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: MaMMUT consistently outperforms CLIP across compute scales, with better sample efficiency and scalability

## Executive Summary
This study establishes a systematic framework for comparing open foundation language-vision models through scaling law derivation. The approach enables robust, reproducible model and dataset comparisons across wide ranges of compute scales and downstream tasks, avoiding misleading conclusions from single-reference-point evaluations. The researchers demonstrate that MaMMUT architecture exhibits superior scalability and sample efficiency compared to CLIP, with performance crossover occurring between 10^10 and 10^11 GFLOPs. The study also validates that constant learning rate schedules can achieve equivalent comparison trends with 98% less compute, making large-scale model comparisons more accessible.

## Method Summary
The study introduces a systematic approach for comparing open foundation language-vision models using scaling law derivation. Researchers conduct dense measurements across model sizes (ViT-S to ViT-H), sample counts (1.28M to 3B), and tasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, and segmentation. The method involves training CLIP and MaMMUT architectures on three open datasets (DataComp-1.4B, Re-LAION-1.4B, DFN-1.4B) and analyzing performance scaling across different compute regimes. The approach enables identification of consistent performance patterns and critical crossover points between architectures, while demonstrating that constant learning rate schedules can achieve the same comparison trends with significantly reduced compute requirements.

## Key Results
- MaMMUT consistently outperforms CLIP across compute scales with better sample efficiency
- DFN-1.4B consistently yields superior results across both models and tasks
- Performance crossover between MaMMUT and CLIP occurs between 10^10 and 10^11 GFLOPs
- Constant learning rate schedules achieve equivalent comparison trends with 98% less compute

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The scaling law approach works by systematically measuring model performance across a dense grid of compute scales, model sizes, and sample counts. This comprehensive measurement strategy captures the full performance landscape, enabling accurate identification of scaling patterns and critical transition points. The method's robustness comes from avoiding single-reference-point evaluations that can lead to misleading conclusions, instead providing a complete picture of how different architectures and datasets perform across the entire feasible training range.

## Foundational Learning
- Scaling laws in machine learning: Understanding how model performance scales with compute, parameters, and data is essential for predicting performance at untested scales and making informed architecture decisions
- Quick check: Verify that performance follows power-law relationships across the measured range

- Zero-shot learning evaluation: Critical for assessing model generalization without task-specific fine-tuning, providing a standardized comparison metric
- Quick check: Ensure evaluation datasets are diverse and representative of real-world use cases

- Compute-efficient training schedules: Understanding how different learning rate schedules affect convergence and final performance enables resource optimization
- Quick check: Compare convergence curves under different scheduling approaches

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data -> Encoder (ViT-S/H) -> Multi-modal projection -> MLP heads -> Downstream tasks
Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Model forward pass -> Loss computation -> Parameter updates -> Checkpoint saving
Design tradeoffs: Larger models provide better absolute performance but require more compute; smaller models offer better efficiency but may miss complex patterns
Failure signatures: Training instability at extreme scales, overfitting on smaller datasets, poor generalization to unseen tasks
First experiments: 1) Verify basic training pipeline with small dataset and model, 2) Test scaling relationship on single architecture-dataset pair, 3) Validate zero-shot evaluation pipeline on known benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Focus on three open datasets may not represent the full landscape of language-vision model training data
- Analysis assumes scaling laws remain valid across all tested conditions, but potential nonlinearities at extreme scales could affect extrapolation reliability
- Limited to two primary architectures (CLIP and MaMMUT), potentially missing important patterns from other model families

## Confidence
- High confidence: MaMMUT demonstrates superior sample efficiency and scalability compared to CLIP within tested compute and sample ranges
- High confidence: DFN-1.4B consistently outperforms other datasets across architectures and tasks
- Medium confidence: Constant learning rate approach achieves equivalent comparison trends with significantly reduced compute, though broader validation needed
- Medium confidence: Crossover point between MaMMUT and CLIP occurring between 10^10 and 10^11 GFLOPs, as this represents extrapolation from tested range

## Next Checks
1. Validate scaling law predictions by training MaMMUT and CLIP at predicted crossover compute point (10^10-10^11 GFLOPs) to confirm extrapolation accuracy
2. Test constant learning rate scheduling approach across additional architectures beyond CLIP and MaMMUT to verify general applicability
3. Evaluate relative performance of compared models on proprietary datasets not included in the study to assess generalization of scaling law conclusions
