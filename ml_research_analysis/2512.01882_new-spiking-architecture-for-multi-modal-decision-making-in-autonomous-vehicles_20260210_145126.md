# New Spiking Architecture for Multi-Modal Decision-Making in Autonomous Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.01882
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01882
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces a spiking temporal-aware ternary attention mechanism for energy-efficient multi-modal autonomous driving

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-modal reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving that integrates camera, LiDAR, and IMU data through a cross-attention transformer module. The authors address the computational challenges of deploying transformer-based models on edge devices by proposing a spiking neural network approach with temporal-aware ternary attention, which replaces expensive multiplication operations with event-driven, energy-efficient computation. Experimental results in the Highway-Env platform demonstrate that the multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal baselines, while the spiking variant achieves comparable performance to non-spiking models with improved energy efficiency as indicated by 40% higher spike sparsity.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a multi-modal reinforcement learning framework that fuses data from three sensor modalities (camera, LiDAR, and IMU) using a cross-attention transformer module. To address the high computational cost of transformers in edge environments, they introduce a spiking temporal-aware ternary attention mechanism that performs event-driven computation without multiplication operations. The framework processes temporal sequences of multi-modal observations to make driving decisions, with the spiking variant designed to reduce computational activity while maintaining performance. Experiments are conducted in the Highway-Env platform to evaluate both the multi-modal approach and the efficiency benefits of the spiking architecture.

## Key Results
- Multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal baselines in autonomous driving tasks
- Spiking model with temporal-aware attention achieves comparable performance to non-spiking models
- Performance gap between spiking and non-spiking models narrows to 15% while achieving 40% higher spike sparsity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The spiking temporal-aware ternary attention mechanism works by leveraging event-driven computation that only activates neurons when meaningful input changes occur, rather than processing every timestep uniformly. This approach exploits the temporal sparsity inherent in sensor data and driving scenarios, reducing unnecessary computations. The ternary attention mechanism replaces costly floating-point multiplications with simpler operations, enabling efficient hardware implementation on neuromorphic processors. The cross-attention transformer effectively fuses complementary information from multiple sensor modalities, with each modality contributing unique spatial and temporal features that enhance decision-making robustness.

## Foundational Learning
**Multi-modal sensor fusion**: Combining complementary information from different sensor types (camera for visual context, LiDAR for depth, IMU for motion) improves robustness and accuracy in perception and decision-making. *Why needed*: No single sensor modality captures all relevant environmental information for safe autonomous driving. *Quick check*: Compare performance of single-modal vs multi-modal baselines.

**Spiking neural networks**: Event-driven computation where neurons only activate when membrane potential crosses threshold, reducing unnecessary calculations. *Why needed*: Enables energy-efficient processing suitable for edge deployment where power and computational resources are limited. *Quick check*: Measure spike sparsity and compare to traditional neural network activity levels.

**Temporal-aware attention mechanisms**: Attention mechanisms that incorporate temporal dynamics to weight inputs based on their relevance across time sequences. *Why needed*: Autonomous driving requires understanding both spatial relationships and temporal patterns in sensor data for safe decision-making. *Quick check*: Evaluate performance with and without temporal awareness in attention.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Sensor data (Camera, LiDAR, IMU) → Multi-modal Feature Extractor → Cross-Attention Transformer → Spiking Temporal-aware Ternary Attention → Action Selection

**Critical path:** Sensor input → Feature extraction → Cross-modal attention fusion → Spiking attention computation → Policy output

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for slight performance degradation compared to non-spiking models (15% gap), but gains significant energy savings through event-driven computation and ternary operations.

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation in complex urban scenarios, reduced effectiveness in adverse weather conditions, and potential loss of fine-grained spatial details during ternary quantization.

**First experiments:**
1. Implement ablation study comparing multi-modal performance with individual sensor modalities
2. Test spiking model on neuromorphic hardware to measure actual energy consumption and latency
3. Evaluate performance in extended driving scenarios including urban environments and pedestrian interactions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to simulation environment (Highway-Env) without real-world testing
- Energy efficiency claims lack direct hardware validation and power consumption measurements
- Spiking approach still shows 15% performance gap compared to non-spiking models

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core multi-modal reinforcement learning framework design and its superiority over single-modal baselines is well-established through simulation experiments.

**Medium confidence:** The proposed spiking temporal-aware ternary attention mechanism's computational efficiency benefits are supported by spike sparsity metrics, though lack of hardware validation limits certainty.

**Low confidence:** The claimed energy efficiency improvements without direct power measurements or edge device implementation make these claims the least substantiated.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the spiking model on an actual edge computing platform (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson or Loihi) to measure real-world energy consumption and latency
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each modality (camera, LiDAR, IMU) to performance to validate the claimed benefits of multi-modal fusion
3. Test the framework in more complex driving scenarios including urban environments, pedestrian interactions, and adverse weather conditions to assess robustness beyond highway settings
