# BIG5-TPoT: Predicting BIG Five Personality Traits, Facets, and Items Through Targeted Preselection of Texts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.09426
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09426
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** TPoT improves Big Five personality prediction accuracy by semantically filtering text input before regression modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting Big Five personality traits, facets, and individual survey items from large volumes of text. The authors introduce a targeted preselection of texts (TPoT) strategy that semantically filters input text to improve personality prediction performance. TPoT computes semantic similarity scores between sentences and survey items, using a weighted average of relevant sentences as input to regression models. The approach is evaluated on the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset with 5,810 essays, demonstrating improvements across multiple metrics compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The TPoT approach works by first splitting input text into sentences, then computing semantic similarity scores between each sentence and all survey items. These similarity scores are used to weight sentences, with the top-ranked sentences averaged to create a filtered input representation. This representation is then fed into regression models for personality prediction. The method is tested across three prediction tasks: predicting broad personality traits (the Big Five), predicting finer-grained facets, and predicting individual survey items through ordinal regression. The semantic similarity computation uses a sentence embedding model to capture the relationship between text content and personality assessment items.

## Key Results
- TPoT reduces MAE from 0.515 to 0.503 for openness trait prediction and from 0.628 to 0.608 for negative emotionality
- Accuracy improves from 0.550 to 0.560 for openness and from 0.471 to 0.481 for negative emotionality trait prediction
- For facet prediction, MAE improves from 0.512 to 0.502 (openness) and 0.625 to 0.606 (negative emotionality)
- The model trained to predict individual items via ordinal regression shows the best overall performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TPoT improves personality prediction by focusing the model on text segments most semantically relevant to personality assessment items. By computing similarity scores between sentences and survey items, the method effectively filters out irrelevant content and amplifies signals that are more likely to correlate with personality traits. The weighted averaging of top-ranked sentences creates a condensed representation that captures the most personality-relevant information while reducing noise from unrelated text content.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic similarity computation:** Measures relationship between text segments and personality items; needed to identify relevant content; quick check: verify similarity scores correlate with prediction accuracy
- **Sentence embedding models:** Convert text into vector representations for similarity comparison; needed for semantic filtering; quick check: test different embedding models for impact on performance
- **Weighted averaging of text segments:** Combines top-ranked sentences based on similarity scores; needed to create focused input representation; quick check: vary the number of sentences included to find optimal balance
- **Ordinal regression for item prediction:** Models ordered categorical personality responses; needed for detailed personality assessment; quick check: compare ordinal vs. standard regression performance
- **Regression modeling for personality traits:** Maps text representations to continuous personality scores; needed for trait prediction; quick check: test different regression algorithms for best performance
- **Text segmentation into sentences:** Enables fine-grained semantic analysis; needed for precise relevance filtering; quick check: compare sentence vs. paragraph-level processing

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text corpus -> Sentence segmentation -> Semantic similarity computation -> Weighted averaging -> Regression model -> Personality prediction

**Critical Path:** The semantic similarity computation between each sentence and all survey items represents the most computationally intensive step, followed by weighted averaging of top sentences, then regression prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational efficiency for improved prediction accuracy. While computing similarity scores for every sentence-item pair is expensive, the resulting focused input representation significantly improves prediction performance compared to using all available text.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate: insufficient semantic similarity between text and survey items, inappropriate weighting of sentences, or regression model limitations in capturing personality-text relationships.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test TPoT with varying numbers of top-ranked sentences (5, 10, 20) to find optimal balance between information retention and noise reduction
2. Compare different sentence embedding models (BERT, RoBERTa, sentence-BERT) to assess impact on semantic similarity computation
3. Evaluate TPoT performance on different text types (social media, essays, interviews) to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a single dataset (Stream of Consciousness Essays) with limited sample size of 5,810 essays
- Semantic similarity computation creates computational overhead that scales poorly with larger item sets
- Potential biases in semantic similarity scores from language model limitations or domain mismatch

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** TPoT improves prediction accuracy over baseline models on the tested dataset
- **Medium confidence:** Semantic filtering through TPoT is more effective than using all available text
- **Medium confidence:** Ordinal regression on individual items yields the best performance

## Next Checks
1. Test TPoT on diverse text corpora beyond essays, including social media posts, interview transcripts, and professional communications
2. Compare computational efficiency and prediction quality against alternative text selection methods such as TF-IDF weighting or attention-based filtering
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal number of top-ranked sentences for input, examining how performance varies with different semantic similarity thresholds
