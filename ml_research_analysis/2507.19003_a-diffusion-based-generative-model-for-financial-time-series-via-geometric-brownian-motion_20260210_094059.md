core_contribution: This paper proposes a diffusion-based generative model for financial
  time series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM) into the forward noising
  process. Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic
  numerical sequences, this method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at
  each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series.

# A diffusion-based generative model for financial time series via geometric Brownian motion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.19003
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19003
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** GBM-based diffusion model reproduces financial stylized facts more realistically than conventional methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel diffusion-based generative model for financial time series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM) principles into the forward noising process. The key innovation lies in injecting noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, which better captures the heteroskedastic nature of financial markets compared to standard score-based diffusion models. By balancing drift and diffusion terms, the model reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation compatible with existing score-based generative frameworks. The approach leverages a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the CSDI framework and demonstrates superior performance in reproducing key financial stylized facts including heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect.

## Method Summary
The proposed method modifies the standard diffusion process by incorporating GBM principles, where noise injection scales proportionally with asset prices at each time step. This price-dependent noise injection creates a heteroskedastic diffusion process that better reflects real financial market dynamics. The forward noising process is carefully designed to maintain compatibility with score-based generative modeling frameworks by ensuring the resulting log-price process follows a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation. The reverse-time generative process is trained using denoising score matching with a Transformer-based architecture, specifically adapted from the CSDI framework. This combination allows the model to capture complex temporal dependencies while maintaining the statistical properties characteristic of financial time series.

## Key Results
- Reproduces heavy-tailed return distributions with tail exponents closer to empirical values (3.06-4.62 vs. 8.49-8.96 for baseline methods)
- Better captures long-range volatility dependence and asymmetric correlation structure characteristic of financial markets
- Successfully models volatility clustering and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by aligning the noise injection process with the fundamental properties of financial markets. Standard diffusion models treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, ignoring the multiplicative nature of financial returns. By incorporating GBM principles, the noise injection scales proportionally with asset prices, creating a heteroskedastic process that naturally generates the heavy-tailed distributions observed in financial returns. The variance-exploding SDE formulation ensures compatibility with score-based generative modeling while preserving the multiplicative structure essential for realistic financial modeling.

## Foundational Learning
- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):** Why needed - provides the theoretical foundation for price-dependent noise injection; Quick check - verify that returns follow log-normal distribution
- **Variance-Exploding SDEs:** Why needed - enables compatibility with score-based generative models; Quick check - confirm explosion at infinity preserves score estimation
- **Heteroskedasticity:** Why needed - captures time-varying volatility characteristic of financial markets; Quick check - test for ARCH effects in generated samples
- **Score-based generative modeling:** Why needed - provides framework for training the reverse diffusion process; Quick check - validate score estimation accuracy at multiple noise levels
- **Transformer architectures:** Why needed - handles long-range dependencies in temporal data; Quick check - assess attention pattern stability across training epochs
- **Financial stylized facts:** Why needed - defines success criteria for realistic market simulation; Quick check - compare tail exponents and volatility clustering measures

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Price data -> GBM noise injection -> Variance-exploding SDE -> Transformer denoising network -> Generated samples

**Critical path:** The forward noising process (GBM-based) -> Variance-exploding SDE formulation -> Transformer-based score estimation -> Reverse diffusion generation

**Design tradeoffs:** Price-proportional noise injection vs. computational complexity; variance-exploding vs. variance-preserving SDEs; Transformer depth vs. training stability

**Failure signatures:** Poor tail exponent reproduction indicates inadequate noise scaling; missing volatility clustering suggests insufficient temporal modeling; symmetric correlations indicate broken leverage effect capture

**First experiments:**
1. Generate synthetic returns and compute tail exponent distribution across multiple noise scales
2. Measure autocorrelation of absolute returns to verify volatility clustering
3. Calculate cross-correlation between returns and future volatilities to test leverage effect

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation lacks specification of exact datasets, time periods, and number of assets used
- Model's generalization to out-of-sample periods and different asset classes remains unverified
- No discussion of computational efficiency, training stability, or real-world deployment considerations

## Confidence

**High confidence** in mathematical framework: The derivation connecting GBM to variance-exploding SDEs and integration with score-based generative modeling appears theoretically sound.

**Medium confidence** in empirical claims: Lack of detailed experimental setup and statistical significance testing limits strength of claims about stylized fact reproduction.

**Low confidence** in practical applicability: No assessment of computational requirements, training stability, or performance on high-frequency data or during extreme market conditions.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments using multiple independent datasets spanning different market regimes (bull, bear, crisis periods) and asset classes (equities, commodities, currencies) to assess robustness and generalizability.

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify specific contribution of GBM-based noise injection versus Transformer architecture, including comparisons with alternative sequence modeling approaches.

3. Perform out-of-sample forecasting experiments to evaluate whether generated samples improve upon baseline methods for practical tasks like risk management, portfolio optimization, or option pricing.
