# IELTS Writing Revision Platform with Automated Essay Scoring and Adaptive Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24460
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24460
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Transformer-based automated scoring (MAE 0.666, R² 0.354) with adaptive feedback produced modest but significant score improvements (+0.060 IELTS bands, p = 0.011) in IELTS writing preparation.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of providing personalized, rubric-aligned feedback for IELTS writing preparation, where traditional methods lack real-time, adaptive support. Through iterative Design-Based Research cycles, the authors developed a platform integrating a DistilBERT transformer model with regression head for automated essay scoring and adaptive feedback. Early rule-based approaches showed mid-band compression and poor accuracy (MAE 1.27, negative R²). Cycle 4's transformer model significantly improved performance (MAE 0.666, R² 0.354, Pearson r 0.601), enabling Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation. Statistical testing revealed modest but significant score improvements (+0.060 IELTS bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504). Conservative surface-level corrections proved more reliable than aggressive structural interventions, suggesting automated feedback is best used as a supplement to human instruction in IELTS preparation contexts.

## Method Summary
The platform uses a hybrid DistilBERT architecture combining pretrained language embeddings with manually extracted linguistic features (word count, sentence length, lexical diversity, punctuation density). Essays are tokenized (max 256 tokens), encoded through DistilBERT, and concatenated with features before passing through a linear regression head. Training used AdamW optimizer (lr=1.5e-5, weight_decay=0.02), dropout=0.35, gentle label smoothing, and partial encoder layer freezing. The Kaggle IELTS Writing Scored Essays Dataset (~1,500 essays) was split 70/15/15 for training/validation/testing. Adaptive feedback generation prioritizes weaknesses based on predicted band score gaps across IELTS rubric criteria (Task Achievement, Coherence/Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range/Accuracy).

## Key Results
- Transformer model significantly outperformed rule-based approaches: MAE 0.666 vs 1.27, R² 0.354 vs negative, Pearson r 0.601
- Adaptive feedback produced statistically significant score improvements (+0.060 IELTS bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504)
- Conservative surface-level corrections were more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for score improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Transformer-based models with regression heads outperform rule-based AES systems for IELTS essay scoring. DistilBERT learns contextualized embeddings from tokenized essays, concatenated with manually extracted linguistic features (word count, sentence length, lexical diversity). A linear regression head maps this hybrid representation to continuous band scores, preserving ordinal relationships while capturing semantic complexity that rule-based systems miss. This works because pre-trained language representations transfer effectively to the IELTS domain despite limited training data (~1,200 essays).

### Mechanism 2
Rubric-aligned adaptive feedback produces statistically significant score improvements when paired with accurate automated scoring. The AES model identifies linguistic feature deviations from IELTS rubric criteria (GRA, LR, CC, TA). Feedback generation algorithms prioritize weaknesses based on predicted band score gaps. Learners apply targeted corrections, and the rescoring loop validates improvement—operationalizing a closed-loop DBR cycle. This works because learners possess sufficient meta-cognitive skill to interpret and apply feedback without instructor mediation.

### Mechanism 3
Separating conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface reduces cognitive load and improves task focus. The chatbot handles onboarding and task selection in a low-stakes conversational flow, then transitions users to a distraction-free writing environment with minimal UI elements. This compartmentalization prevents split-attention effects described in cognitive load theory, preserving working memory for writing task execution. This works because ESL learners benefit from explicit task decomposition and reduced interface complexity during high-stakes practice.

## Foundational Learning

- **IELTS Writing Rubric (TA, CC, LR, GRA)**: Why needed here: The entire scoring and feedback system is anchored to these four criteria. Without understanding how examiners assess Task Achievement, Coherence/Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range/Accuracy, you cannot interpret model outputs or debug feedback relevance. Quick check question: Can you explain why a band 7.0 essay might score higher on GRA than on CC?

- **Transformer Fine-Tuning with Regression Heads**: Why needed here: Cycle 4's success depends on understanding how DistilBERT embeddings combine with handcrafted features, how label smoothing and dropout prevent overfitting, and why regression (not classification) preserves ordinal scoring properties. Quick check question: Why does the paper use a regression head instead of 9-way classification for band prediction?

- **Design-Based Research (DBR) Cycles**: Why needed here: The entire methodology uses iterative DBR cycles (1-5) to diagnose failures and refine components. Understanding DBR helps you read the results as cumulative evidence rather than isolated experiments. Quick check question: What specific failure in Cycle 3 motivated the architectural shift in Cycle 4?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User onboarding (chatbot) -> Task selection -> Writing interface submission -> DistilBERT scoring -> Feature extraction -> Adaptive feedback generation -> Sidebar/modal display -> Revision resubmission -> Rescoring

- **Critical path**: User onboarding (chatbot) → Task selection → Writing interface submission → DistilBERT scoring → Feature extraction → Adaptive feedback generation → Sidebar/modal display → Revision resubmission → Rescoring. Latency at the scoring/feedback stage is the bottleneck.

- **Design tradeoffs**: DistilBERT chosen over full BERT for speed/efficiency; trades some accuracy for responsiveness. Hybrid model (embeddings + handcrafted features) vs. pure neural approach; increases complexity but improves generalization on limited data. Three-attempt limit reduces NLP load but may frustrate learners seeking unlimited practice. Chatbot guidance vs. pure writing interface; reduces initial friction but adds transition complexity.

- **Failure signatures**: Mid-band compression (predictions cluster at 6.0-6.5 regardless of actual quality). Higher-band underprediction (essays at 8.0-9.0 systematically scored lower). Feedback backfire (P4 coherence-focused revisions decreased scores). Negative R² (model performs worse than mean-prediction baseline).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce Cycle 4 scoring metrics on the Kaggle IELTS dataset (MAE, R², Pearson/Spearman) to validate your DistilBERT implementation before any modifications. 2) Run inference latency benchmarks on the full pipeline (submission → score → feedback) to identify whether async queue processing meets interactive response thresholds (<2 seconds target). 3) Test persona-based revision simulation (P1-P5) on a held-out essay set to verify that surface-level corrections reliably outperform structural interventions—confirming the paper's key pedagogical finding before deploying to users.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Long-term learning transfer**: Does the platform facilitate long-term learning transfer when used by actual IELTS candidates? The authors state that "challenges remain" and that "future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates" rather than the simulated personas used in Cycle 5.

- **Specific rubric component effectiveness**: Which specific IELTS writing rubric components (e.g., Lexical Resource vs. Coherence) contribute most significantly to score improvements? The Discussion notes that "experiments that break down individual IELTS feedback writing components... could reveal which factors most significantly enhanced IELTS scores."

- **Higher-band essay modeling**: Can the model architecture be refined to eliminate the underprediction of higher-band essays (7.5–9.0)? Despite the switch to a transformer model, the results and visual analysis indicate the model still struggles with "underpredictions in the higher band ranges (7.5–9.0)."

## Limitations
- Moderate R² (0.354) indicates substantial unexplained variance in scoring predictions despite improved performance over rule-based approaches
- Feedback effectiveness varies significantly by revision strategy type, with aggressive structural interventions sometimes backfiring
- Evaluation on 30 held-out essays represents a limited sample size for generalizing real-world impact

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Transformer model outperforms rule-based approaches (MAE 0.666 vs 1.27, clear statistical separation); adaptive feedback produces modest but significant score improvements (+0.060 bands, p=0.011); interface separation reduces cognitive load (theoretical grounding established)
- **Medium confidence**: Specific performance thresholds (R² 0.354, Pearson 0.601) would benefit from external validation; feedback effectiveness varies by strategy type but mechanisms aren't fully explained
- **Low confidence**: Generalization to diverse IELTS populations; long-term learning impact beyond single-session improvements; optimal balance between automated and human feedback

## Next Checks
1. **External dataset validation**: Test the hybrid DistilBERT model on independent IELTS datasets (e.g., IELTS official practice materials, other Kaggle datasets) to assess generalizability and identify systematic biases in scoring predictions
2. **Longitudinal learning impact**: Conduct multi-session studies tracking the same learners over 4-6 weeks to measure whether adaptive feedback effects compound or diminish with repeated use
3. **Human-AI complementarity study**: Compare learner outcomes when using the platform alone versus when paired with instructor guidance, measuring which feedback types benefit most from human mediation
