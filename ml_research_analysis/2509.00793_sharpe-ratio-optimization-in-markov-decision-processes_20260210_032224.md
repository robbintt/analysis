# Sharpe Ratio Optimization in Markov Decision Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.00793
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00793
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Novel dynamic programming approach for Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs using Dinkelbach's transform and policy iteration algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of Sharpe ratio optimization in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which involves maximizing the risk-adjusted return ratio while accounting for variance-related risk metrics. The authors develop a novel dynamic programming approach that transforms the ratio-form objective into a sequence of mean-squared-variance (M2V) optimizations using Dinkelbach's transform. They propose policy iteration algorithms (SRPI and SRPI+) that iteratively solve these M2V problems to find the optimal policy, with proven convergence to the global optimum and monotonic improvement in Sharpe ratio.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle the Sharpe ratio optimization problem in MDPs by first applying Dinkelbach's transform to linearize the ratio objective, converting it into a sequence of M2V optimization subproblems. They then develop policy iteration algorithms that iteratively solve these M2V problems: starting from an initial policy, they compute the value function, update the policy based on the Bellman optimality condition for the M2V objective, and repeat until convergence. The SRPI+ variant includes additional refinements for improved computational efficiency. The algorithms are designed to guarantee monotonic improvement in Sharpe ratio and converge to the globally optimal policy.

## Key Results
- Novel dynamic programming approach for Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs using Dinkelbach's transform
- Policy iteration algorithms (SRPI and SRPI+) with proven convergence to global optimum
- Monotonic improvement in Sharpe ratio guaranteed during iterations
- Numerical experiments demonstrate improved computational efficiency compared to theoretical bounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging Dinkelbach's transform to convert the non-linear ratio optimization into a sequence of linear M2V problems that can be solved using dynamic programming. This transformation allows the use of policy iteration methods that iteratively improve the policy by solving Bellman optimality equations for the M2V objective. The monotonic improvement guarantee ensures that each iteration increases the Sharpe ratio, leading to convergence at the optimal policy.

## Foundational Learning
1. Dinkelbach's algorithm (why needed: to linearize ratio objectives; quick check: verify transformation correctness)
2. Mean-squared-variance (M2V) optimization (why needed: to handle risk-sensitive objectives; quick check: confirm convexity properties)
3. Policy iteration methods (why needed: to iteratively improve policies; quick check: validate Bellman equation solutions)
4. Sharpe ratio in MDPs (why needed: to quantify risk-adjusted performance; quick check: test with known benchmarks)
5. Dynamic programming for ratio optimization (why needed: to solve complex MDP objectives; quick check: compare with brute-force methods)
6. Bellman optimality conditions (why needed: to guide policy improvement; quick check: verify optimality equations)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Initial policy -> Dinkelbach iteration -> M2V subproblem -> Policy update -> Convergence check -> Optimal policy
Critical path: Policy initialization → M2V optimization → Policy improvement → Value function update → Convergence test
Design tradeoffs: Theoretical guarantees vs. computational complexity; exact solutions vs. approximation methods; model-based vs. model-free approaches
Failure signatures: Non-convergence due to poor initialization; oscillations in policy updates; divergence in value function estimates
First experiments: 1) Test on small MDP with known optimal policy; 2) Compare convergence speed with different initializations; 3) Evaluate sensitivity to discount factor choices

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are primarily asymptotic with limited discussion of convergence rates
- Computational complexity not thoroughly analyzed for large state spaces
- Experimental validation limited to relatively small-scale problems
- Assumes full knowledge of MDP model, limiting practical applicability

## Confidence
High confidence in the theoretical framework and algorithm development
Medium confidence in the convergence proofs and monotonic improvement guarantees
Low confidence in the scalability and practical applicability of the proposed methods

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on larger-scale MDP problems to evaluate scalability and computational efficiency
2. Implement and test the algorithms in a model-free setting using function approximation techniques
3. Perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameter choices and initial conditions on algorithm performance
