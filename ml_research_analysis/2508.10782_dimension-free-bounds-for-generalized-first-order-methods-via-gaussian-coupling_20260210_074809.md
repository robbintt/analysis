# Dimension-Free Bounds for Generalized First-Order Methods via Gaussian Coupling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.10782
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10782
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** This paper establishes non-asymptotic bounds for generalized first-order iterative algorithms, including gradient-based optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP), when applied to Gaussian data matrices with full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The key innovation is a constructive coupling between the iterates of the generalized first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion. This coupling enables tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and moment-matching conditions. The analysis departs from classical AMP proofs by using a direct comparison between the generalized first-order method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process, providing a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of the upper bounds. The primary result shows that the coupling error concentrates at a scale independent of the ambient dimension, with explicit bounds on the error that improve upon previous work.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel constructive coupling technique that links generalized first-order methods (GFMs) operating on Gaussian data matrices to conditionally Gaussian comparison processes. The key innovation is that this coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and moment-matching conditions, extending AMP theory to non-separable nonlinearities without relying on asymptotic arguments. The paper establishes both upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the coupled processes, demonstrating the sharpness of the theoretical guarantees. This framework provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices while enabling analysis of more general iterative algorithms beyond traditional separable AMP.

## Method Summary
The method constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process. The coupling uses an independent copy of the data matrix, $A'$, to provide a stochastic correction term that forces the original iterative process to track a simpler comparison process whose covariance evolves deterministically. This construction leverages Gaussian concentration of measure to ensure the coupling error remains bounded independently of the ambient dimension. The analysis is non-asymptotic and applies to full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities, departing from classical AMP proofs that rely on separability or asymptotic arguments. The method provides both upper bounds on the coupling error and complementary lower bounds on the Wasserstein distance to demonstrate the sharpness of the theoretical guarantees.

## Key Results

- Constructs explicit coupling yielding tight, dimension-free bounds under Lipschitz and moment-matching conditions
- Provides complementary Wasserstein lower bounds demonstrating sharpness of upper bounds

- Improves upon previous work by handling full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities without separability assumptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The trajectories of generalized first-order methods (GFMs) on Gaussian matrices can be coupled to a simpler conditionally Gaussian process such that the coupling error is independent of the ambient dimension.
- **Mechanism:** The paper introduces a constructive coupling (Definition 2) that uses an independent copy of the data matrix, $A'$, to provide a stochastic correction term. This construction forces the original iterative process $x_t$ to track a conditionally Gaussian process $y_t$ whose covariance evolves deterministically via state evolution.
- **Core assumption:** The data matrix $A$ belongs to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), and the update functions are Lipschitz continuous.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates... and a conditionally Gaussian process"
  - [section 3.1]: Definition 2 details the usage of $A, A'$ and the orthonormal basis $q_t$ to enforce the coupling.
  - [corpus]: Related work ("On Universality of Non-Separable AMP") establishes the importance of analyzing non-separable functions, which this mechanism supports by avoiding separability assumptions.
- **Break condition:** If the data matrix deviates significantly from the GOE distribution (e.g., heavy-tailed or deterministic structure), the specific Gaussian correction terms derived in Definition 2 may not yield a valid coupling.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The deviation between the original system and the comparison process concentrates at a scale determined by constants (Lipschitz, time steps) rather than the matrix dimension $n$.
- **Mechanism:** The error analysis leverages the **Gaussian concentration of measure**. Since the comparison process $y_t$ is constructed as a Lipschitz function of i.i.d. Gaussian variables, its fluctuations are tightly controlled. Theorem 4 bounds the coupling error using stability analysis and matrix perturbation bounds (Lemma 12), showing that the "dimension-free" property arises because the normalized error norm vanishes effectively for large $n$.
- **Core assumption:** The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the comparison process must remain positive definite (well-conditioned) throughout the iterations.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz... conditions"
  - [section 4.4]: Proofs utilize Lipschitz properties to apply Gaussian concentration (Lemma 10) and control error accumulation via stability constants like $(1 + 4L_f + L_g)^{T-1}$.
  - [corpus]: The neighbor "Variational Tail Bounds for Norms of Random Vectors" provides general context for concentration, though this paper specifies the mechanism via the Lipschitz assumption.
- **Break condition:** If the number of time steps $T$ grows too quickly relative to $n$ (specifically violating $T = o(\log n)$), or if the covariance $\Sigma$ becomes degenerate (condition number explodes), the accumulated error may no longer remain bounded independently of $n$.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The derived upper bounds on coupling error are sharp and cannot be improved without stronger assumptions.
- **Mechanism:** The paper utilizes **Wasserstein distance** lower bounds (Theorem 6). By analyzing a simplified setting (linear functions), they explicitly calculate the quadratic Wasserstein distance between the law of the original iterates and the comparison process. This shows a fundamental "floor" to the error that matches the order of the upper bounds.
- **Core assumption:** The analysis of tightness focuses on a simplified class of linear/constant functions (Condition 1) to derive exact expressions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "complementary lower bound on the Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness"
  - [section 3.3]: Theorem 6 and Corollary 7 explicitly calculate the lower bound limits.
  - [corpus]: [Weak/Missing] No specific corpus neighbor directly addresses Wasserstein lower bounds for this specific coupling mechanism.
- **Break condition:** The tightness guarantee applies to the general class of Lipschitz functions; if the specific application uses functions with much smoother properties (higher-order differentiability), the bounds might be loose conservative estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Approximate Message Passing (AMP) & State Evolution
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames its results as a generalization and non-asymptotic proof of AMP theory. Understanding that AMP iterates can be described by a deterministic "state evolution" recursion is the baseline intuition the paper builds upon.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why the "Onsager correction" term in standard AMP is necessary to make the iterates appear Gaussian?

- **Concept:** Gaussian Concentration of Measure (Tsirelson–Ibragimov–Sudakov Inequality)
  - **Why needed here:** This is the mathematical engine driving the "dimension-free" result. It ensures that Lipschitz functions of Gaussian matrices do not fluctuate wildly, allowing the error to be bounded by constants rather than dimension $n$.
  - **Quick check question:** If a function $f$ is $L$-Lipschitz, does the variance of $f(Z)$ for Gaussian $Z$ scale with the dimension of $Z$?

- **Concept:** Wasserstein Distance ($W_2$)
  - **Why needed here:** Used to rigorously define the "distance" between the distribution of the algorithm's iterates and the idealized Gaussian process, providing a metric for the lower bound proof.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is the Wasserstein distance often preferred over Total Variation distance when comparing continuous distributions in high-dimensional optimization contexts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** System (1): The target GFM $x_t = A f_t + g_t$ (The algorithm you actually run) -> Process (2): The Comparison Process $y_t = m_t + w_t$ (The theoretical proxy) -> Definition 1 (State Evolution): The logic determining the parameters $(m, \Sigma)$ for the comparison process -> Definition 2 (Coupling): The constructive "glue" using $A'$ and orthogonalization ($q_t$) to measure the gap between System (1) and Process (2)

- **Critical path:** Implementing the Coupling Construction (Def 2) correctly is the most sensitive step. You must ensure the orthonormalization of $f_t$ (creating $q_t$) is numerically stable to generate the correct Gaussian innovations $z_t$.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Generality vs. Rate:** The paper handles general non-separable functions but constrains the time steps to $T = o(\log n)$. If you need $T \sim n$, this specific theoretical guarantee breaks.
  - **Assumption strictness:** Using pseudo-Lipschitz functions allows broader applicability but complicates the stability analysis compared to strictly linear updates.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Exploding Condition Number:** If $\Sigma$ (covariance) approaches singularity, the term $\kappa(\Sigma)$ blows up, violating the dimension-free promise.
  - **Stability Decay:** If Lipschitz constants are large, the factor $(1 + L)^T$ dominates, making the bound vacuous.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validation on Ridge Regression:** Implement the coupling for a separable ridge regression problem to verify that the empirical coupling error $\|X-Y\|$ matches the $O(1)$ (dimension-free) scaling predicted by Theorem 1 as $n$ increases.
  2. **Stress Test $T$ vs. $n$:** Run the algorithm for $T \gg \log n$ to empirically observe the transition where the dimension-free bound fails and error accumulation becomes visible.
  3. **Non-separable Test:** Apply the method to a matrix factorization problem (inherently non-separable) to test the efficacy of the generalized coupling (Def 2) against standard AMP baselines which might assume separability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the dimension-free bounds for generalized first-order methods with non-separable nonlinearities be extended to non-Gaussian matrix ensembles?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 2.3 contrasts the paper's results with Han [34], noting a trade-off where Han achieves universality (non-Gaussian matrices) but requires row-separable nonlinearities and stronger smoothness, whereas this paper allows non-separable functions but requires Gaussian data.
- Why unresolved: The constructive coupling relies explicitly on the properties of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) and Gaussian integration by parts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof demonstrating that the coupling error remains dimension-free for matrices with independent entries matching only the first and second moments, without requiring separability constraints.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the analysis be refined to ensure bounds remain tight near the fixed points of state evolution where the covariance matrix becomes near-degenerate?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.2.1 notes that closeness to a fixed point implies the covariance $\Sigma$ is near degenerate, causing the condition number $\kappa(\Sigma)$ to grow without bound, which negatively impacts the convergence rates derived in Theorem 5.
- Why unresolved: The current bounds depend on the condition number of $\Sigma$, so the theoretical guarantee degrades as the algorithm converges to a steady state.
- What evidence would resolve it: A refined bound showing the coupling error remains controlled even as the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix approaches zero.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the number of iterations $T$ scale polynomially with the dimension $n$ while maintaining valid non-asymptotic bounds in the general setting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes in Section 2.3 that specialized results for spiked models allow polynomial scaling, but this theory is restricted to $T = o(\log n)$ for general nonlinearities.
- Why unresolved: The Gaussian coupling error accumulates in a manner that currently limits $T$ to logarithmic scaling relative to $n$.
- What evidence would resolve it: A coupling mechanism or stability analysis that controls the accumulation of errors over $\text{poly}(n)$ steps for generic Lipschitz functions.

## Limitations
- The constructive coupling technique relies critically on the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble assumption for the data matrix
- Dimension-free property requires the state evolution covariance $\Sigma$ to remain well-conditioned throughout iterations
- The universal constants in main theorems are not explicitly provided and depend on implicit log-factors
- The sharpness proof is established for a simplified class of functions and may not fully extend to all Lipschitz nonlinearities

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core theoretical framework (Definition 1 and 2) is mathematically rigorous, and the Lipschitz and Gaussian concentration arguments (Theorem 4) are standard and sound
- **Medium Confidence:** The explicit Wasserstein lower bound (Theorem 6) demonstrates sharpness, but the tightness is proven for a simplified class of functions and may not fully extend to all Lipschitz nonlinearities
- **Low Confidence:** The universal constants $c, C$ in the main theorems are not explicitly provided and depend on implicit log-factors and stability constants, making practical interpretation of the bounds difficult without further numerical calibration

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical Validation of Dimension-Free Scaling:** Implement the coupling for a scalar AMP regression problem and systematically vary $n$ (e.g., from 100 to 10,000). Plot the empirical coupling error $\|X - Y\|$ and verify it remains constant as $n$ increases, as predicted by Theorem 1.

2. **Stress Test Covariance Condition Number:** For a non-separable problem (e.g., matrix factorization), monitor the condition number $\kappa(\Sigma)$ throughout the iterations. Demonstrate that the error bound (Eq 12) remains controlled only while $\kappa(\Sigma)$ is bounded, and show how the bound degrades when $\Sigma$ becomes ill-conditioned.

3. **Tightness Verification for Non-Linear Functions:** Extend the Wasserstein lower bound analysis beyond the linear/constant function case (Condition 1) to a simple non-separable nonlinearity (e.g., $\text{ReLU}$). Numerically estimate the Wasserstein distance between the coupled processes and verify it matches the order of the upper bound, confirming the practical sharpness of the theoretical guarantee.
