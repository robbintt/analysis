# Agent-Based Modular Learning for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Human-Agent Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10975
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10975
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Modular multi-agent architecture achieves 48.2%-54.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a modular multi-agent architecture for multimodal emotion recognition that processes video input through independent modality agents (facial, speech, text, and audio event detection) coordinated by a central supervisor classifier. The design enables easy integration of new modalities, simple replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead compared to traditional monolithic approaches. The system demonstrates effectiveness on the CMU-MOSEI dataset, though reported accuracy scores remain relatively modest compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs a central supervisor classifier that coordinates four independent modality agents: facial expression recognition, speech emotion recognition, text emotion recognition, and audio event detection. Each agent processes its respective modality in parallel and generates emotion predictions independently. The supervisor then aggregates these predictions to produce the final emotion classification. This modular design allows for independent updates and replacements of individual components without requiring retraining of the entire system. The architecture is evaluated using various classifier architectures including MLP, CatBoost, and logistic regression on the CMU-MOSEI dataset.

## Key Results
- Accuracy scores ranging from 48.2% to 54.1% depending on classifier architecture used
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values between 0.36 and 0.61
- Demonstrated flexibility in adding/modifying individual modality agents
- Reduced computational overhead compared to monolithic approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The modular design works by decoupling modality-specific processing from the overall emotion recognition task, allowing each agent to specialize in its respective domain. This separation enables independent optimization and updating of individual components, reducing the complexity of maintaining the entire system. The supervisor classifier can focus on learning optimal fusion strategies rather than processing raw multimodal data directly. The architecture also allows for graceful degradation when individual modalities fail or are unavailable, as remaining agents can continue to provide predictions.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Emotion Recognition**: Understanding how to process and combine multiple input modalities (visual, audio, text) to infer emotional states. Needed because human emotion expression is inherently multimodal, and single-modality approaches miss important contextual cues. Quick check: Verify understanding of basic emotion categories and their multimodal manifestations.

**Modular Architecture Design**: Principles of decomposing complex systems into independent, interchangeable components. Needed to enable scalability, maintainability, and independent development of system parts. Quick check: Can identify clear interfaces and data flows between modules.

**Agent-Based Systems**: Coordination mechanisms for autonomous agents working toward a common goal. Needed to manage parallel processing of different modalities while ensuring coherent final output. Quick check: Understand basic multi-agent communication and decision aggregation patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Video -> [Facial Agent, Speech Agent, Text Agent, Audio Event Agent] -> Supervisor Classifier -> Final Emotion Prediction

**Critical Path**: Video preprocessing → Modality-specific feature extraction → Individual agent predictions → Supervisor aggregation → Final output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Modularity enables easier maintenance and updates but may sacrifice some performance by limiting cross-modal feature interactions that monolithic approaches can capture through end-to-end training.

**Failure Signatures**: Individual agent failures manifest as degraded performance in their specific modality domain but don't necessarily cause complete system failure due to redundancy and the supervisor's ability to rely on remaining modalities.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run system with all four modalities enabled to establish baseline performance
2. Disable individual agents sequentially to test robustness and identify critical modalities
3. Compare performance against a monolithic baseline using identical underlying models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reported accuracy scores (48.2%-54.1%) remain relatively modest compared to state-of-the-art monolithic approaches
- System's reliance on multiple classifiers may limit capture of cross-modal temporal dependencies
- Evaluation conducted solely on CMU-MOSEI dataset, raising generalizability concerns

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The modular architecture design principles and computational efficiency advantages are well-supported by the experimental setup and methodology.

**Medium Confidence**: The claimed superiority in flexibility and maintainability is reasonable given the architecture, but lacks comparative analysis against other modular approaches.

**Medium Confidence**: The performance metrics are reproducible based on the described methodology, though the absolute values suggest room for improvement in the underlying emotion recognition models.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-dataset validation using diverse emotion recognition datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, MELD) to assess generalization capabilities across different modalities and cultural contexts.

2. Perform ablation studies comparing the proposed modular approach against monolithic architectures with identical underlying models to quantify the performance trade-offs of modularity.

3. Implement and evaluate the system's response to modality failures by systematically disabling individual agents to verify the robustness claims and identify potential cascading failure modes.
