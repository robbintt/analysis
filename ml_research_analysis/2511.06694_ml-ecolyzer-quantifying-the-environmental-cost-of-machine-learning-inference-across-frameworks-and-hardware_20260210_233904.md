# ML-EcoLyzer: Quantifying the Environmental Cost of Machine Learning Inference Across Frameworks and Hardware

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.06694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06694
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Introduces ML-EcoLyzer tool with Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS) to fairly compare ML inference efficiency across frameworks, models, and hardware

## Executive Summary
ML-EcoLyzer is an open-source framework for measuring the environmental impact of machine learning inference, quantifying carbon emissions, energy, thermal, and water usage across CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators. The tool introduces the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which normalizes carbon emissions per effective parameter, enabling fair comparison across model sizes, quantization levels, and hardware configurations. Empirical evaluation across over 1,900 configurations demonstrates that quantization significantly improves ESS, large accelerators are only efficient under full utilization, and even small classical models can be inefficient when run suboptimally on idle CPUs.

## Method Summary
ML-EcoLyzer measures inference-time environmental costs by integrating power consumption data (sampled at adaptive rates of 1-5 Hz) with regional carbon intensity and infrastructure efficiency factors. The framework calculates carbon emissions using the formula CO₂ = E × CI × PUE, where energy E is integrated from power traces, CI is regional carbon intensity, and PUE varies by hardware tier (1.1 for CPU, 1.2 for consumer GPU, 1.4 for datacenter GPU). The Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS) normalizes these emissions by effective parameters (N × QF / 10⁶), where QF is a quantization factor (1.0 for FP32, 0.5 for FP16, 0.25 for INT8). The tool also estimates water usage based on regional water intensity and infrastructure overhead.

## Key Results
- Quantization significantly improves ESS, with INT8 achieving 25-55% power savings and 2-4× better efficiency than FP32
- Large accelerators only achieve high ESS under full utilization; idle overhead dominates for light workloads
- Modern transformer models often achieve higher ESS than traditional ML models when properly configured
- Even small classical models can be inefficient when run on idle CPUs due to system overhead
- Adaptive monitoring at 5 Hz reduces measurement error by ~6% compared to 1 Hz for short inference tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS) enables fair comparison across models of varying size, precision, and hardware by normalizing carbon emissions per effective parameter.
- Mechanism: ESS computes effective parameters (N × QF / 10⁶) divided by CO₂ emitted (grams), where QF is a quantization factor (1.0 for FP32, 0.5 for FP16, 0.25 for INT8). This accounts for both model capacity and precision-based efficiency gains.
- Core assumption: Lower-precision inference reduces memory, compute, and energy proportionally on hardware with native quantized operation support.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introduces the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which measures effective parameters per gram of CO₂ emitted, enabling fair comparison across model sizes, quantization, and hardware"
  - [section: ML Ecolyzer] Equations 5-6 define Effective Parameters and ESS; QF values justified by mixed-precision profiling literature (Micikevicius et al. 2017; Jacob et al. 2018)
  - [corpus] Related work on energy scaling laws (arXiv:2601.08991) notes inference cost is under-studied but supports precision-based optimization
- Break condition: ESS may mislead if used alone on very large models with high per-parameter efficiency but unsustainable total emissions; must interpret alongside absolute CO₂.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-framework energy-to-emissions conversion via tiered PUE and regional carbon intensity yields reproducible inference-time carbon estimates.
- Mechanism: CO₂ (kg) = E (kWh) × CI (kg CO₂/kWh) × PUE, with tier-specific PUE: 1.1 (CPU-only), 1.2 (consumer GPU), 1.4 (datacenter GPU). Energy E is computed by integrating instantaneous power over time.
- Core assumption: PUE values from industry benchmarks (Koomey 2008; Masanet et al. 2020; Bizo et al. 2022) are representative of target deployment environments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "measuring carbon emissions, energy, thermal, and water usage" across hardware tiers
  - [section: ML Ecolyzer] Equation 2 and tier-specific PUE values; Equation 3 for energy integration
  - [corpus] "How Hungry is AI?" (arXiv:2505.09598) uses similar infrastructure-aware multipliers for commercial datacenter inference
- Break condition: Regional CI and PUE values must be updated for local context; default values may under- or over-estimate for atypical facilities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adaptive monitoring at higher sampling rates (5 Hz vs 1 Hz) reduces measurement error for short inference tasks.
- Mechanism: Power is sampled at adaptive rates (1–5 Hz); Table 5 shows 1 Hz overestimates CO₂ by +5.8% vs 5 Hz baseline, with error diminishing at higher rates.
- Core assumption: Short or bursty inference tasks are sensitive to sampling granularity; sustained workloads are less affected.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation"
  - [section: Experiments, Monitoring Sensitivity] Table 5 documents error by sampling rate
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on sampling-rate effects; related work on embedded inference (arXiv:2510.24951) emphasizes measurement constraints but not sampling frequency
- Break condition: Very short inferences (<100 ms) may still be undersampled even at 5 Hz; overhead of monitoring itself must be subtracted.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Carbon intensity (CI) and PUE
  - Why needed here: These factors convert raw energy into emissions and account for datacenter overhead; misunderstanding leads to incorrect comparisons.
  - Quick check question: If a model consumes 0.01 kWh on a desktop GPU (PUE 1.2) in a region with CI = 0.5 kg CO₂/kWh, what is the estimated emission?

- Concept: Quantization factor (QF) and precision impact
  - Why needed here: ESS depends on QF to normalize across FP32/FP16/INT8; wrong QF skews efficiency rankings.
  - Quick check question: A 7B parameter model in INT8 has how many effective parameters (in millions)?

- Concept: Per-inference vs rate-based metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes per-sample cost from per-minute throughput; conflation leads to misinterpretation of efficiency.
  - Quick check question: When is per-inference CO₂ more useful than CO₂ per minute for sustainability decisions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Power monitors (NVIDIA-SMI, psutil) -> Energy integrator (Eq. 3) -> Emissions calculator (Eq. 2, with CI + PUE) -> Water estimator (Eq. 4, using regional WI and cooling overhead) -> ESS calculator (Eq. 6, using effective parameters from Eq. 5) -> Thermal monitor (flags GPU >80°C, CPU >85°C)

- Critical path: 1. Configure hardware tier, region, and precision 2. Run inference with adaptive sampling (start at 5 Hz for short tasks) 3. Collect power trace, integrate to energy, apply CI/PUE 4. Compute water, thermal overhead, and ESS 5. Compare ESS across configurations for selection

- Design tradeoffs: Higher sampling -> more accurate but higher overhead; Large accelerators -> high ESS only under full utilization; idle overhead dominates for light workloads; Quantization -> better ESS and lower absolute CO₂ but may reduce accuracy (INT8: 94.2% retention per Table 4)

- Failure signatures: ESS near zero for small CPU models (Table 2: CPU sklearn ESS = 0.09) indicates system overhead dominates; batching required; High variance in ESS (e.g., Qwen 2: σ >> μ) suggests hardware utilization or configuration inconsistency; Thermal flags (>80°C GPU) indicate cooling overhead not captured in baseline PUE

- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline calibration: Run a standard model (e.g., LLaMA 2 7B) on CPU, consumer GPU, and datacenter GPU at FP32; compare absolute CO₂ and ESS to validate tiered PUE 2. Quantization sweep: Test same model at FP32, FP16, INT8; verify power savings (25–55%) and ESS improvement match Table 4 ranges 3. Sampling sensitivity: Repeat a short inference (<200 ms) at 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 5 Hz; confirm error reduction pattern from Table 5

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do environmental costs scale for batched and streaming inference workloads compared to the single-inference baseline ML-EcoLyzer currently measures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Potential directions for future work include expanding ML-EcoLyzer to support batched and streaming inference scenarios"
- Why unresolved: All 1,900+ measurements use per-inference normalization; real-world deployments rarely process single samples sequentially, so scaling behavior under batching remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical measurements of energy, carbon, and ESS across varying batch sizes (1, 8, 32, 128, etc.) for representative model architectures and hardware configurations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the linear quantization factor (QF) scaling assumption hold across all hardware architectures and model types, or do nonlinear energy-precision relationships emerge?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes QF scales linearly (1.0 for FP32, 0.5 for FP16, 0.25 for INT8), noting only that this "reflects the observation" of near-proportional reductions. Hardware without native quantization support may violate this assumption.
- Why unresolved: The empirical validation covers only transformer-based tasks on GPU/accelerator hardware; classical models or edge CPUs may exhibit different scaling behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-hardware comparison of measured vs. predicted energy savings at each precision level, with deviation quantification for architectures lacking native low-precision acceleration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would dynamic, real-time regional grid carbon intensity data change the accuracy of emissions estimates compared to the static CI values currently used?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion lists "incorporating real-time regional grid carbon intensity data for dynamic emissions estimation" as future work.
- Why unresolved: Current methodology uses fixed regional coefficients; grid carbon intensity varies hourly and seasonally, potentially introducing systematic estimation errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: A/B comparison of emissions estimates using static vs. real-time CI data across multiple geographic regions and time periods.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do the environmental cost relationships identified for inference transfer to training workloads and multi-model serving deployments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We also see value in...extending the analysis to encompass training workloads and multi-model serving deployments"
- Why unresolved: The paper deliberately focuses on inference; whether quantization benefits, hardware-utilization matching, and ESS patterns generalize to training or concurrent model serving is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of ML-EcoLyzer methodology to training pipelines and multi-tenant serving infrastructure with comparative analysis of efficiency patterns.

## Limitations
- Environmental estimates depend on literature-based PUE and carbon intensity values rather than measured infrastructure metrics
- ESS metric may oversimplify efficiency comparisons when used in isolation for very large models
- Water usage estimation relies on regional multipliers that may not capture local facility-specific cooling methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Cross-framework compatibility claims (validated by measuring 1,900+ configurations across PyTorch, Hugging Face, scikit-learn), adaptive monitoring methodology (supported by direct error quantification in Table 5), and quantization efficiency gains (empirically measured across precision levels)
- **Medium confidence**: Environmental sustainability score utility (mechanism well-specified but dependent on accurate PUE/CI inputs), hardware-specific efficiency claims (based on benchmark data rather than exhaustive real-world validation), and water usage estimation (methodologically sound but dependent on regional multipliers)
- **Low confidence**: Claims about transformer models achieving higher ESS than classical ML (limited to specific configurations; broader generalization requires additional validation), and the assertion that small classical models can be inefficient on idle CPUs (mechanism sound but dependent on specific utilization patterns)

## Next Checks
1. **Infrastructure Validation**: Replicate the environmental measurements on a different hardware setup with known PUE and regional carbon intensity to verify the tiered multiplier approach. Compare results when using actual measured PUE values versus literature-based estimates.

2. **ESS Utility Test**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing model selection decisions made using ESS alone versus ESS combined with absolute CO₂ metrics. Evaluate whether ESS leads to different hardware/software choices than traditional energy or carbon-only metrics.

3. **Sampling Rate Impact**: Systematically vary sampling rates (1 Hz, 2 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz) on short inference tasks (<500ms) to verify the error reduction pattern documented in Table 5. Measure the overhead introduced by higher sampling rates to determine the optimal tradeoff point.
