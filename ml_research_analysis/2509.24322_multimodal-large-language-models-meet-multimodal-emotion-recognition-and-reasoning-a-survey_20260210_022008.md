# Multimodal Large Language Models Meet Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.24322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24322
- Authors: Yuntao Shou; Tao Meng; Wei Ai; Keqin Li
- Reference count: 40
- This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets, benchmarks, and experimental results.

## Executive Summary
This survey presents the first comprehensive examination of multimodal large language models applied to emotion recognition and reasoning. The authors introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes methods into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning paradigms, analyzing zero-shot/few-shot learning and full-parameter/parameter-efficient tuning strategies. Through systematic analysis of experimental results, the survey identifies key challenges including fine-grained multimodal alignment, temporal reasoning, and efficient scaling. The work highlights promising directions such as affect-oriented instruction tuning and audio-visual fusion while emphasizing the need for hierarchical cross-modal alignment and deployment-friendly architectures for real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic review methodology, examining existing MLLM approaches through a newly proposed taxonomy framework. The authors categorize methods into two primary paradigms: parameter-frozen approaches that leverage pre-trained models with minimal adaptation, and parameter-tuning strategies that include zero-shot/few-shot learning as well as full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques. The analysis encompasses model architectures, benchmark datasets, experimental results, and performance evaluations across multiple tasks. The survey synthesizes findings from 40+ references to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning.

## Key Results
- The survey introduces a novel taxonomy categorizing MLLM approaches into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning paradigms
- Affect-oriented instruction tuning and audio-visual fusion significantly improve performance on benchmarks like DFEW and MME-Emotion
- Key challenges identified include fine-grained multimodal alignment, temporal reasoning, and efficient scaling for real-world deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of MLLMs in emotion recognition stems from their ability to integrate multiple modalities (text, audio, visual) through cross-modal attention mechanisms and hierarchical feature fusion. The survey demonstrates that affect-oriented instruction tuning enables models to better understand nuanced emotional expressions by incorporating domain-specific knowledge during training. Audio-visual fusion strategies enhance performance by capturing complementary emotional cues across modalities, with temporal modeling allowing for reasoning about emotional trajectories. The parameter-tuning approaches, particularly parameter-efficient methods, allow for effective adaptation to emotion recognition tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-modal attention mechanisms**: Why needed - to align and fuse information across different modalities; Quick check - verify attention weights show meaningful cross-modal interactions
- **Temporal modeling**: Why needed - emotions evolve over time in video sequences; Quick check - test model performance on temporally complex emotional scenarios
- **Parameter-efficient tuning**: Why needed - to adapt large models to specific tasks without full fine-tuning; Quick check - compare performance vs. parameter count and compute requirements
- **Affect-oriented instruction tuning**: Why needed - to incorporate domain-specific emotional knowledge; Quick check - evaluate zero-shot performance on unseen emotional expressions
- **Multimodal fusion strategies**: Why needed - to combine complementary information from different modalities; Quick check - ablate individual modalities to measure contribution

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Multimodal input encoders -> Cross-modal fusion module -> Temporal reasoning layer -> Emotion classification head
- **Critical path**: Visual/audio encoders -> Cross-modal attention -> Temporal modeling -> Classification
- **Design tradeoffs**: Parameter-frozen (faster, less flexible) vs. parameter-tuning (slower, more adaptable); Full fine-tuning (better performance, higher cost) vs. parameter-efficient tuning (good performance, lower cost)
- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse in cross-modal attention, temporal reasoning errors on long sequences, over-reliance on dominant modalities
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Ablation study of individual modalities on DFEW benchmark, 2) Comparison of different fusion strategies (early vs. late vs. hybrid), 3) Zero-shot vs. few-shot performance on MME-Emotion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several key open questions: How to achieve fine-grained multimodal alignment across diverse emotional contexts? What are the optimal strategies for temporal reasoning in long-form emotional content? How can we scale MLLMs efficiently for real-time deployment? The authors also highlight the need for better cross-cultural validation and more robust benchmarks that capture the complexity of real-world emotional expressions.

## Limitations
- Generalizability concerns across diverse emotional contexts and cultural settings
- Taxonomy may not fully capture emerging hybrid approaches combining parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning strategies
- Performance improvements may be benchmark-specific with limited validation on real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- Taxonomy and categorization framework: **High**
- Performance claims on DFEW and MME-Emotion benchmarks: **Medium**
- Real-world deployment readiness and challenges: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Cross-cultural validation: Test the surveyed MLLM approaches on emotion recognition datasets from multiple cultural contexts to assess robustness beyond Western-centric benchmarks
2. Temporal reasoning evaluation: Design controlled experiments specifically targeting the temporal reasoning capabilities mentioned as a key challenge, using video sequences with clear emotional trajectories
3. Deployment efficiency benchmarking: Measure inference latency, memory footprint, and computational requirements across different MLLM architectures in resource-constrained environments to validate the survey's claims about deployment-friendly architectures
