# Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.10350
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Key outcome:** Introduces geometric framework for analyzing agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems in semantic embedding space, demonstrating that prompt design directly controls dynamical regimes.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a geometric framework for analyzing agentic loops—recursive LLM systems where outputs become inputs—as discrete dynamical systems in semantic embedding space. The authors define trajectories, clusters, attractors, and dynamical regimes (contractive, oscillatory, exploratory) using calibrated semantic similarity that aligns with human judgments while preserving local stability. Through controlled experiments on singular loops, they demonstrate that prompt design directly controls dynamical regime: a paraphrase prompt produces contractive dynamics with convergence to stable attractors and decreasing dispersion (local similarity >0.85), while a summarize-and-negate prompt yields exploratory dynamics with unbounded divergence and no cluster formation (local similarity <0.5). The framework enables stability analysis, trajectory prediction, and principled design of composite loops that balance convergence and exploration.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems operating in semantic embedding space, where each iteration maps an input embedding to an output embedding through the LLM. They introduce calibrated semantic similarity metrics that align with human judgments while preserving local stability, enabling quantitative analysis of trajectory behavior. The framework defines key concepts including trajectories (sequences of embeddings), clusters (groups of similar embeddings), attractors (stable convergence points), and dynamical regimes characterized by their stability properties. Experiments use controlled singular loops with carefully designed prompts to demonstrate how different prompt structures induce distinct dynamical behaviors.

## Key Results
- Paraphrase prompts produce contractive dynamics with convergence to stable attractors and decreasing dispersion (local similarity >0.85)
- Summarize-and-negate prompts yield exploratory dynamics with unbounded divergence and no cluster formation (local similarity <0.5)
- The geometric framework successfully predicts trajectory stability and enables principled design of composite loops balancing convergence and exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating the agentic loop as a discrete dynamical system where the LLM's output function becomes a state transition operator in semantic embedding space. The calibrated semantic similarity metric ensures that geometric properties in the embedding space correspond to meaningful semantic relationships, allowing traditional dynamical systems analysis tools to be applied. By preserving local stability while aligning with human judgments, the metric captures both the mathematical structure needed for analysis and the semantic meaning needed for practical interpretation. This dual alignment enables the identification of attractors and the characterization of dynamical regimes based on trajectory behavior.

## Foundational Learning

**Semantic Embedding Space**: High-dimensional vector representations where semantically similar texts are geometrically close. Why needed: Provides the geometric foundation for analyzing trajectory behavior. Quick check: Similar texts should have cosine similarity >0.7.

**Discrete Dynamical Systems**: Mathematical framework for systems that evolve in discrete time steps. Why needed: Models the iterative nature of agentic loops. Quick check: Can be represented as x_{n+1} = f(x_n).

**Semantic Similarity Calibration**: Process of aligning geometric similarity metrics with human semantic judgments. Why needed: Ensures that mathematical distances correspond to meaningful semantic differences. Quick check: Human-rated similar pairs should score >0.8 similarity.

**Attractors and Basins**: Stable states and their surrounding regions in dynamical systems. Why needed: Characterizes long-term behavior and convergence properties. Quick check: Nearby points should converge to the same attractor.

**Dynamical Regimes**: Classification of system behavior based on stability properties. Why needed: Provides framework for understanding different types of loop behavior. Quick check: Should predict whether trajectories converge, oscillate, or diverge.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> LLM Model -> Output Text -> Embedding Function -> Semantic Space -> Similarity Computation -> Dynamical Analysis -> Regime Classification

**Critical Path**: Input → LLM → Output → Embedding → Similarity → Trajectory Analysis → Regime Determination

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances mathematical rigor (requiring stable geometric properties) against practical utility (requiring alignment with human semantic judgments). Tighter calibration improves semantic relevance but may reduce mathematical tractability. Simpler prompt structures enable clearer analysis but may not capture real-world complexity.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Representation drift causing geometric properties to degrade over iterations
- Context window limitations truncating trajectories prematurely  
- Calibration misalignment leading to false stability predictions
- Non-smooth embedding transitions breaking continuity assumptions

**First Experiments**:
1. Test single-agent loop with paraphrase prompt to verify contractive dynamics and attractor formation
2. Test single-agent loop with summarize-and-negate prompt to verify exploratory dynamics and divergence
3. Compare calibrated similarity metrics against human judgments across multiple domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The geometric framework assumes stable semantic embedding properties that may degrade due to representation drift over extended iterations
- Calibration process, while validated, may require domain-specific tuning for broader applicability
- Controlled experiments focus on simple singular loops, leaving scalability to multi-agent systems and complex composite loops untested

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Mathematical formalization of agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems is sound
- Experimental demonstrations of distinct dynamical regimes are reproducible

**Medium Confidence:**
- Semantic similarity calibration produces reasonable alignment with human judgments
- Cluster identification methodology works for controlled experiments

**Low Confidence:**
- Long-term stability predictions for complex composite loops remain speculative
- Impact of representation drift on trajectory stability not thoroughly characterized

## Next Checks
1. Test framework across multiple model architectures to assess generalizability of calibrated similarity metrics and dynamical regime predictions
2. Conduct stress tests with extended iteration counts to characterize onset and impact of representation drift on trajectory stability
3. Validate framework on multi-agent loop configurations with branching logic to assess scalability and identify failure modes
