# Activity and Subject Detection for UCI HAR Dataset with & without missing Sensor Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06730
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06730
- Authors: Debashish Saha; Piyush Malik; Adrika Saha
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Lightweight LSTM model achieves 93.89% activity recognition and 80.19% subject identification accuracy on UCI HAR dataset

## Executive Summary
This study presents a dual-task framework for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) that simultaneously performs activity and subject classification while handling missing sensor data. The proposed LSTM-based model demonstrates strong performance on the UCI HAR dataset, achieving 93.89% accuracy for activity recognition and 80.19% for subject identification. The framework's robustness under simulated sensor failures is validated through various imputation techniques, with KNN imputation showing particular effectiveness. The work addresses both the classification challenge and the practical concern of sensor data degradation in real-world deployment scenarios.

## Method Summary
The study employs a lightweight LSTM architecture to tackle the dual challenge of activity and subject identification from accelerometer and gyroscope data. The framework incorporates data preprocessing with normalization and zero-mean scaling, followed by multiple imputation strategies to handle missing sensor values. Simulated sensor failures are introduced by randomly removing data from 10% to 90% of time steps. The model is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and performance is compared across different imputation methods including KNN, mean, and forward fill approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93.89% accuracy for activity recognition on UCI HAR dataset
- Achieved 80.19% accuracy for subject identification on UCI HAR dataset
- KNN imputation proved most effective for handling missing sensor data, particularly when used without additional preprocessing steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LSTM architecture effectively captures temporal dependencies in sensor data, which is crucial for both activity recognition and subject identification tasks. The bidirectional processing allows the model to leverage both past and future context when making predictions. The framework's robustness to missing data stems from the combination of imputation strategies that preserve data structure and the LSTM's ability to learn from incomplete sequences. The dual-task learning approach benefits from shared representations between activity and subject classification, improving overall performance through regularization.

## Foundational Learning
1. **LSTM Networks**: Why needed - Capture temporal dependencies in sequential sensor data; Quick check - Verify that LSTM cells properly maintain hidden states across time steps
2. **Data Imputation**: Why needed - Handle real-world sensor failures and missing data; Quick check - Compare imputation accuracy against baseline with no missing data
3. **Cross-Validation**: Why needed - Ensure model generalization across different subjects; Quick check - Validate that performance remains consistent across all folds
4. **Sensor Fusion**: Why needed - Combine accelerometer and gyroscope data for comprehensive activity recognition; Quick check - Test individual sensor performance versus combined approach
5. **Leave-One-Subject-Out**: Why needed - Maximize training data while ensuring unbiased evaluation; Quick check - Confirm that model performance doesn't degrade significantly on held-out subjects

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Sensor Data -> Preprocessing & Normalization -> Missing Data Imputation -> LSTM Layers -> Activity/Subject Classification

**Critical Path**: Sensor Data Acquisition → Preprocessing → Imputation → LSTM Processing → Classification Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Lightweight LSTM prioritizes computational efficiency over maximum accuracy, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices. The dual-task architecture shares representations between activity and subject classification, improving efficiency but potentially limiting specialization for either task.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Sensor failure patterns may not match real-world degradation scenarios
- Imputation effectiveness may vary with different missing data distributions
- Subject identification accuracy drops significantly with higher missing data percentages
- Activity recognition shows more robustness to missing data than subject identification

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance with no missing data to establish baseline accuracy
2. Test single imputation method (e.g., KNN) with varying missing data percentages (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%)
3. Compare activity recognition versus subject identification performance under identical missing data conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Subject identification accuracy (80.19%) may be insufficient for applications requiring high precision
- Simulated sensor failures may not accurately represent real-world sensor degradation patterns
- Limited evaluation of alternative deep learning architectures beyond LSTM
- Lack of comprehensive comparison with advanced imputation methods

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Activity recognition accuracy of 93.89% | High |
| Subject identification accuracy of 80.19% | Medium |
| KNN imputation effectiveness | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Deploy the model in a real-world environment with actual sensor degradation over extended periods to validate simulation-based findings
2. Compare the proposed LSTM architecture against state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer models on the same task to establish relative performance
3. Test the imputation framework with diverse missing data patterns and alternative imputation methods (e.g., MICE, deep generative models) to determine optimal strategies for different failure modes
