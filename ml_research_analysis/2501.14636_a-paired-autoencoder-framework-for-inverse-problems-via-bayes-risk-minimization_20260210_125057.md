# A Paired Autoencoder Framework for Inverse Problems via Bayes Risk Minimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.14636
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14636
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Paired autoencoder framework outperforms end-to-end approaches when training data are abundant but paired data are scarce for inverse problems

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a paired autoencoder framework for solving inverse problems by leveraging unsupervised learning to improve surrogate modeling and regularization. The method trains separate autoencoders on input and target data, then learns optimal mappings between their latent spaces, enabling efficient forward and inverse surrogate mappings. Theoretical analysis using Bayes risk minimization connects the approach to low-rank matrix approximations, providing closed-form solutions for linear cases. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to end-to-end approaches when training data are abundant but paired data are scarce, with applications in computed tomography and image deblurring.

## Method Summary
The PAIR framework decouples model and dimensionality reduction processes by training independent autoencoders on unpaired data samples, then learning a linear mapping between their latent spaces using a smaller set of paired data. The approach consists of unsupervised training of two autoencoders (one for input space B, one for target space X) followed by supervised learning of a linear map between the fixed latent representations. This enables the framework to leverage abundant unpaired data while requiring minimal paired data for the final mapping. The method provides closed-form solutions for linear cases through Bayes risk minimization and offers cheaply computable evaluation metrics for out-of-distribution detection.

## Key Results
- Average relative reconstruction error of 0.3783 for MNIST deblurring, outperforming end-to-end approaches
- Improved performance compared to truncated SVD methods in CT reconstruction
- Decoupling model and dimensionality reduction processes allows independent training with different latent space dimensions
- Framework provides cheaply computable evaluation metrics for out-of-distribution detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Decoupled Representation and Mapping Learning
The framework trains two independent autoencoders on unpaired data samples, learning compressed latent representations through self-supervised learning. A simple linear mapping is then learned between these fixed latent spaces using a much smaller set of paired data. This bypasses the need for massive end-to-end labeled datasets. The approach assumes underlying manifolds of input and target spaces can be captured independently, with the relationship between learned latent representations being learnable (often linear) with minimal paired data.

### Mechanism 2: Implicit Regularization via Bayes Risk Minimization
Framing the problem as Bayes risk minimization provides theoretical grounding for the autoencoders and maps, acting as an inherent regularizer without explicit parameter tuning. The framework minimizes expected loss subject to rank constraints, connecting directly to low-rank matrix approximation for linear cases. The theoretical solution involves projecting onto the subspace defined by truncated SVD of data covariance, naturally suppressing noise and stabilizing inversion similar to classical regularization techniques like TSVD.

### Mechanism 3: Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection
The paired autoencoder structure yields cheaply computable metrics that indicate solution reliability and detect out-of-distribution samples. The framework can compute internal consistency metrics by comparing reconstruction error in latent space between predicted and actual outputs. High values suggest inputs lie outside training distribution or reconstructions are unreliable. In-distribution samples have low reconstruction and mapping residuals in both data and latent spaces.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept: Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction**
Why needed: The core framework relies on compressing input and target data into lower-dimensional latent spaces. Understanding how autoencoders learn compressed representations helps interpret the decoupling mechanism.
Quick check: Can you explain why a bottleneck layer in a neural network forces the model to learn a compressed representation of the input?

**Concept: Bayes Risk Minimization**
Why needed: The paper derives theoretical guarantees and optimal linear mappings using this framework, connecting neural network approaches to classical statistical estimation and regularization.
Quick check: How does minimizing expected squared error relate to finding the mean of the posterior distribution in a Bayesian setting?

**Concept: Truncated SVD (TSVD) as Regularization**
Why needed: The paper shows its linear autoencoder theoretically reduces to TSVD, crucial for understanding why the method has inherent regularizing properties and avoids noise amplification.
Quick check: Why does discarding small singular values in SVD of a matrix stabilize the solution of a linear system Ax=b?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Raw input/target data -> Independent autoencoders (encoder-decoder pairs) -> Compressed latent spaces -> Linear mapping between latent spaces -> Full forward/inverse surrogate models

**Critical path:**
1. Data Prep: Gather large sets of unpaired inputs {b} and targets {x}, plus smaller set of pairs {(b,x)}
2. Unsupervised Training: Train Φ_ae^b and Φ_ae^x separately using reconstruction loss on unpaired data
3. Supervised Mapping: Fix encoder/decoder weights, project paired data into latent spaces
4. Linear Fit: Solve least-squares problem to find linear maps M and M^† between latent pairs
5. Inference: For new b, apply inverse PAIR surrogate: x_pred = d_x(M^† e_b(b))

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Latent Dimension (r): Too low causes blurry reconstructions (underfitting); too high reduces regularizing effect and may overfit noise
- Autoencoder Complexity: Simple linear encoders are interpretable and fast but may miss non-linear features; complex CNNs capture more detail but are harder to train and analyze
- Linearity of Latent Map: Linear map is fast and stable; non-linear map (e.g., MLP) might be needed if autoencoders don't fully linearize relationship, at cost of more paired data

**Failure signatures:**
- Blurry or identical outputs: Indicates latent dimension too low, forcing model to capture only "mean" features
- High OOD metrics on known data: Suggests autoencoders not generalizing well or paired data insufficient for latent mapping
- Instability with noise: Suggests rank of latent mapping or autoencoders too high, failing to provide sufficient regularization

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Linear Sanity Check: Implement fully linear PAIR (SVD-based) on simple linear inverse problem to verify TSVD performance match
2. Ablation on Paired Data: Train PAIR and end-to-end models while systematically reducing number of paired training samples; plot reconstruction error vs. number of pairs
3. OOD Detection Test: Train on one dataset (e.g., MNIST digits) and test latent-space consistency metrics on clearly different dataset (e.g., notMNIST letters)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Can the PAIR framework be adapted to approximate adjoints for computationally intensive problems within inexact Krylov methods? The paper states future work includes using PAIR to approximate adjoints for problems where the adjoint is too computationally intensive or impossible to compute. This remains unresolved as current work validates only forward and inverse surrogate mappings.

**Open Question 2:** How can the PAIR framework be utilized to define data-driven priors for uncertainty quantification? The paper proposes using the framework to define new data-driven priors and investigate uncertainty in solutions. This is unresolved as the paper focuses on Bayes risk minimization for point estimation rather than characterizing posterior distributions.

**Open Question 3:** How does theoretical and empirical performance of PAIR change when using alternative loss metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or Wasserstein distance? Section 3.1.1 notes the 2-norm is a design choice and suggests considering these alternatives. This remains unresolved as all theoretical derivations and numerical experiments are restricted to the 2-norm.

**Open Question 4:** Is there a quantifiable suboptimality gap between component-wise optimal PAIR operators and a globally optimized end-to-end network? The paper establishes optimality for individual autoencoders and mappings but does not analyze loss incurred by decoupling their training. This requires theoretical bounds on error propagation or empirical comparison against jointly trained models.

## Limitations

- Strong assumption of linear or approximately linear relationships between latent spaces may not hold for complex inverse problems
- Effectiveness relies on availability of sufficient unpaired data for robust autoencoder training
- Assumes statistical independence between signal and noise
- Performance in extreme low-data regimes (where even unpaired data is scarce) remains unexplored

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Theoretical connection to low-rank matrix approximation and TSVD is well-established; framework's effectiveness in linear case is mathematically proven
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical performance claims for non-linear cases (MNIST deblurring, CT reconstruction) are supported by numerical experiments but depend on specific implementation details
- **Low Confidence:** OOD detection capability is demonstrated only on MNIST vs. notMNIST, with limited exploration of false positive/negative rates across diverse datasets

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Paired Data Scarcity:** Systematically vary the number of paired training samples while keeping unpaired data constant to quantify the exact advantage of the PAIR framework over end-to-end approaches.

2. **Non-Linear Latent Mapping Comparison:** Replace the linear mapping between latent spaces with a small MLP and compare reconstruction performance, particularly for cases where the autoencoders may not fully linearize the relationship.

3. **Cross-Domain OOD Detection:** Test the framework's OOD detection capability on multiple out-of-distribution datasets (e.g., Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) to evaluate robustness and identify failure modes.
