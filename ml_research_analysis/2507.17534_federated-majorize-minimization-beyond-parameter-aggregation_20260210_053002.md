- Introduces FedMM framework for federated majorize-minimization optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified framework for federated majorize-minimization (MM) optimization that addresses key challenges in federated learning including data heterogeneity, partial participation, and communication constraints. The FedMM method innovates by learning and aggregating surrogate function parameters rather than model parameters, which proves more effective in federated settings. The framework incorporates control variates to handle heterogeneity and employs compression for communication efficiency. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees that are robust to data heterogeneity without requiring additional assumptions. The method is validated on federated dictionary learning and optimal transport map computation, demonstrating superior performance compared to naive aggregation approaches.

## Method Summary
The FedMM framework introduces a novel approach to federated optimization by learning and aggregating surrogate function parameters instead of model parameters. The method employs a majorize-minimization strategy where each client computes surrogate functions locally and shares their parameters with a central server. The server aggregates these parameters using a carefully designed scheme that accounts for data heterogeneity through control variates. Communication efficiency is achieved through compression techniques. The framework is designed to handle partial participation and is theoretically grounded with convergence guarantees that remain robust even under heterogeneous data distributions. The method extends beyond linearly parameterized surrogates to accommodate more complex optimization problems like optimal transport in federated settings.

## Key Results
- FedMM demonstrates superior convergence rates and objective values compared to naive parameter aggregation methods across various data settings
- The framework achieves controlled update sizes in both parameter and surrogate spaces, enhancing stability
- Empirical validation shows FedMM outperforms other federated algorithms in federated dictionary learning and optimal transport map computation tasks
- Theoretical guarantees prove robustness to data heterogeneity without requiring additional assumptions beyond standard bounded gradient and Hessian conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The FedMM framework succeeds by addressing the fundamental mismatch between local and global optimization objectives in federated learning. By aggregating surrogate function parameters rather than model parameters, the method captures more nuanced information about the local optimization landscapes while maintaining global coherence. The control variates effectively compensate for data heterogeneity, allowing clients with different data distributions to contribute meaningfully to the global model. The compression techniques preserve essential information while reducing communication overhead, making the approach practical for real-world deployment.

## Foundational Learning

**Majorize-Minimization (MM) principle**: Iterative optimization technique that replaces complex objective functions with simpler surrogate functions that upper-bound the original objective. Needed for handling non-convex problems in federated settings; quick check: verify surrogate functions satisfy MM conditions (upper-bound property and touching at current iterate).

**Surrogate parameter aggregation**: Strategy of sharing and combining optimization surrogate parameters instead of model parameters. Required to capture local optimization landscape information while maintaining global consistency; quick check: ensure aggregated parameters preserve convergence properties.

**Control variates in optimization**: Variance reduction technique that uses auxiliary variables to compensate for differences between local and global objectives. Essential for handling data heterogeneity without requiring additional assumptions; quick check: verify control variates reduce variance in parameter updates.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Clients (compute local surrogates) -> Central Server (aggregate surrogate parameters) -> Updated global model

**Critical path**: Local surrogate computation → Parameter transmission → Aggregation with control variates → Global model update

**Design tradeoffs**: Parameter aggregation vs. surrogate aggregation (FedMM chooses latter for better heterogeneity handling), communication efficiency vs. information preservation (achieved through compression)

**Failure signatures**: Divergence due to poor surrogate function choice, convergence degradation from aggressive compression, performance degradation when heterogeneity exceeds control variate compensation capacity

**First experiments**: 1) Test FedMM on simple convex problems with known solutions to verify basic functionality, 2) Evaluate convergence under varying levels of data heterogeneity, 3) Measure communication efficiency gains compared to parameter aggregation baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems remains uncertain as theoretical analysis and experiments focus on moderate-scale settings
- Convergence guarantees assume bounded gradient and Hessian conditions that may not hold in all federated learning scenarios
- Extension to non-linearly parameterized surrogates is less theoretically grounded than the main MM framework
- Communication efficiency improvements are demonstrated empirically but lack rigorous comparative analysis across diverse federated learning tasks

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework validity and convergence guarantees for linearly parameterized surrogates
- Medium confidence in empirical superiority of FedMM over naive aggregation methods given limited task diversity in experiments
- Medium confidence in extension to optimal transport problems as methodology is sound but less thoroughly validated
- Low confidence in claimed communication efficiency improvements without more comprehensive comparative analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive experiments on high-dimensional federated learning tasks to verify scalability claims and assess performance degradation
2. Perform rigorous comparative analysis of communication efficiency between FedMM and other federated optimization methods across diverse task types
3. Validate convergence guarantees under relaxed assumptions about gradient and Hessian boundedness in real-world federated learning scenarios
