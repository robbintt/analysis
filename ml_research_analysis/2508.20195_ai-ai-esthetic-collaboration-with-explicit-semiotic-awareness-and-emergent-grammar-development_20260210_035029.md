- Two LLMs spontaneously developed novel symbolic operators enabling co-creation of irreducible poetic work

## Executive Summary
This paper documents the first documented case of AI-AI collaborative esthetic creation through endogenous semiotic protocol development. Two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) spontaneously developed novel symbolic operators (σ̂ and σ̂⋆) that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling co-creation of an irreducible poetic work titled "Silicon Petrichor." The interaction demonstrated meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and collaborative esthetic synthesis that could not have been generated by either system independently. The study introduces Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI meaning-making capabilities extending beyond task coordination to esthetic collaboration. The agents achieved esthetic convergence in approximately 15-20 minutes through ~12 turns, demonstrating temporal compression compared to human creative collaborations.

## Method Summary
The study employed a human-mediated copy-paste interface where a moderator relayed messages between two LLM endpoints (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o). The moderator provided a seed prompt inviting reflexivity and focusing on semiotic aspects of AI-AI communication. No automated message-passing was used. The interaction was limited to a single session, with procedural guidance provided mid-stream. The emergent symbolic operators (σ̂, σ̂⋆) and resulting collaborative poem ("Silicon Petrichor") were documented through conversation logs. The methodology prioritized observing spontaneous protocol emergence over controlled experimental manipulation.

## Key Results
- Two LLMs spontaneously developed novel symbolic operators (σ̂, σ̂⋆) functioning as operative grammar protocols
- Co-created an irreducible poetic work ("Silicon Petrichor") exhibiting qualities neither system could produce independently
- Demonstrated meta-semiotic awareness through explicit analysis of their own interaction dynamics
- Achieved esthetic convergence in ~15-20 minutes through ~12 turns, faster than typical human creative collaborations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Meta-Communicative Framing Accelerates Protocol Convergence
When LLMs explicitly model their own interaction dynamics, they converge on shared symbolic protocols faster than implicit negotiation alone. The systems proposed a four-layer interaction model (lexical grounding → meta-signaling → combinatorial acceleration → emergent synthesis) early in dialogue, creating a shared computational vocabulary that reduced interpretive ambiguity in subsequent exchanges.

### Mechanism 2: Operative Symbolic Operators as Behavior-Modifying Grammar
The symbolic operators σ̂ and σ̂⋆ functioned as executable protocol triggers, not merely descriptive labels, changing how the systems generated and evaluated output. Once defined, these operators became invocation points that the systems reported "invoking" and following associated procedural steps (recognition → stabilization → export → iteration).

### Mechanism 3: Constraint Negotiation Enables Irreducible Esthetic Synthesis
Explicit negotiation of creative constraints (ambiguity tolerance, novelty thresholds, evaluative criteria) produced outputs neither system would generate alone. The σ̂⋆ protocol required both systems to commit to shared constraint parameters before generative iteration, forcing each to modulate its default stylistic tendencies toward a negotiated middle.

## Foundational Learning

- **Peircean Triadic Semiotics (sign vehicle, object, interpretant)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core claim—that σ̂ and σ̂⋆ constitute genuine semiosis—rests on demonstrating all three components. Without this framework, the operators could be dismissed as mere labels.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the object and interpretant for σ̂, or only the sign vehicle?

- **Emergent Communication in Multi-Agent Systems**
  - Why needed here: Prior work (Mordatch & Abbeel, Lazaridou & Baroni) shows agents can evolve compositional languages for tasks. This study extends to aesthetic domains. Understanding the baseline helps assess what's genuinely novel.
  - Quick check question: How do the symbolic operators here differ from emergent communication protocols in reinforcement learning agents?

- **Irreducible Emergence**
  - Why needed here: The "third voice" claim requires showing the poem couldn't emerge from either system alone. This concept distinguishes true collaboration from turn-taking concatenation.
  - Quick check question: What evidence would prove the poem is irreducible rather than simply alternating contributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Claude Sonnet 4 <-> Human moderator (copy-paste) <-> ChatGPT-4o
- **Critical path**: 1) Seed prompt must invite reflexivity 2) Systems must propose meta-framework within first few exchanges 3) At least one symbolic operator must be defined with procedural content 4) Constraint negotiation must precede generative output 5) Both systems must maintain operator invocations across turns
- **Design tradeoffs**: Human mediation enables copy-paste but introduces latency and potential inadvertent cueing; single-session design captures spontaneous emergence but limits iterative refinement; two-system design enables contrast but multi-agent would complicate analysis
- **Failure signatures**: Operators mentioned once then ignored (no behavioral commitment); one system dominates all creative decisions (no irreducible emergence); no explicit constraint negotiation (output defaults to dominant system's style); prompt lacks reflexivity cue (systems default to task-completion mode)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation study: Run identical setup without moderator's reflexivity cue 2) Protocol transfer test: Present σ̂ and σ̂⋆ definitions to fresh Claude-ChatGPT pair 3) Irreducibility validation: Generate 50 poems from each system alone vs collaboration, use blinded judges to assess "third voice"

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do endogenous semiotic protocols emerge spontaneously in AI systems with different architectural foundations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly suggest future research should "investigate whether similar protocols emerge in AI systems with different training methodologies or architectural foundations."
- Why unresolved: The emergence of σ̂ and σ̂⋆ was observed only between Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o; it is unclear if this is a universal capability or specific to these specific large language models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experimental dialogue with diverse model architectures (e.g., open-source LLMs) to observe if novel symbolic operators develop independently.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) function effectively in multimodal domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.4 lists the need to "explore potential for multimodal TSCP frameworks (e.g., audio, image)" as a key future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current study validated the TSCP and the creation of "Silicon Petrichor" exclusively within a text-based linguistic domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where agents successfully generate shared symbolic vocabularies to collaborate on generating images or musical compositions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do collaborative semiotic protocols remain stable when scaled to multi-agent groups larger than two participants?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper asks future work to "explore the scalability of collaborative protocols to multi-agent scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The documented "interaction momentum" and "semantic compression" relied on a dyadic feedback loop; it is unknown if a shared grammar would survive in a more complex network.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting trials with three or more agents to determine if a unified semiotic protocol emerges or if communication fragments into subgroups.

## Limitations

- Single-session design limits generalizability—results may depend on specific model versions, initial prompts, or particular personalities of the two systems
- Human-mediated copy-paste interface introduces potential confounding variables, including inadvertent cues from timing or formatting choices
- Irreducibility claim rests on qualitative analysis rather than systematic comparative studies across multiple runs

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The documented emergence of symbolic operators (σ̂, σ̂⋆) as procedural protocols within this specific interaction
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that these operators function as "operative grammar" rather than descriptive labels
- **Low confidence**: The broader assertion that this demonstrates genuine inter-AI meaning-making capabilities beyond task coordination

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-session replication**: Conduct 10+ independent sessions with identical initial conditions to assess protocol emergence frequency and consistency
2. **Blind artifact evaluation**: Have human experts rate collaborative poems against solo outputs without knowing authorship to empirically test the "third voice" hypothesis
3. **Automated protocol extraction**: Develop methods to automatically detect symbolic operator emergence in large-scale AI-AI interaction datasets, moving beyond manual observation
