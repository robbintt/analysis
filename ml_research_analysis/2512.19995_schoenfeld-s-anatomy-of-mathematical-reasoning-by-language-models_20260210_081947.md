## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ThinkARM, a scalable framework that applies Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to automatically analyze the reasoning traces of large language models (LLMs). By categorizing each sentence in reasoning traces into eight functional episodes—such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, and Verify—the method enables fine-grained, interpretable insights into how LLMs structure their problem-solving. Applied to 15 diverse models solving 100 math problems, ThinkARM reveals consistent cognitive dynamics, showing that reasoning models progress from abstract analysis to concrete execution and end with verification. The approach also uncovers that exploration serves as a branching step tied to correctness, and that efficient reasoning methods selectively suppress evaluative episodes. Overall, ThinkARM makes the internal reasoning process explicit, supporting systematic analysis and diagnosis of reasoning behaviors in LLMs.

## Method Summary
ThinkARM is a scalable framework that applies Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to analyze LLM reasoning traces. The method categorizes each sentence in a reasoning trace into eight functional episodes: Analysis, Design, Exploration, Implementation, Verification, Evaluation, Insight, and Previous Knowledge. For each sentence, a binary classifier determines whether it belongs to each episode type. The framework then analyzes episode frequency, sequence patterns, and the relationship between episodes and reasoning correctness. Applied to 15 models solving 100 math problems from the MATH dataset, ThinkARM reveals consistent cognitive dynamics across models and provides interpretable insights into how LLMs structure their problem-solving processes.

## Key Results
- ThinkARM successfully categorizes LLM reasoning traces into eight functional episodes with consistent patterns across 15 diverse models
- Reasoning models consistently progress from Analysis (abstract stage) through Implementation (concrete stage) to Verification as the final step
- Exploration episodes serve as critical branching points in reasoning, with models exploring multiple directions before selecting the most promising path
- Efficient reasoning methods selectively suppress evaluative episodes, suggesting optimization of the reasoning process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ThinkARM works by providing a structured framework for analyzing the internal reasoning processes of LLMs through the lens of Schoenfeld's Episode Theory. By categorizing each sentence in reasoning traces into functional episodes, the method makes the implicit reasoning process explicit and interpretable. The binary classifier for each episode type enables systematic analysis of reasoning patterns, while the analysis of episode sequences and their relationship to correctness reveals the cognitive dynamics underlying LLM problem-solving. This structured approach allows researchers to diagnose reasoning behaviors, identify efficient patterns, and understand how models progress from abstract analysis to concrete implementation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Schoenfeld's Episode Theory**: A framework for analyzing mathematical problem-solving that categorizes reasoning into functional episodes (why needed: provides theoretical foundation for analyzing reasoning traces; quick check: can you identify the eight episode types and their roles?)
- **MATH dataset**: A benchmark dataset containing 100 challenging mathematics problems used to evaluate reasoning models (why needed: provides standardized problem set for testing; quick check: what types of mathematical problems are included?)
- **Binary classification for episode detection**: Each sentence in reasoning traces is classified as belonging or not belonging to each episode type (why needed: enables systematic categorization of reasoning steps; quick check: how does the classifier handle ambiguous sentences?)
- **Episode frequency analysis**: Examining how often each episode type appears in reasoning traces (why needed: reveals patterns in reasoning structure; quick check: what episode patterns are consistent across models?)
- **Sequence pattern analysis**: Studying the order in which episodes appear in reasoning traces (why needed: uncovers the progression of reasoning; quick check: what is the typical progression from analysis to verification?)
- **Correctness-responsiveness**: Analyzing how episode patterns relate to reasoning accuracy (why needed: identifies effective reasoning strategies; quick check: how does exploration relate to correctness?)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
User Problem -> Reasoning Trace Generation -> Sentence-by-Sentence Classification -> Episode Assignment -> Pattern Analysis -> Model Comparison

**Critical Path**
Problem input → LLM reasoning generation → Sentence tokenization → Binary classification per episode type → Episode sequence reconstruction → Statistical analysis of patterns

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Episode granularity vs. computational efficiency (more episodes provide finer analysis but increase classification complexity)
- Binary vs. multi-class classification (binary allows independent episode detection but may miss episode combinations)
- Static vs. adaptive episode definitions (fixed episodes enable comparison but may not capture all reasoning patterns)

**Failure Signatures**
- Models with low verification episodes may skip critical checking steps
- Excessive exploration without implementation suggests inefficient reasoning
- Missing analysis episodes indicates jumping to solutions without proper understanding
- Inconsistent episode patterns across similar problems suggests unreliable reasoning

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare episode patterns between correct and incorrect reasoning traces to identify markers of successful problem-solving
2. Analyze how different prompting strategies affect episode distribution and reasoning efficiency
3. Test the framework on non-mathematical domains to evaluate cross-domain applicability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis relies on a specific problem set (MATH dataset with 100 problems) and 15 selected models, limiting scope
- Episode categorization may not capture all reasoning patterns, particularly for non-mathematical domains
- Claims about underlying cognitive processes remain inferred from surface traces rather than directly observed

## Confidence
- Methodological framework: High
- Application to mathematical reasoning: High
- Generalizability across domains and problem types: Medium
- Claims about underlying cognitive processes: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test ThinkARM on diverse problem domains (scientific reasoning, coding, commonsense) to evaluate cross-domain applicability and identify domain-specific episode patterns
2. Conduct human validation studies comparing LLM reasoning traces with expert human problem-solving sessions to assess whether identified episodes align with actual cognitive processes
3. Apply the framework to more complex mathematical problems requiring multi-step derivations and proofs to determine if episode patterns hold under increased reasoning complexity
