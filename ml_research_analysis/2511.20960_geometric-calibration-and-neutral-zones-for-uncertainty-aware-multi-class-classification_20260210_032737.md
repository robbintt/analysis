## Executive Summary
This paper develops a geometric framework for uncertainty-aware multi-class classification that addresses the critical gap between calibration and instance-level uncertainty quantification. The method treats probability outputs as points on the (c-1)-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric, enabling principled calibration via affine transformations in ALR space and geometric reliability scores for uncertainty quantification. The two-stage framework first applies additive log-ratio calibration that reduces exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems while extending naturally to multi-class settings, then computes reliability scores based on Fisher-Rao distance to simplex vertices to identify predictions warranting human review.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of two stages: (1) geometric calibration via additive log-ratio (ALR) transforms, where probabilities are mapped to unconstrained log-ratios, calibrated via affine transformations, then mapped back; and (2) reliability scoring using Fisher-Rao distance to simplex vertices, where predictions are assigned scores R = exp(-λ·d_FR(p, ê_j)) that quantify instance-level uncertainty. The calibration parameters are learned by minimizing log-loss with regularization constraints (A ⪰ δI, tr(A) = c-1), while thresholds are selected to satisfy P(error | R ≥ τ) ≤ α for neutral zone operation.

## Key Results
- Captures 72.5% of errors while deferring 34.5% of samples in AAV classification
- Reduces automated decision error rates from 16.8% to 6.9% (2.4× improvement)
- Achieves 0.80 AUC-ROC for error detection, demonstrating strong discrimination between correct and incorrect predictions
- Calibration alone yields only marginal accuracy gains; operational benefit primarily from reliability scoring mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Affine transformation in ALR space corrects systematic miscalibration while respecting simplex constraints.
- Mechanism: The ALR transform maps probability vectors to unconstrained log-ratios, where calibration becomes a well-posed regression problem. The learned matrix A corrects multiplicative bias (scaling/rotation in log-ratio space) while vector b corrects additive bias. Regularization toward identity (A≈I, b≈0) implements a "minimal intervention" prior.
- Core assumption: Miscalibration is approximately linear in ALR coordinates; the true calibration map is close to identity for well-trained networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems"
  - [Section 2.2.1] "The affine structure provides sufficient flexibility to capture common miscalibration patterns (overconfidence, class-specific bias) while remaining identifiable"
  - [corpus] Limited direct validation; corpus neighbor on "Structured Matrix Scaling" mentions parametric logistic approaches but doesn't confirm ALR-specific gains.
- Break condition: Nonlinear miscalibration patterns that affine transforms cannot capture; extreme class imbalance where ALR coordinates become unstable near zero probabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fisher-Rao distance to predicted class vertex provides instance-level reliability that ECE cannot.
- Mechanism: Reliability score R = exp(-λ·d_FR(p, ê_j)) converts geometric distance to a [0,1] scale. Predictions near vertices (high confidence, likely correct) score high; predictions near simplex center (ambiguous) score low. The exponential decay with distance creates natural separation between reliable and unreliable predictions.
- Core assumption: Geometric proximity to vertices correlates with correctness—a form of "confidence reflects competence."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "geometric reliability scores based on Fisher-Rao distance to simplex vertices to identify predictions warranting human review"
  - [Section 4.5.1] "Correct predictions (n=259) concentrate at high reliability with mean R=0.579, while errors (n=51) concentrate at low reliability with mean R=0.371"
  - [corpus] Neighbor paper "Uncertainty-Aware Post-Hoc Calibration" addresses similar instance-level reliability but uses different methodology; no direct validation of Fisher-Rao specifically.
- Break condition: Systematic errors where the model is confidently wrong (high probability on wrong class, close to wrong vertex).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Threshold-based neutral zones achieve 2.1× better error capture than random deferral.
- Mechanism: The threshold τ* is learned to satisfy P(error | R ≥ τ*) ≤ α. This creates a Pareto frontier: higher deferral → lower automated error rate. The key insight is that R provides discriminatory power—errors cluster in low-R regions.
- Core assumption: The reliability score induces monotone likelihood ratio ordering (Conjecture 1, unproven).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "captures 72.5% of errors while deferring 34.5% of samples"
  - [Section 4.6] "random selection yields no improvement (expected error rate remains 16.8%). Our method achieves 6.9%—a 2.4× reduction"
  - [corpus] No corpus validation of neutral zone efficiency claims.
- Break condition: Distribution shift between calibration and deployment; threshold overfitting to small validation sets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Fisher-Rao geometry on probability simplex**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework treats probability outputs as points on a Riemannian manifold. Without understanding that the simplex has intrinsic geometry (not Euclidean), the calibration and reliability mechanisms are opaque.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we just use Euclidean distance between probability vectors instead of Fisher-Rao distance?

- Concept: **Compositional data and log-ratio transforms**
  - Why needed here: The ALR transform is the bridge between simplex geometry and tractable optimization. Understanding why log-ratios (not raw probabilities) are the natural coordinate system is essential.
  - Quick check question: What constraint does the simplex impose that ALR transforms remove?

- Concept: **Sub-Gaussian concentration and sample complexity**
  - Why needed here: Theorem 2's value is enabling sample size calculations before data collection. Understanding sub-Gaussian parameters lets you use these bounds practically.
  - Quick check question: Given σ² = 0.23 from Theorem 2, how many samples guarantee P(|R - E[R]| > 0.1) ≤ 0.01?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw CNN logits → Softmax → p_CNN → ALR transform → Affine calibration (A, b) → Inverse ALR → p_cal → Fisher-Rao distance to ê_j → R = exp(-λ·d) → Compare to τ* → {Automated decision, Defer to human}

- Critical path: Calibration parameter learning (requires labeled validation set) → Threshold learning (requires choosing α) → Deployment inference (O(1) per sample after calibration)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Deferral rate vs. error rate**: Pareto frontier in Figure 6; operating point selection depends on cost of human review vs. cost of errors
  - **Regularization strength (λ₁, λ₂)**: Stronger regularization → more stable but potentially underfit calibration
  - **Reliability sensitivity (λ)**: Higher λ → more discriminative scores but same empirical AUC

- Failure signatures:
  - Calibration matrix A loses positive definiteness → check λ_min(A) > 0 during optimization
  - All predictions in neutral zone → τ* too aggressive or model fundamentally unreliable
  - Neutral zone captures <50% of errors at high deferral → reliability score not discriminating; check for systematic confident-wrong errors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Convergence validation**: Subsample calibration data (n ∈ {100, 250, 500, 750}) and measure parameter stability ||T̂_n - T̂_full|| to verify bootstrap behavior matches theoretical rate.
  2. **Threshold sensitivity**: Sweep τ across [0.3, 0.7] and plot error-capture vs. deferral curve; verify smooth Pareto frontier exists.
  3. **Baseline comparison**: Apply reliability scoring to temperature scaling and Platt scaling outputs; verify similar AUC (~0.80) confirming mechanism is method-agnostic per Table 5.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the reliability score R = exp(-λ·d_FR(p,ê_j)) induce a monotone likelihood ratio ordering, making threshold tests on R Neyman-Pearson optimal for the error vs. correct hypothesis test?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conjecture 1 states this conjecture with supporting empirical evidence (72.5% error capture at 34.5% deferral, 2.1× improvement over random) and theoretical motivation via Bhattacharyya coefficients, but notes it "lacks rigorous proof."
- Why unresolved: Proving monotone likelihood ratio property requires characterizing the joint distribution of (R, correctness) which depends on the interplay between the calibration map and data distribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof establishing P(correct|R₁)/P(error|R₁) > P(correct|R₂)/P(error|R₂) for R₁ > R₂, or a counterexample showing violations under specific distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the geometric calibration framework scale to high-dimensional multi-class settings with c >> 3 classes, and what failure modes emerge?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The framework's behavior in high-dimensional settings (c ≫ 3) and under distribution shift remains to be demonstrated."
- Why unresolved: Empirical validation was confined to c=3 classes (AAV classification); the ALR parameterization has dimension (c-1)² + (c-1), and regularization effectiveness may degrade as parameter space grows relative to calibration sample size.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments on datasets with c ∈ {10, 50, 100} classes, analyzing convergence, calibration quality, and neutral zone effectiveness as dimension increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise relationship between the effective dimension of the calibration parameter space and the observed faster-than-n^(-1/2) convergence rate?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Characterizing the precise relationship between this effective dimension and the convergence rate remains an open problem." Remark 11 reports empirical slope -0.82 with caveats about target mismatch and regularization effects.
- Why unresolved: The observed super-efficiency may arise from low-rank structure in the ALR covariance or regularization constraints, but the mechanism is not characterized theoretically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation studies with known population parameters T* measuring convergence T̂_n → T* (not to empirical optimum), plus theoretical analysis linking Hessian eigenvalue decay to convergence acceleration.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes approximately linear miscalibration patterns in ALR space, which may fail for highly nonlinear probability distortions
- Systematic confident-wrong errors would break the reliability score mechanism, as these predictions are geometrically close to the wrong vertex
- Performance under distribution shift between calibration and deployment is unexplored, limiting real-world applicability

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Theoretical consistency results (Theorem 1) and concentration bounds (Theorem 2) are mathematically rigorous given stated assumptions. The Pareto frontier existence is well-established from the proof structure.
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical results on AAV classification show the framework works in one application domain, but performance may not generalize across domains with different calibration characteristics or class distributions.
- **Low confidence**: The conjecture about monotone likelihood ratio ordering (Conjecture 1) lacks proof, and the threshold selection method's optimality depends on this unproven property.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to nonlinear miscalibration**: Apply the framework to synthetic datasets where calibration maps follow quadratic or exponential patterns in ALR space, and measure degradation in performance.
2. **Systematic error vulnerability**: Construct test cases with high-confidence incorrect predictions and evaluate whether reliability scores still discriminate effectively.
3. **Cross-domain generalization**: Evaluate the framework on image classification (CIFAR-10/100) and NLP sentiment analysis tasks to verify performance consistency across different probability distributions and network architectures.
