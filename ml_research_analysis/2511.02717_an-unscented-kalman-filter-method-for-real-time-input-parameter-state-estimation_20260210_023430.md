# An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.02717
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02717
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** Joint input-parameter-state estimation for structural systems using a two-stage unscented Kalman filter.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method for real-time joint estimation of unknown inputs, system parameters, and dynamic states in structural systems. The method introduces a two-stage input estimation process within each time step to minimize error propagation. The approach is validated on both linear and nonlinear systems, demonstrating satisfactory convergence of input, state, and parameter estimates. The paper also establishes identifiability conditions, showing that systems require at least one known input (zero or non-zero) for unique parameter identification.

## Method Summary
The IPS-UKF method augments the state vector to include system parameters alongside dynamic states, allowing joint estimation through sigma point propagation. The key innovation is a two-stage input estimation process: first predicting the input from dynamic states and parameters, then refining it using updated measurements. The algorithm handles nonlinearities without requiring Jacobian derivatives, using the Unscented Transform to approximate posterior distributions. Process and measurement noise covariances are critical for convergence, requiring careful calibration.

## Key Results
- Joint input-parameter-state estimation achieved for both linear and nonlinear systems with satisfactory convergence
- Two-stage input estimation process minimizes error propagation within each time step
- Systems require at least one known input (zero or non-zero) for unique parameter identification
- Full state measurements (displacement, velocity, acceleration) recommended for reliable estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Two-Stage Input Estimation
- **Claim:** The system input is estimated in a dual-stage process within a single time step to minimize error propagation.
- **Mechanism:** First, the algorithm estimates the unknown input using predicted states and parameters ($G(\cdot)$ function). This estimated input is used for the measurement update. Second, after the states and parameters are corrected by measurements, the input is re-estimated using these updated values to provide the final estimation for the step.
- **Core assumption:** The dynamic equation of motion can be rearranged to solve for input ($u$) given states and parameters.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The unknown input is estimated in two stages... Firstly, the predicted dynamic states... Secondly, the corrected with measurements states..."
  - [section 3] "This final $u^e_k$ is successively used at the prediction calculation of the next step $k + 1$."
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers like "A Kullback-Leibler divergence method..." explore selection strategies for similar estimation challenges, indicating active research in robust dual-estimation.
- **Break condition:** If the initial parameter guess causes the first-stage input estimation to deviate massively from reality, the measurement update may diverge before the second-stage correction can stabilize it.

### Mechanism 2: State-Space Augmentation
- **Claim:** Joint estimation of states and parameters is achieved by augmenting the state vector, allowing the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to handle nonlinearities without Jacobian derivatives.
- **Mechanism:** The state vector $z$ is augmented to include system parameters $\theta$ alongside dynamic states ($x, \dot{x}$). The UKF uses sigma points to propagate this augmented state through the nonlinear process model, capturing the mean and covariance estimates without linearizing the model.
- **Core assumption:** The system parameters vary slowly enough to be treated as states with negligible process noise relative to dynamic states.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2] "The state vector $z(t) = [x(t), \dot{x(t)}, \theta]^T$ includes the parameters..."
  - [section 1] "Here, Jacobian derivatives, least square introductions... will not be needed."
  - [corpus] Evidence regarding this specific mechanism is weak in the provided corpus neighbors (which focus on neural/adaptive variants), but standard UKF literature supports this derivation.
- **Break condition:** If the nonlinearity is severe and the sampling rate is too low, the sigma point spread may fail to capture the true distribution, leading to filter divergence.

### Mechanism 3: Identifiability Condition
- **Claim:** Unique identifiability of a system with unknown input requires at least one known input (zero or non-zero) to resolve the algebraic ambiguity between parameter errors and input errors.
- **Mechanism:** Perturbation analysis demonstrates that an error in stiffness ($\Delta k$) can mathematically cancel out an error in input ($\Delta u$) in the equation of motion. A known input boundary condition (e.g., a DOF with zero force) breaks this symmetry, allowing the filter to distinguish between system dynamics and external forcing.
- **Core assumption:** The system has at least one degree of freedom where the input is known or zero.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially be uniquely identified."
  - [section 4] Eq. (10) shows the mathematical equivalence of errors; Eq. (12) shows how a known input at DOF 1 invalidates the "equivalent" wrong solution.
  - [corpus] Not explicitly covered in the provided corpus summaries.
- **Break condition:** If the "known" input is falsely assumed (e.g., assuming zero input when environmental noise exists), the system will likely converge to incorrect parameters that compensate for the hidden input.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: State-Space Augmentation**
  - **Why needed here:** To track unchanging (or slowly changing) system properties like stiffness ($k$) and damping ($c$) alongside dynamic variables ($x, \dot{x}$), they must be included in the state vector.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you formulate the state vector for a simple mass-spring system where the spring stiffness is an unknown variable to be estimated?

- **Concept: Sigma Point Propagation (Unscented Transform)**
  - **Why needed here:** Unlike the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the UKF does not use Jacobians. Understanding how sigma points are selected and propagated is essential to diagnosing filter performance in nonlinear regimes.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the UKF approximate the posterior mean of a nonlinear function compared to linearizing the function first?

- **Concept: Observability and Identifiability**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper highlights that knowing the full state does not guarantee parameter identification if the input is unknown.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does knowing that the input is zero at a specific degree of freedom help identify the stiffness at a different degree of freedom?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** State Vector -> Process Model -> Input Estimator -> UKF Core -> Measurement Update
- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize augmented state and covariance ($P_0$)
  2. **Loop Start:** Generate Sigma Points
  3. **Stage 1:** Predict Input $u_{pred}$ using *prior* states
  4. **Time Update:** Propagate states using $u_{pred}$
  5. **Measurement Update:** Correct states/parameters using sensor data ($y$)
  6. **Stage 2:** Refine Input $u_{final}$ using *updated* states
  7. Repeat
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Sensor Availability:** Full state measurement (disp, vel, accel) is recommended for stability, but sensitivity analysis suggests acceleration-only is unreliable for this method due to drift and lack of identifiability
  - **Covariance Tuning:** The paper notes that process ($Q$) and measurement ($R$) noise covariances are critical for convergence, often requiring values smaller than actual noise levels (e.g., $10^{-9}$) to enforce rigid parameter constraints
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Divergence:** Parameters drifting to bounds or physically impossible values (negative stiffness)
  - **Input Drift:** Estimated input showing a low-frequency trend that correlates with state estimation errors (see Section 1 references to other methods)
  - **Algebraic Loop:** If the known input condition is not met, the filter may appear stable but converge to a "ghost" system where parameter errors perfectly cancel input errors
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Linear Validation:** Replicate the 3-DOF linear example (Section 5.1) with known mass and full state measurement to verify the two-stage input estimation logic
  2. **Nonlinear Stress Test:** Introduce the Duffing oscillator (Section 5.2) to ensure the UKF handles the cubic stiffness term without Jacobians
  3. **Sensor Fidelity Check:** Attempt to run the nonlinear example using acceleration-only data to observe the "misleading and unreliable" results described in Section 6, verifying the identifiability constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can an automated or physically meaningful procedure be developed to optimally calibrate the process and measurement covariance matrices ($Q$ and $R$) for the IPS-UKF?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states that "the proper calibration is outside the scope of this work," despite noting that these matrices play a vital role in correct convergence.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper relies on constant, manually tuned values (e.g., $10^{-9}$) which may not be robust for varying system conditions or noise levels.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A subsequent study proposing an adaptive filtering scheme or a theoretical framework that defines these matrices based on system physics rather than heuristic tuning.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the methodology be modified to successfully perform joint input-parameter-state estimation using only acceleration measurements?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 6 demonstrates that the acceleration-only measurement case results in "misleading and unreliable" estimates with diverging errors, creating a practical limitation for common sensor setups.
- **Why unresolved:** The current two-stage input estimation appears to suffer from drift and lack of absolute reference (displacement/velocity) when integrating acceleration data in an unknown input context.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A successful numerical or experimental application of the modified method on a nonlinear system using only acceleration response data.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the proposed method computationally tractable for real-time monitoring of large-scale structural systems with high degrees of freedom?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The numerical examples are limited to small 2-DOF and 3-DOF systems; the authors do not address the "curse of dimensionality" associated with generating sigma points in high-dimensional UKF implementations.
- **Why unresolved:** The computational cost of the Unscented Kalman Filter scales with the state dimension, potentially hindering application to complex finite element models without further optimization.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Demonstration of the algorithm's real-time capability on a structural system with a significantly larger number of degrees of freedom (e.g., > 100 DOFs).

## Limitations

- **Identifiability Constraint:** The method requires at least one known input (zero or non-zero) for unique parameter identification, which is a fundamental limitation not a filter flaw.
- **Covariance Tuning Sensitivity:** The process and measurement noise covariances require careful manual tuning, often with values much smaller than actual noise levels, suggesting limited robustness.
- **Measurement Requirements:** The method is unreliable with only acceleration measurements without data fusion, limiting practical deployment in many sensor configurations.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The two-stage input estimation mechanism is clearly described and its purpose is explicitly stated.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim of successful convergence on nonlinear systems is supported, but the specific nonlinearity severity impact is not deeply explored.
- **Medium Confidence:** The perturbation analysis proving the need for a known input is mathematically sound, but practical implications are not discussed.
- **Low Confidence:** Specific values for initial state covariance matrix and exact UKF parameters used in examples are not provided.

## Next Checks

1. **Identifiability Test:** Replicate the linear 3-DOF example, but deliberately violate the known input condition (e.g., remove the zero-input constraint at DOF 1). Verify that the filter converges to incorrect parameters that mathematically satisfy the equation of motion but are physically wrong.

2. **Nonlinear Stress Test:** Implement the Duffing oscillator example and systematically increase the cubic stiffness coefficient ($k_3$) to assess at what point the UKF's sigma point approximation fails to capture the true posterior distribution, leading to filter divergence.

3. **Measurement Sensitivity Analysis:** Run the nonlinear example using only acceleration measurements, first without data fusion and then with a simple numerical integration scheme for velocity/displacement. Compare the parameter estimation accuracy and convergence speed to the full-state case to quantify the practical limitations of partial measurements.
