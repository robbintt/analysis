## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23139
- Authors: Sipeng Chen; Yan Zhang; Shibo Li
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OptiINR achieves 41.38 dB and 46.24 dB PSNR on Kodak and DIV2K images, improving over baselines by 1.14-3.39 dB.

## Executive Summary
OptiINR addresses the challenge of optimally configuring implicit neural representations by formulating the problem as a global optimization over mixed-variable spaces (activations and initialization parameters). The method uses Bayesian optimization with a product kernel to efficiently explore activation families (SIREN, WIRE, FINER, Gaussian, etc.) and their continuous hyperparameters. Across diverse tasks including 2D image representation, 1D audio reconstruction, and 3D shape modeling, OptiINR consistently discovers configurations that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins. On image datasets Kodak and DIV2K, OptiINR achieves 41.38 dB and 46.24 dB PSNR respectively, improving over best baselines by 1.14-3.39 dB. For audio reconstruction, gains reach 5.90-12.03 dB over competing methods. The approach demonstrates that principled, automated configuration search can substantially outperform manual tuning while revealing novel architectural insights.

## Method Summary
OptiINR formulates INR configuration as a global optimization problem over mixed-variable spaces, combining categorical activation families and continuous hyperparameters. The method employs Bayesian optimization with a product kernel (Matérn for continuous, Squared Exponential with ARD for categorical) to handle this heterogeneous search space. For efficient acquisition function computation, Matheron's rule reduces posterior sampling complexity from O(Sn³) to O(n³ + Sn²). The optimization runs for 100 iterations with 30 Latin Hypercube initial samples, using a 4-layer MLP architecture with 256 hidden units. Each configuration is evaluated by training the INR for 10,000 epochs using AdamW with learning rate 1e-4, measuring PSNR for images/audio or IoU for 3D shapes.

## Key Results
- On Kodak images: OptiINR achieves 41.38 dB PSNR, improving over best baselines by 1.14-3.39 dB
- On DIV2K images: OptiINR achieves 46.24 dB PSNR, improving over best baselines by 1.14-3.39 dB
- On audio reconstruction: OptiINR achieves gains of 5.90-12.03 dB over competing methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
A product kernel over mixed-variable spaces enables Bayesian optimization to jointly optimize discrete activation families and continuous hyperparameters. The composite kernel $k(\Lambda, \Lambda') = k_{cont}(\Lambda_c, \Lambda'_c) \times k_{cat}(\Lambda_{cat}, \Lambda'_{cat})$ separates modeling of continuous parameters (Matérn kernel) from categorical activations (Squared Exponential on one-hot encodings with ARD). This preserves valid PSD properties via the Schur product theorem, allowing the GP surrogate to capture correlations across the heterogeneous configuration space. Core assumption: Performance over the configuration space is sufficiently smooth for the GP prior to provide useful uncertainty estimates.

### Mechanism 2
Global joint optimization over all layers discovers configurations that greedy layer-wise selection cannot. Each layer's optimal activation and initialization depends on choices made for all other layers. Greedy approaches fix earlier layers before optimizing later ones, trapping search in local optima. OptiINR's global formulation $\Lambda^* = \arg\max_{\Lambda \in \mathcal{L}} f(\Lambda)$ evaluates complete network configurations, allowing the acquisition function to propose configurations where layer interdependencies are exploited. Core assumption: Layer interdependencies are significant enough that local greedy improvements do not cascade to global optima.

### Mechanism 3
Matheron's rule reduces posterior sampling complexity from O(Sn³) to O(n³ + Sn²), enabling Monte Carlo acquisition without approximation error. Rather than computing Cholesky decomposition per sample, Matheron's rule expresses posterior samples as $f_{post}(\cdot) \stackrel{d}{=} f_{prior}(\cdot) + k(\cdot, X)[K + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1}(y - f_{prior}(X))$. The expensive matrix inversion is computed once; subsequent samples require only matrix-vector products. Core assumption: The GP prior can be sampled efficiently (e.g., via random Fourier features) and the number of observations n remains manageable for exact matrix operations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Process Regression**
  - Why needed here: OptiINR's surrogate model is a GP; understanding posterior prediction $\mu(\lambda^*)$, variance $\sigma^2(\lambda^*)$, and kernel properties is essential for interpreting acquisition behavior.
  - Quick check question: Given a GP with RBF kernel and 10 observations, what happens to posterior variance far from observed points?

- **Bayesian Optimization Acquisition Functions**
  - Why needed here: Expected Improvement balances exploration (high uncertainty) and exploitation (high predicted mean); Monte Carlo EEI generalizes this to batch settings.
  - Quick check question: If EI always selects the point with highest predicted mean, what property of the GP posterior is being ignored?

- **Spectral Bias in Neural Networks**
  - Why needed here: INRs struggle to learn high-frequency components; activation choice (SIREN, WIRE, FINER) directly addresses this. The paper's mechanism connects configuration to NTK spectral properties.
  - Quick check question: Why does a standard MLP with ReLU activations tend to produce overly smooth reconstructions of high-frequency signals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Configuration Space L → Latin Hypercube Initial Samples → INR Training + Evaluation → GP Surrogate with Product Kernel ← Observations D_t ← PSNR/Performance → Matheron-based Posterior Sampling → Monte Carlo EEI → Acquisition Argmax → Next Configuration Λ_{t+1}

- Critical path:
  1. Define search space: categorical activations per layer + continuous hyperparameters (frequency $\omega_0$, scales $s_0$, layer learning rates)
  2. Initialize GP with product kernel; sample $N_{init}=30$ configurations via Latin Hypercube
  3. For each iteration: fit GP, compute EEI via Matheron sampling ($S$ posterior samples), select $\Lambda_{t+1}$, train INR, update observations
  4. Return best observed configuration after $T=100$ total evaluations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Exploration vs. exploitation**: EI's $f_{best}$ threshold determines how aggressively to explore uncertain regions. Lower $S$ (samples) reduces compute but increases EEI variance
  - **Search space granularity**: Including all activation families increases categorical dimensionality; restricting to task-relevant subsets (e.g., {SIREN, FINER} for audio) focuses search
  - **Exact vs. approximate GP**: Matheron's rule is exact but scales cubically with $n$; inducing-point approximations scale better but introduce bias

- Failure signatures:
  - **No improvement after 20+ iterations**: Likely kernel hyperparameters mis-specified or search space too large; check GP fit quality
  - **High variance in EEI across runs**: Insufficient posterior samples ($S$ too small); increase $S$ or check prior sampling
  - **All selected configurations similar**: Acquisition over-exploiting; verify $\sigma^2$ estimates are non-zero and acquisition is computing improvement correctly
  - **OOM during matrix inversion**: Observation count $n$ too large for exact GP; switch to sparse approximation or reduce initial samples

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check on single image**: Run OptiINR on one Kodak image with restricted search space {SIREN, WIRE} for 30 iterations. Verify GP posterior variance decreases near observed points and EEI selects diverse configurations
  2. **Ablation on kernel choice**: Compare product kernel vs. treating all variables as continuous (one-hot without ARD) on the same task. Expect degraded performance if categorical structure matters
  3. **Scalability test**: Run full 130-evaluation optimization on DIV2K patch; log time per iteration, track Cholesky decomposition cost, and verify Matheron speedup by comparing per-sample time against naive posterior sampling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the discovered configurations transfer effectively to unseen signals, or are they strictly task-specific? Basis in paper: The paper explicitly distinguishes OptiINR from meta-learning (Page 4) and concludes that optimal designs are "strongly task-dependent" (Page 14), leaving the potential for transfer learning or generalizable configuration priors unexplored. Why unresolved: The framework optimizes configurations for single, specific signals (e.g., one image) and does not test if an optimal configuration for one signal generalizes to another. What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation measuring the performance drop when applying a configuration optimized on a source signal (e.g., a specific image texture) to a target signal with similar or differing spectral properties.

### Open Question 2
Does the theoretical link between the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) spectrum and optimal configuration allow for analytical selection without empirical search? Basis in paper: Appendix D.2 claims that configuration optimization acts as a proxy for aligning the NTK's spectral properties with the target signal (Claim 1), but the paper relies entirely on empirical Bayesian Optimization to find this alignment. Why unresolved: The paper establishes the theoretical connection but does not propose or validate a method to predict the optimal configuration analytically based on the target signal's frequency content. What evidence would resolve it: A study correlating the spectral density of the target signal with the optimal activation parameters, showing that theoretical spectral matching predicts the empirical optima found by OptiINR.

### Open Question 3
Can the mixed-variable optimization framework scale to include network topology (depth and width) without destabilizing the convergence guarantees? Basis in paper: The "Experimental Protocol" (Page 9) explicitly fixes the network architecture (4 layers, 256 hidden units) to isolate the impact of activation configurations. Why unresolved: It is unknown if the performance gains are dependent on the fixed capacity or if the product kernel handles the increased dimensionality of structural hyperparameters effectively. What evidence would resolve it: Extending the search space $\Lambda$ to include layer depth and width, and verifying if OptiINR maintains its convergence efficiency and performance improvements.

## Limitations

- Computational cost scaling for 3D tasks with 512³ resolution is not demonstrated; exact GP inference may become prohibitive
- Generalization across architectures (beyond 4-layer MLPs) is assumed but untested
- Kernel hyperparameter tuning for the product kernel is not specified; poor choices could severely degrade GP performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Global optimization formulation and product kernel construction (supported by theoretical proofs)
- **Medium confidence**: Performance improvements over baselines (reported but dependent on specific implementation choices)
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims for high-resolution 3D tasks (no runtime analysis provided)

## Next Checks

1. **Kernel Ablation Study**: Compare OptiINR performance using product kernel versus treating all variables as continuous (one-hot encoding without ARD) to quantify the benefit of explicit categorical modeling
2. **Cost Scaling Analysis**: Profile exact GP inference time and memory usage across increasing numbers of observations and resolution levels to identify the practical limits of Matheron's rule
3. **Architecture Transfer Test**: Apply OptiINR to a ResNet-based INR architecture to assess whether the learned activation configurations transfer beyond simple MLPs
