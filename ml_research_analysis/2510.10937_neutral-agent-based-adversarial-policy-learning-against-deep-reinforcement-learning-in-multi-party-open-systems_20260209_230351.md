# Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.10937
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves 96% to 87% reduction in winning rates for victim agents in Starcraft II and autonomous driving simulations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to adversarial attacks against deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in multi-party open systems. The method employs a neutral agent that operates without direct interaction with victim agents or full environmental control. By designing adversarial rewards based on failure paths and using LSTM-based estimation under partial observability, the approach successfully reduces victim agent performance by 96% to 87% across different scenarios. The framework demonstrates effectiveness in both competitive (Starcraft II) and collaborative (autonomous driving) settings.

## Method Summary
The approach introduces a neutral adversarial agent that learns to attack DRL agents without requiring direct interactions or full environmental control. The method uses failure path analysis to design adversarial rewards, enabling the neutral agent to exploit vulnerabilities in victim policies. An estimation-based LSTM model calculates rewards under partial observability conditions, allowing the adversarial agent to function effectively even with limited environmental information. The framework is evaluated in both competitive (Starcraft II) and collaborative (autonomous driving) multi-agent environments, demonstrating broad applicability across different DRL application domains.

## Key Results
- Achieves 96% to 87% reduction in winning rates for victim agents across Starcraft II and autonomous driving tasks
- Outperforms traditional reward models in both effectiveness and efficiency metrics
- Demonstrates effectiveness against existing countermeasures in multi-party open systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the neutral agent's ability to operate independently of victim agents while still influencing their performance. The failure path-based reward design allows the adversarial agent to identify and exploit specific vulnerabilities in victim policies without needing to understand the complete decision-making process. The LSTM estimation model compensates for partial observability by learning temporal patterns in the available information, enabling effective reward calculation even with limited environmental data. This combination of independent operation, targeted reward design, and robust estimation under uncertainty creates a powerful adversarial framework.

## Foundational Learning

**Deep Reinforcement Learning**: AI agents learn optimal behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, receiving rewards for desired actions. Why needed: Understanding victim agent learning mechanisms is crucial for designing effective adversarial attacks. Quick check: Verify victim agents use standard DRL algorithms (DQN, PPO, etc.) and understand their reward structures.

**Multi-agent Systems**: Environments with multiple interacting agents, each pursuing their own objectives. Why needed: The paper specifically targets multi-party open systems where multiple agents operate simultaneously. Quick check: Confirm the system dynamics and interaction patterns between multiple agents in the target environment.

**Partial Observability**: Agents operate with incomplete information about the environment state. Why needed: The adversarial agent must function effectively under limited visibility conditions. Quick check: Measure the information gap between what the adversarial agent can observe versus the complete environmental state.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment -> Victim DRL Agent -> Neutral Adversarial Agent (with LSTM Estimator) -> Adversarial Rewards -> Modified Victim Behavior

**Critical Path**: The neutral agent observes partial environmental states → LSTM estimator processes temporal information → Adversarial rewards are calculated based on failure paths → Adversarial policy updates → Victim agent performance degrades

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades direct control over victim agents for operational independence, allowing attacks without requiring full environmental knowledge or direct interactions. This increases stealth but may reduce attack precision compared to white-box approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: Attack effectiveness is measured through reduction in victim winning rates (96-87%), but the paper lacks analysis of potential detection mechanisms or adversarial response patterns.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline attack without LSTM estimation under full observability to measure the contribution of partial observability handling
2. Attack effectiveness comparison between competitive (Starcraft II) and collaborative (autonomous driving) scenarios
3. Ablation study removing failure path reward design to quantify its specific contribution to attack success

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Partial observability assumption relies on LSTM estimation without clear validation of estimation accuracy under varying uncertainty levels
- Lacks comparison with state-of-the-art adversarial DRL methods beyond traditional reward models
- Security analysis is incomplete with limited information on countermeasure specifics and adaptive attack scenarios

## Confidence

**Effectiveness claims (96% to 87% reduction rates)**: Medium - Strong empirical results but limited to specific test environments

**Efficiency improvements over traditional models**: Low - No detailed computational complexity analysis or runtime comparisons

**Countermeasure robustness**: Low - Limited information on countermeasure specifics and adaptive attack scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Validate the LSTM estimation accuracy under varying levels of partial observability by systematically reducing information available to the adversarial agent and measuring performance degradation
2. Test the approach against state-of-the-art adversarial DRL methods (e.g., gradient-based attacks, imitation learning attacks) on the same benchmark tasks for comprehensive performance comparison
3. Conduct ablation studies removing key components (neutral agent assumption, LSTM estimation, failure path reward design) to quantify individual contributions to overall effectiveness
