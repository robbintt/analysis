# Tighter CMI-Based Generalization Bounds via Stochastic Projection and Quantization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23485
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses limitations of conditional mutual information (CMI)-based generalization bounds in statistical learning, particularly cases where such bounds fail to provide meaningful guarantees.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental limitations in conditional mutual information (CMI)-based generalization bounds that fail to provide meaningful guarantees in certain learning scenarios. The authors introduce a novel framework that combines stochastic projection and quantization within the CMI setting to derive tighter bounds. By projecting high-dimensional models onto lower-dimensional subspaces using random matrices and then applying controlled noise through quantization, the method achieves non-vacuous generalization bounds even in previously problematic cases. The approach is particularly effective for Stochastic Convex Optimization problems where standard CMI bounds fail, providing generalization guarantees that scale as O(1/√n) with training set size.

## Method Summary
The core innovation involves introducing a "disintegrated" conditional mutual information framework that explicitly accounts for dimensionality reduction and information compression steps. The method first applies random linear projections to reduce the effective dimensionality of the hypothesis space, then introduces quantization (controlled noise) to limit information leakage about the training data. This two-step process enables tighter information-theoretic bounds by breaking the direct dependence between the full parameter space and the training data. The framework is formalized through a modified CMI that conditions on both the original data and the auxiliary randomness introduced by projection and quantization, allowing for more precise control over the information flow from data to parameters.

## Key Results
- For Stochastic Convex Optimization problems previously identified as counter-examples to standard CMI bounds, the new bounds yield meaningful generalization guarantees of order O(1/√n), decaying with training set size n.
- The method resolves memorization issues in learning algorithms by constructing auxiliary algorithms that achieve comparable generalization without memorizing training data.
- The framework extends to broader classes of generalized linear stochastic optimization problems beyond SCO.
- Application to subspace training algorithms (SGD/SGLD with projection) provides tighter bounds that remain non-vacuous even for deterministic updates.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by strategically limiting the information capacity available to store training-specific patterns. Stochastic projection reduces the effective dimensionality, preventing the algorithm from encoding fine-grained details about individual training examples. Quantization then adds controlled noise that further disrupts the ability to memorize specific data points while preserving the essential structure needed for generalization. This two-stage information bottleneck ensures that any algorithm achieving good training performance must do so by learning generalizable patterns rather than overfitting to training data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conditional Mutual Information (CMI)**: Measures the information shared between a learning algorithm's output and test data, conditioned on training data. Why needed: Serves as the fundamental information-theoretic quantity for deriving generalization bounds. Quick check: Verify that CMI captures the relevant dependencies in your learning setup.
- **Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO)**: A learning framework where the goal is to minimize expected loss over convex parameter sets. Why needed: Provides the canonical setting where standard CMI bounds fail. Quick check: Confirm convexity of your loss function and parameter constraints.
- **Random Projections**: Linear transformations that reduce dimensionality while approximately preserving distances. Why needed: Enables dimensionality reduction without requiring problem-specific structure. Quick check: Verify that the Johnson-Lindenstrauss property holds for your projection dimension.
- **Quantization/Noise Injection**: Adding controlled random perturbations to parameters. Why needed: Provides the mechanism for limiting information capacity. Quick check: Ensure noise levels are calibrated to balance information control with learning capability.
- **Disintegrated CMI**: Modified information measure that accounts for auxiliary randomness from projection and quantization. Why needed: Allows tighter bounds by properly conditioning on all sources of randomness. Quick check: Verify that all random variables are properly accounted for in the information measure.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Random Projection -> Quantization -> Modified CMI Computation -> Generalization Bound

**Critical Path:**
1. Generate random projection matrix
2. Project model parameters through random matrix
3. Apply quantization to projected parameters
4. Compute disintegrated CMI with all randomness accounted for
5. Derive generalization bound from CMI

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Projection dimension vs. bound tightness: Higher dimensions preserve more information but yield looser bounds
- Quantization level vs. algorithm performance: More aggressive quantization improves bounds but may harm optimization
- Computational overhead vs. theoretical guarantees: Additional projection/quantization steps add cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Vacuous bounds despite projection/quantization indicate insufficient information control
- Degraded optimization performance suggests quantization is too aggressive
- Bound improvements without generalization gains suggest theoretical looseness

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply method to a simple SCO problem where standard CMI bounds are known to fail
2. Compare generalization performance and bounds for SGD with and without projection/quantization
3. Vary projection dimension and quantization level to study the tradeoff between bound tightness and optimization performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation demonstrating that theoretical bounds predict actual generalization performance in practice
- Computational overhead introduced by projection and quantization steps may impact practical utility
- Effectiveness of the approach in diverse real-world settings beyond the theoretical assumptions remains to be established

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework for disintegrated CMI and the mathematical proofs of tighter bounds for SCO problems are well-established and rigorous.
- **Medium Confidence**: The extension to generalized linear stochastic optimization problems is sound but relies on assumptions that may not hold in all practical scenarios.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about resolving memorization issues and the practical effectiveness of the bounds in real-world applications require empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies comparing the predicted generalization bounds with actual test error on benchmark datasets for various learning algorithms (including those with projection/quantization).
2. Evaluate the computational overhead of the stochastic projection and quantization steps and analyze the trade-off between bound tightness and computational cost.
3. Test the robustness of the bounds under different data distributions and noise levels to assess their generalizability beyond the theoretical assumptions.
