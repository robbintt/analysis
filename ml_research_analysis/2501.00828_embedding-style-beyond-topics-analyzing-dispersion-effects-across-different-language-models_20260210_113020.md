# Embedding Style Beyond Topics: Analyzing Dispersion Effects Across Different Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.00828
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00828
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: Topic variation increases embedding dispersion more than style variation across 12 language models

## Executive Summary
This study systematically analyzes how writing style affects embedding dispersion across multiple language models. The authors created a controlled literary corpus by alternating between topics and styles using Raymond Queneau's "Exercices de Style" and Félix Fénéon's "Nouvelles en trois lignes," then generating additional texts with GPT-4o. Through k-means clustering and UMAP dimensionality reduction, they found that both topic and style variations significantly influence embedding dispersion, with topic having a stronger effect. The analysis revealed that specific stylistic features like readability indexes, function words, and punctuation partially explain these dispersion patterns. This work contributes to understanding how language models process stylistic information, with implications for model interpretability and future research on text embeddings across different genres and languages.

## Method Summary
The study used the QUENEAU-FENEON corpus with 584 texts total (292 per language), divided into four classes: QUENEAU_REF (73 texts, same topic/varied styles), FENEON_REF (73 texts, varied topics/same style), plus GPT-4o generated QUENEAU_GEN and FENEON_GEN. Twelve embedding models were tested (OpenAI, Mistral, Voyage, RoBERTa variants, E5, DistilBERT). Analysis included k-means clustering with 2D PCA for validation, UMAP dimensionality reduction (30 iterations) for dispersion quantification, and correlation of dispersion with eight stylistic feature groups using Terreau et al.'s framework.

## Key Results
- Topic variation increases embedding dispersion more than style variation across all tested models
- Specific stylistic features (readability indexes, function words, punctuation) partially explain dispersion patterns
- Translation from French to English reduced stylistic signals, weakening style detection in embeddings
- Three models (mistral-embed, voyage-2, solon-embeddings-large-0.1) failed to validate the style hypothesis in the expected direction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topic variation increases embedding dispersion more than style variation
- Mechanism: When semantic content varies across texts, embedding models spread vectors further apart in the embedding space compared to when only surface stylistic features vary while content remains constant
- Core assumption: Embedding models encode semantic content as the primary signal, with stylistic features as secondary modulations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "both topic and style variations significantly influence embedding dispersion, with topic having a stronger effect"
  - [section 4.2] "validation of (T-S) reveals a stronger effect of topic on this dispersion compared to style"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—no corpus papers directly compare topic vs. style dispersion effects

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Style variation independently contributes to embedding dispersion even when topic is held constant
- Mechanism: Stylistic features—readability indexes, function word frequencies, punctuation patterns—create measurable separations in embedding space across different writing styles of the same content
- Core assumption: Models encode some stylistic information in their embeddings rather than normalizing it away
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "specific stylistic features like readability indexes, function words, and punctuation partially explain these dispersion patterns"
  - [section 4.3] "moderate positive correlation in French between dispersion and differences in frequencies for indexes (r = 0.36**), and weak negative correlation with function words (r = −0.28**)"
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration; related work on representation dispersion exists but doesn't isolate style

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-lingual transfer (translation) can attenuate stylistic signals in embeddings
- Mechanism: Translation reduces certain stylistic markers (function words, punctuation density) in ways that diminish the signal-to-noise ratio for style detection, while not equivalently amplifying compensating features
- Core assumption: The English corpus (translated from French) carries weaker stylistic fingerprints than the French originals
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "translation from French to English has notably reduced the presence of function words, letters, and punctuation"
  - [section 4.3] "models generally responded more to stylistic variation in French compared to English"
  - [corpus] No external validation of translation-induced style attenuation

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Embedding dispersion (intra-class variance)**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core metric—measuring how spread out embeddings are from their centroid—quantifies topic/style influence. Without understanding dispersion as "semantic spread," the findings are unintelligible
  - Quick check question: If all texts about "cooking" cluster tightly while texts about "sports" spread widely, which topic has higher dispersion?

- Concept: **UMAP vs. PCA dimensionality reduction**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses PCA for clustering validation and UMAP for dispersion analysis, citing UMAP's superior local+global structure preservation. Understanding why this distinction matters is critical for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: Why would t-SNE be unsuitable for analyzing how spread out different document classes are from each other?

- Concept: **Stylometric features (function words, readability indexes)**
  - Why needed here: The paper correlates dispersion with eight feature categories. Understanding that function words (the, of, and) are style markers—not content markers—clarifies why their correlation with dispersion matters
  - Quick check question: Would you expect legal documents and poetry to differ more in function word frequency or in named entity frequency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: QUENEAU_REF + FENEON_REF → GPT-4o generated variants → 584 total documents (FR/EN) -> 12 embedding models (768-1536 dimensional vectors) -> PCA (clustering validation) -> UMAP (dispersion quantification) -> Correlation with stylometric features

- Critical path:
  1. Build the four-class corpus (QUENEAU_REF, QUENEAU_GEN, FENEON_REF, FENEON_GEN)
  2. Generate embeddings with each model
  3. Validate corpus via k-means clustering (k=4) with 2D PCA—confirm classes separate
  4. Run UMAP (30 iterations, varying seeds) → compute mean centroid distances per class
  5. Test hypotheses (T), (S), (T-S) via pairwise t-tests
  6. Extract stylometric features → correlate feature deltas with dispersion deltas

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **2D UMAP chosen over higher dimensions**: Best hypothesis validation, but loses information; results consistent at 5D/10D but weaker
  - **Small corpus (73 texts/class)**: Enables controlled experiment but limits statistical power; authors acknowledge replication needed
  - **GPT-4o for corpus generation**: Introduces model-dependent stylistic biases; unavoidable for creating controlled style-topic swaps

- Failure signatures:
  - **all-roberta-large-v1**: Failed French topic hypothesis (T)—opposite direction observed
  - **mistral-embed, voyage-2, solon-embeddings-large-0.1**: Failed French style hypothesis (S')—dispersion decreased instead of increased with style variation
  - **English corpus broadly**: Weaker hypothesis validation, especially for style; translation attenuation suspected

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Replicate with expanded corpus**: Increase to 200+ texts per class; test whether hypothesis validation rates stabilize or shift
  2. **Ablate stylistic features**: Remove function words from all texts; re-run dispersion analysis to isolate causal contribution
  3. **Cross-model consistency check**: For models that failed (S'), examine whether their attention patterns differ from successful models on the same style-varying text pairs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the observed effects of style on embedding dispersion generalize to non-literary genres, such as journalism or scientific writing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state, "Concerning genres, we aim to apply our methodology to news articles," noting that other areas like scientific writing are unexplored
- Why unresolved: The study relies exclusively on the literary QUENEAU-FENEON corpus, which follows different stylistic conventions than news or academic texts
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same clustering and dispersion analysis to a large-scale corpus of news articles or scientific abstracts

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does writing style influence embedding dispersion in languages that are typologically more diverse than French and English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors hope to "inspire further stylistic studies on languages that are more typologically diverse than French and English"
- Why unresolved: The current analysis is limited to two related Indo-European languages, leaving the impact of distinct linguistic structures on embedding spaces unknown
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the experiment on corpora from typologically distinct language families (e.g., agglutinative or tonal languages)

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are the differences in stylistic sensitivity between French and English embeddings caused by translation artifacts or inherent model limitations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest the "reduced sensitivity in English is that translation may have diminished" certain features, listing "translation or language-specific characteristics" as a potential factor
- Why unresolved: The English corpus was translated from French, conflating translation quality with language-specific processing capabilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative analysis using a natively written English corpus rather than a translated one

## Limitations
- Small corpus size (73 texts per class) limits statistical power for pairwise comparisons
- Translation attenuation of stylistic signals remains an untested assumption without direct empirical validation
- GPT-4o generated texts introduce model-dependent stylistic biases that cannot be controlled or quantified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Topic having stronger effect than style on embedding dispersion (consistent across languages and models)
- **Medium confidence**: Specific stylistic features (readability indexes, function words, punctuation) partially explaining dispersion patterns
- **Low confidence**: Translation attenuation hypothesis (lacks direct empirical validation)

## Next Checks
1. **Expand corpus size**: Increase to 200+ texts per class and test whether hypothesis validation rates stabilize or shift, particularly for models that currently fail style hypotheses
2. **Isolate causal stylistic features**: Systematically remove function words from all texts and re-run dispersion analysis to quantify their independent contribution to embedding separation
3. **Cross-model attention analysis**: For models that failed (S'), examine their attention patterns on style-varying text pairs compared to successful models to identify architectural differences in style processing
