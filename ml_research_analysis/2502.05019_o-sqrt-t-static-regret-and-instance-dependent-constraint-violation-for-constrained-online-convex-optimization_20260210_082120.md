# $O(\sqrt{T})$ Static Regret and Instance Dependent Constraint Violation for Constrained Online Convex Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.05019
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05019
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ static regret and instance-dependent cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounded by geometric constant $V$ for constrained online convex optimization.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the constrained online convex optimization (COCO) problem where the learner must minimize regret while satisfying time-varying convex constraints. The authors propose Algorithm 2 that exploits the geometric structure of nested constraint sets through a two-step projection approach. By projecting online gradient descent steps onto the intersection of past constraint sets, the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret while keeping CCV bounded by a quantity $V$ that depends on the geometry of the constraint sets. For well-structured constraint sets like spheres or axis-aligned cuboids, $V = O(1)$, while for general cases, $V$ depends on the specific shape characteristics.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes Algorithm 2 for COCO that computes an intermediate point $y_t$ by projecting an OGD step onto the previous constraint intersection $S_{t-1}$, then projects $y_t$ onto the current intersection $S_t$. The step-size is set as $\eta_t = \frac{D}{G\sqrt{t}}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the admissible set and $G$ is the Lipschitz constant. For switching between algorithms, Algorithm Switch combines Algorithm 2 with a baseline algorithm from prior work, using Algorithm 2 when cumulative violation is low and switching to the baseline when CCV exceeds $\sqrt{T}\log T$. The method exploits the nested structure of constraint sets to achieve better CCV bounds than previous approaches.

## Key Results
- Algorithm 2 achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and CCV bounded by $V$, where $V = O(1)$ for nice constraint sets (spheres, axis-aligned cuboids) and depends on geometry for general cases
- For d=2 with monotonic projection angles, Algorithm 2 achieves $O(1)$ CCV
- Algorithm Switch achieves the best of both worlds: $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\min\{V, O(\sqrt{T}\log T)\}$ CCV
- For the online constraint satisfaction (OCS) problem, Algorithm 2 achieves $O(1)$ CCV

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm exploits the nested structure of constraint sets by projecting onto the intersection of all past constraint sets rather than just the current constraint. This geometric insight allows the algorithm to maintain feasibility across all historical constraints while still achieving optimal regret bounds. The two-step projection approach ensures that each new iterate respects both the previous constraints (through $S_{t-1}$) and the current constraints (through $S_t$), preventing the constraint violation from accumulating linearly over time.

## Foundational Learning

**Convex projection oracle** - Needed for computing $P_{S_t}(x)$ where $S_t = \cap_{\tau=1}^t \{x: g_\tau(x) \le 0\}$. Quick check: Verify that projection onto simple convex sets (spheres, rectangles) can be computed analytically or with standard solvers.

**Nested constraint structure** - Understanding that $S_{t-1} \subseteq S_t$ is crucial for the algorithm's design. Quick check: Confirm that constraint sets shrink or stay the same over time for the problem instances being considered.

**Online gradient descent with projections** - Standard OGD analysis provides the $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret baseline. Quick check: Verify that step-size $\eta_t = \frac{D}{G\sqrt{t}}$ maintains the standard regret guarantees.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Environment -> Algorithm 2 (main loop) -> Projection oracle -> Constraint sets $S_t$ -> Regret and CCV tracking

**Critical path:** Each round requires: play $x_t$ → observe $f_t, g_t$ → compute gradients → update $S_t$ → compute $y_t = P_{S_{t-1}}(x_t - \eta_t \nabla f_t(x_t))$ → compute $x_{t+1} = P_{S_t}(y_t)$ → track Regret and CCV

**Design tradeoffs:** The algorithm trades computational complexity (projecting onto intersections of multiple sets) for better constraint violation bounds. Exact projection oracles may be expensive for complex constraints, potentially requiring approximation methods.

**Failure signatures:** CCV growing as $O(\sqrt{T})$ instead of $O(1)$ on simple instances suggests incorrect projection logic or violation of nested structure assumptions. Early constraint violations indicate step-size issues or incorrect Lipschitz constant usage.

**First experiments:** 1) Implement and validate projection oracle for shrinking spheres to confirm $O(1)$ CCV behavior, 2) Run Algorithm 2 on axis-aligned rectangles to verify theoretical bounds, 3) Test Algorithm Switch to confirm it achieves $\min\{V, O(\sqrt{T}\log T)\}$ CCV across different regimes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on projection oracle for intersection of all past constraint sets, which may be computationally expensive for arbitrary convex constraints
- Analysis assumes exact projections, which may not be practical for complex constraint sets or high-dimensional problems
- Switching mechanism depends on parameters from prior work (Sinha & Vaze 2024), introducing dependencies that may affect reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for Algorithm 2 follows standard OGD analysis with projection
- **Medium Confidence:** CCV bound of $O(1)$ for nice constraint sets and $O(V)$ for general cases depends on geometric properties and projection oracle accuracy
- **Medium Confidence:** Switching algorithm's $\min\{V, O(\sqrt{T}\log T)\}$ CCV guarantee relies on correct implementation of both Algorithm 2 and baseline from Sinha & Vaze 2024

## Next Checks
1. Implement and validate the projection oracle for simple constraint sets (e.g., shrinking spheres) to confirm $O(1)$ CCV behavior on a synthetic 2D instance
2. Test Algorithm 2 on a non-nice constraint set (e.g., irregularly shaped nested sets) to empirically verify that CCV scales with the geometric constant $V$
3. Verify the switching mechanism by running Algorithm 3 and confirming that it achieves the claimed $\min\{V, O(\sqrt{T}\log T)\}$ CCV bound across different regimes (early vs. late switching)
