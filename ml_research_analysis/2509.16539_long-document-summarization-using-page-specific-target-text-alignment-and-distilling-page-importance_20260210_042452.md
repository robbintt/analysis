# Long document summarization using page specific target text alignment and distilling page importance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.16539
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16539
- **Reference count**: 15
- **Primary result**: PTSPI achieves 6.32% ROUGE-1 and 8.08% ROUGE-2 improvement over state-of-the-art on arXiv dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles long-document abstractive summarization by addressing the limitations of transformer models with fixed context windows. The authors propose PTS (Page-specific Target-text alignment Summarization) which segments documents into fixed-length pages and aligns each page with relevant summary sentences, rather than providing the full summary to every page. PTSPI extends this by adding teacher-student distillation to learn dynamic page importance weights. Experiments on the arXiv benchmark show significant improvements in ROUGE scores while maintaining computational efficiency through page-level processing.

## Method Summary
The approach segments long documents into non-overlapping pages of up to 1024 tokens. PTS aligns each page with relevant parts of the target summary using cosine similarity between page and summary sentence embeddings, providing more precise supervision. PTSPI adds a teacher-student distillation layer where a frozen sentence encoder computes similarity between page summaries and the gold summary to produce teacher importance distributions, while a student network learns to predict these weights through KL divergence loss. The final model combines cross-entropy and KL losses, trained on the arXiv dataset with BART-large backbone.

## Key Results
- PTSPI achieves 51.61 ROUGE-1 and 22.21 ROUGE-2 on arXiv test set
- Outperforms state-of-the-art PageSum by 6.32% in ROUGE-1 and 8.08% in ROUGE-2
- Reduces memory complexity from quadratic to linear through page segmentation
- Validation BERTScore used for early stopping

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Page-to-Summary Alignment
Aligning each page with only its relevant target summary sentences improves learning precision by reducing noise in supervision. The model computes cosine similarity between page embeddings and summary sentence embeddings, assigning each summary sentence to the most similar page. During training, each page generates only its assigned sentences rather than the full summary.

### Mechanism 2: Teacher-Student Importance Distillation
Explicit supervision on page importance via teacher-student distillation improves focus on informative pages. A frozen sentence encoder computes similarity between page summaries and gold summary to produce teacher distributions. A student network predicts page weights at each decoding step, with KL divergence aligning predictions with teacher signals.

### Mechanism 3: Linear Memory Complexity
Segmentation into fixed-length pages with independent processing reduces memory from quadratic to linear in document length. Each page is encoded and decoded independently, with partial summaries aggregated via a confidence layer. Space complexity becomes O(N) rather than O(N²).

## Foundational Learning

- **Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention**: Understanding encoder-decoder attention is essential since the paper extends BART, a seq2seq model. Can you explain how the decoder attends to encoder hidden states at each generation step?

- **KL Divergence for Distribution Matching**: PTSPI uses KL divergence to align student-predicted page weights with teacher distribution. If teacher distribution T = [0.7, 0.2, 0.1] and student Z = [0.4, 0.4, 0.2], will KL loss be high or low, and why?

- **Cosine Similarity over Embeddings**: Both alignment and teacher distribution rely on cosine similarity between embeddings. Given two vectors [1, 0] and [0, 1], what is their cosine similarity? What if they were [1, 0] and [1, 0.01]?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Preprocessor -> Aligner -> Encoder-Decoder -> Teacher (PTSPI only) -> Student (PTSPI only) -> Confidence Aggregator -> Loss Combiner

- **Critical path**: Document → page segmentation → page-to-summary-sentence alignment → per-page encoding and decoding → (PTSPI) teacher distribution computation → student prediction → KL loss → aggregation via confidence layer → final summary

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Page size (1024 tokens) balances context capture against memory constraints
  - λ = 0.1 prioritizes generation quality over importance supervision
  - Frozen teacher vs. fine-tuned sentence encoder tradeoff between stability and adaptation
  - One-to-one vs. many-to-many alignment affects precision vs. completeness

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Degenerate alignment: all summary sentences assigned to one page
  - Flat teacher distribution: all T_j ≈ 1/P, providing weak importance signals
  - Incoherent final summary: poor transitions between concatenated partial summaries
  - Memory overflow: very high page counts exceeding aggregation memory

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline reproduction: Reimplement PageSum on arXiv dataset with identical preprocessing
  2. Ablation on alignment: Compare random alignment vs. cosine similarity-based alignment
  3. Ablation on distillation: Train PTSPI with λ ∈ {0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5} to find optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Many-to-many alignments**: How would modeling many-to-many alignments between summary sentences and document pages affect summarization accuracy compared to the current one-to-one mapping?

- **Cross-page dependency modeling**: Can incorporating cross-page dependency modeling into the PTSPI architecture improve summary coherence?

- **Generalization to non-scientific domains**: Does the page-importance distillation mechanism generalize to non-scientific domains with different discourse structures?

## Limitations

- **Alignment quality uncertainty**: Relies on cosine similarity between contextual embeddings without qualitative validation of alignment quality or discussion of failure modes.

- **Teacher distribution validity**: Assumes Sentence-BERT similarity is a reliable proxy for page importance, but doesn't validate whether these distributions are actually meaningful.

- **Limited cross-page context**: Independent page encoding loses cross-page dependencies, which is acknowledged as a significant architectural constraint.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: 6.32% ROUGE-1 and 8.08% ROUGE-2 improvements over PageSum on arXiv benchmark are well-supported by experimental results.

- **Medium confidence**: Dynamic page importance weighting via teacher-student distillation shows plausible improvements, but relies on the validity of teacher distributions.

- **Low confidence**: Claims about alignment precision improving learning lack qualitative validation of alignment quality across the dataset.

## Next Checks

1. **Alignment quality audit**: Sample 50 documents and manually verify alignment quality between pages and summary sentences to identify failure patterns.

2. **Teacher distribution sanity check**: Compute entropy of teacher distributions for 20 documents to verify whether teacher is providing strong importance signals.

3. **Cross-page dependency analysis**: Identify documents where coreference spans page boundaries and quantify performance degradation to measure cost of no-cross-page-attention assumption.
