# Constrained Pareto Set Identification with Bandit Feedback

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2506.08127
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08127
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: e-cAPE algorithm achieves near-optimal sample complexity for identifying constrained Pareto Sets in multi-objective bandits

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces constrained Pareto Set Identification (cPSI), a novel multi-objective bandit problem where the goal is to identify the Pareto Set of arms satisfying linear feasibility constraints. The authors propose e-cAPE, an algorithm using upper and lower confidence bounds to efficiently balance feasibility detection and Pareto Set identification. They prove e-cAPE is near-optimal, with sample complexity scaling as C_M*(ν) log(KC_M*(ν)/δ), where C_M* is a problem-dependent complexity measure. Experiments on real-world datasets (clinical trials) show e-cAPE significantly outperforms baselines including two-stage approaches and racing algorithms, demonstrating superior empirical performance in identifying constrained Pareto Sets.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces e-cAPE (efficient constrained Pareto Set Identification), a bandit algorithm that uses upper and lower confidence bounds to balance feasibility detection with Pareto Set identification. The algorithm employs two parallel sets of confidence bounds: feasibility bounds to check if arms satisfy constraints, and Pareto bounds to determine if arms belong to the optimal Pareto Set. The key insight is that an arm is feasible if its lower feasibility bound exceeds zero, and it belongs to the Pareto Set if its upper Pareto bound is smaller than the lower Pareto bound of all other feasible arms. The algorithm adaptively samples arms based on these confidence bounds, focusing exploration on arms that could potentially be in the constrained Pareto Set while maintaining theoretical guarantees on identification accuracy.

## Key Results
- e-cAPE algorithm achieves sample complexity scaling as C_M*(ν) log(KC_M*(ν)/δ)
- Near-optimal performance with problem-dependent complexity measure C_M*
- Superior empirical performance on clinical trial datasets compared to two-stage approaches and racing algorithms
- Provides PAC guarantee for identifying the constrained Pareto Set with probability at least 1-δ

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by simultaneously tracking feasibility and Pareto optimality through confidence bounds. For feasibility detection, it uses lower confidence bounds on constraint satisfaction - an arm is considered feasible if this bound exceeds zero. For Pareto identification, it uses upper confidence bounds on objective values - an arm belongs to the Pareto Set if its upper bound is smaller than the lower bounds of all other feasible arms. This dual confidence bound approach allows the algorithm to focus sampling on arms that are both potentially feasible and potentially Pareto optimal, while safely eliminating arms that cannot meet both criteria. The adaptive sampling strategy ensures efficient exploration by prioritizing arms that provide the most information about the constrained Pareto Set.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-objective bandits**: Understanding that multiple competing objectives require balancing tradeoffs rather than finding a single optimal arm. Why needed: The problem inherently involves competing objectives. Quick check: Can identify Pareto optimal arms when no constraints exist.

**Confidence bounds in bandits**: Using statistical confidence intervals to make safe decisions about arm quality. Why needed: Enables safe elimination of suboptimal arms. Quick check: Can compute UCB/LCB for mean rewards.

**Feasibility constraints**: Linear constraints that must be satisfied by selected arms. Why needed: Real-world problems often have resource or operational constraints. Quick check: Can verify if arm satisfies given constraints.

**Pareto optimality**: An arm is Pareto optimal if no other arm dominates it across all objectives. Why needed: The goal is to identify the complete set of non-dominated solutions. Quick check: Can determine if one arm Pareto dominates another.

**PAC identification**: Probably Approximately Correct framework for identifying solution sets. Why needed: Provides theoretical guarantees on identification accuracy. Quick check: Can verify if identified set contains true Pareto Set with high probability.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Arm sampling -> Confidence bound updates -> Feasibility check -> Pareto Set update -> Adaptive sampling decision

**Critical path**: Each round: sample arm → observe rewards → update UCB/LCB → check feasibility → update Pareto Set → decide next arm

**Design tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades off between exploration (sampling to reduce uncertainty) and exploitation (focusing on promising arms). The dual confidence bound approach adds complexity but enables more efficient identification by simultaneously checking feasibility and Pareto optimality.

**Failure signatures**: High sample complexity when constraint boundaries are ambiguous, poor performance when objective values are highly correlated, failure to identify true Pareto Set when confidence bounds are too loose.

**First 3 experiments**:
1. Verify confidence bound computation for both feasibility and objective values
2. Test feasibility detection on simple linear constraints with known solutions
3. Validate Pareto Set identification on unconstrained multi-objective problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions including extending the framework to handle more general constraint structures, exploring alternative confidence bound constructions for improved empirical performance, and investigating the impact of correlation between objectives on sample complexity. Additionally, the authors suggest that extending the approach to handle dynamic or time-varying constraints could be an interesting direction for future work.

## Limitations
- Sample complexity depends on problem-dependent constant C_M* which can be large in some instances
- Assumes linear feasibility constraints which may not capture all real-world constraint structures
- Performance degrades when constraint boundaries are ambiguous or when objective values are highly correlated
- Current analysis focuses on fixed confidence setting, extension to fixed budget setting remains open
