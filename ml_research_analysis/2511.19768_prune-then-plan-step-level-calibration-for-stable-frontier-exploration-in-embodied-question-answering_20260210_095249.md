- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19768

## Executive Summary
This work addresses unstable frontier exploration in embodied question answering (EQA), where large vision-language models (VLMs) can exhibit oscillatory behavior due to miscalibration. The proposed Prune-Then-Plan method stabilizes exploration by separating frontier pruning from planning. First, it uses VLMs to reject implausible frontiers based on calibrated confidence, then applies a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning rule over frontier hypotheses, and finally selects the next frontier via a coverage-based planner. This converts overconfident VLM decisions into conservative, interpretable actions. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, the method improves visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics by up to 49% and 33% respectively over baselines on OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets, while also improving scene coverage under equal exploration budgets.

## Method Summary
Prune-Then-Plan is a frontier exploration method that stabilizes VLM-based decision making by separating semantic rejection from action selection. The method first generates frontier snapshots from a 3D-Mem world representation, then uses a VLM to score each frontier's relevance to the question. These scores are step-normalized and mapped to p-values using an ECDF calibrated on human-labeled "bad" frontiers. A Holm-Bonferroni inspired step-down procedure with hyperparameter α prunes implausible frontiers, and a coverage-based planner selects the closest surviving frontier via geodesic distance. This approach converts VLM overconfidence into conservative exploration while maintaining interpretability.

## Key Results
- Improves visually grounded SPL by up to 49% and LLM-Match by up to 33% over baselines on OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets
- Demonstrates superior stability with reduced oscillatory behavior compared to direct VLM planning
- Shows effective transfer of calibration from OpenEQA to EXPRESS-Bench despite different datasets
- Achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic-Rejection Separation Prevents Oscillatory Drift
Decoupling VLM-based semantic filtering from final action selection reduces frontier oscillations caused by VLM miscalibration. The VLM assigns confidence scores to frontier snapshots, but these scores are used only to reject implausible options rather than select the best one. A coverage-based planner then chooses the closest surviving frontier, introducing a stable, distance-aware decision rule that is insensitive to step-to-step VLM confidence fluctuations. Core assumption: VLMs are better at recognizing clearly irrelevant frontiers than at ranking semantically plausible ones. Break condition: If all frontiers are semantically plausible, pruning provides no signal and the planner defaults to closest-frontier behavior.

### Mechanism 2: ECDF-Based p-value Mapping Calibrates VLM Confidence to Human Judgment
Mapping step-normalized VLM confidence scores to p-values via an empirical CDF fitted on human-labeled "bad" frontiers provides a calibrated rejection signal. At each step, VLM confidences are normalized by the maximum confidence in that step. These relative scores are compared against an ECDF built from ~5,500 human-labeled bad frontiers. Scores typical of bad frontiers yield high p-values (candidates for pruning); unusually high scores yield low p-values (retained). Core assumption: The distribution of bad-frontier scores is stable across scenes and question types within the same dataset family. Break condition: If the calibration set is small, noisy, or distributionally mismatched, the ECDF may mischaracterize bad-frontier scores, leading to under- or over-pruning.

### Mechanism 3: Holm-Bonferroni Step-Down Rule Provides Tunable Pruning Aggressiveness
Adapting the Holm-Bonferroni multiple hypothesis testing procedure as a rejection rule allows interpretable control over frontier pruning via a single hyperparameter α. Each frontier is treated as a null hypothesis "this frontier is bad." The step-down procedure tests frontiers in order of increasing p-value, rejecting hypotheses until the p-value exceeds α/(K−j+1). The surviving frontiers form the accepted set. Smaller α → aggressive pruning; larger α → more frontiers retained. Core assumption: α functions as a behavioral parameter rather than a formal error-control level. Break condition: If the number of frontiers K_t is very small, the correction has little effect and the procedure collapses to thresholding on p-values directly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Frontier-based exploration**: Frontiers are boundaries between explored and unexplored regions; selecting which frontier to pursue determines exploration efficiency.
  - Why needed here: The entire method operates on frontier sets; without this concept, the pruning/planning distinction is meaningless.
  - Quick check question: Given an occupancy grid, can you identify the frontier cells at the edge of known free space?

- **VLM overconfidence and miscalibration**: VLMs often produce high confidence for incorrect predictions; token-level probabilities are more reliable than self-reported scores.
  - Why needed here: The method explicitly addresses VLM miscalibration; understanding why calibration is needed motivates the ECDF approach.
  - Quick check question: Why might a VLM assign 95% confidence to an incorrect frontier choice?

- **Multiple hypothesis testing correction**: When testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, naive thresholding inflates false positives; methods like Holm-Bonferroni control family-wise error rate.
  - Why needed here: The pruning rule is a direct adaptation of Holm-Bonferroni; understanding the ordering and thresholding logic is essential.
  - Quick check question: In Holm-Bonferroni, why does the threshold α/(K−j+1) increase as j increases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Frontier generation -> VLM scoring -> Step normalization -> ECDF calibrator -> Holm-Bonferroni pruner -> Coverage planner

- **Critical path**: Frontier generation → VLM scoring → step normalization → p-value mapping → HB pruning → closest-frontier selection. The calibration ECDF is precomputed offline; all other components run per-step.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - α value: Lower α → more aggressive pruning → risk of eliminating good frontiers; higher α → more conservative → risk of retaining bad frontiers. Tuned to 0.5 on EXPRESS-Bench subset.
  - Annotation effort: ~5,500 human labels required; ablations show robustness to 5–10% label noise.
  - Question-type specificity: Current ECDF is global; per-category ECDFs could improve but require more calibration data.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Early pruning collapse: If α is too low and all frontiers are pruned, fallback behavior is undefined (paper does not specify).
  - ECDF mismatch: If calibration scenes differ structurally from test scenes, p-values may be uninformative.
  - Short-horizon tasks: On EXPRESS-Bench, gains over 3D-Mem are smaller; method may be overkill for easy questions.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce ECDF construction: Label a small calibration set (e.g., 500 frontiers), fit ECDF, and visualize score distributions for "good" vs. "bad" frontiers to confirm separability.
  2. Ablate α on validation set: Sweep α ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9} and plot SPL, LLM-Match, and curvature to verify the 0.5 optimum and understand sensitivity.
  3. Visualize pruning behavior: On a single episode, log per-step frontier scores, p-values, pruning decisions, and planner choices; confirm that pruned frontiers are semantically irrelevant and that the planner avoids oscillations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would category-specific ECDF calibration (e.g., separate distributions for "location" vs. "object" questions) yield significant performance gains over the current single-distribution approach?
- Basis in paper: Section 4.3 notes that "location questions are particularly sensitive, peaking around α = 0.6" and explicitly states that "this sensitivity suggests that using category-specific distributions for p-value mapping could further improve performance on certain question types."
- Why unresolved: The authors use a single pooled ECDF across all question types for simplicity, leaving category-specific calibration unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation experiments comparing per-category ECDFs against the pooled ECDF, reporting LLM-Match/EAC scores stratified by question category on EXPRESS-Bench.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is Prune-Then-Plan when transferring to significantly different environments (e.g., outdoor scenes, industrial settings) without recalibrating the bad-frontier ECDF?
- Basis in paper: The ECDF is calibrated only on OpenEQA (HM3D indoor residential scenes) and tested on EXPRESS-Bench (same domain). The paper claims transferability but provides no evidence beyond these similar indoor settings.
- Why unresolved: The bad-frontier score distribution may be environment-specific; distribution shift could degrade p-value mapping reliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on out-of-domain EQA benchmarks (e.g., outdoor or office environments) using the same HM3D-calibrated ECDF, with analysis of calibration drift.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can α be adaptively adjusted per-step or per-question-category rather than fixed at 0.5, and would this improve exploration efficiency?
- Basis in paper: Figure 5 shows clear category-specific sensitivity to α, with optimal values differing by question type. The paper treats α as a static behavioral hyperparameter.
- Why unresolved: Dynamic α selection could capture category-specific exploration needs but introduces additional complexity and may require online estimation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of adaptive α schemes (e.g., question-classifier-gated or uncertainty-driven adjustment) with comparison to fixed-α baselines on SPL and coverage AUC.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does Prune-Then-Plan perform when the VLM exhibits systematic biases (e.g., consistent overconfidence in certain visual contexts like dimly lit regions)?
- Basis in paper: The method assumes the ECDF captures the typical bad-frontier score distribution, but systematic VLM biases could shift this distribution at test time in ways the calibration set does not reflect.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates aggregate performance but does not analyze failure modes tied to VLM systematic miscalibration in specific visual conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Stratified analysis of frontier pruning accuracy across visual conditions (lighting, clutter, occlusion) with correlation to VLM confidence calibration curves per condition.

## Limitations
- Dataset and Task Generalization: Reliance on fixed ECDF trained on OpenEQA bad frontiers introduces potential brittleness when applied to significantly different environments
- Hyperparameter Sensitivity: α is treated as behavioral parameter without formal calibration, with unclear generalization across environment complexities
- Computational Overhead: Additional processing stages (VLM scoring, normalization, ECDF mapping, HB pruning) could impact real-time deployment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core claim that separating semantic rejection from final action selection reduces oscillatory behavior is well-supported by experimental results showing 49% SPL improvement on OpenEQA
- **Medium Confidence**: The calibration approach using ECDF mapping from human-labeled bad frontiers is methodologically sound but relies on untested assumptions about score distribution stability
- **Low Confidence**: The statistical framing using Holm-Bonferroni correction may be more elaborate than necessary, with the paper acknowledging treating α as behavioral rather than statistical

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution Stability Test**: Generate ECDFs from multiple independent calibration sets across different environment types. Measure the divergence between these distributions and the original ECDF to quantify the risk of miscalibration when applying to new environments.

2. **Ablation of Statistical Framework**: Replace the Holm-Bonferroni pruning rule with simple thresholding at various confidence levels. Compare performance to determine whether the statistical framing provides meaningful benefits beyond simpler approaches.

3. **Real-Time Performance Profiling**: Measure the computational overhead of each processing stage (VLM scoring, normalization, ECDF mapping, pruning) on target deployment hardware. Determine whether the accuracy gains justify the additional latency, particularly for applications requiring sub-second response times.
