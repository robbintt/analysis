# Parallel-R1: Towards Parallel Thinking via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07980

- Introduces first RL framework for parallel thinking in LLMs, achieving 8.4% accuracy improvement over sequential baselines on challenging math benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Parallel-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to instill parallel thinking capabilities in large language models for complex mathematical reasoning tasks. The authors propose a progressive curriculum that first teaches the format of parallel thinking on simpler problems via supervised fine-tuning, then transitions to reinforcement learning to generalize this skill to harder problems. The framework addresses the cold-start problem by generating high-quality parallel thinking data on easy math tasks and employs an alternating reward strategy to balance accuracy and parallel reasoning behavior. Experiments on MATH, AMC23, and AIME benchmarks show that Parallel-R1 achieves an 8.4% accuracy improvement over sequential thinking models trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Notably, the analysis reveals a strategic evolution in the model's thinking behavior, shifting from early-stage computational exploration to late-stage multi-perspective verification, and demonstrates that parallel thinking can serve as a mid-training exploration scaffold, yielding a 42.9% improvement over baseline on AIME25. The code and data will be open-sourced.

## Method Summary
Parallel-R1 employs a three-stage curriculum on Qwen-3-4B-Base using VERL codebase with GRPO. First, cold-start SFT on Parallel-GSM8K (7,473 samples, 83.7% valid format) teaches tag structure via prompting and format filtering. Second, optional stage-1 RL on GSM8K stabilizes format for causal variants. Third, large-scale RL on DAPO with accuracy-only or alternating rewards. The causal variant uses standard transformers with sequentialized parallel paths, while the structured variant employs path-window attention masks and multiverse position encodings for path isolation. Alternating rewards (80% accuracy-only, 20% tiered parallel+accuracy) maintain both parallel usage (63.0%) and high benchmark scores.

## Key Results
- 8.4% accuracy improvement over sequential thinking models trained directly on challenging tasks with RL
- Parallel thinking as mid-training exploration scaffold yields 42.9% improvement over baseline on AIME25
- Alternating reward strategy achieves best balance: 63.0% parallel ratio with highest or near-highest accuracy on all benchmarks
- Causal variant outperforms structured variant (48.9 vs lower avg scores), suggesting computational overhead outweighs isolation benefits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A progressive curriculum bypasses the cold-start problem in RL-based parallel thinking.
- Mechanism: SFT on simple problems (GSM8K) teaches the model the parallel thinking *format* using easily-prompted data. RL on harder problems (DAPO) then generalizes this *ability* through exploration, avoiding the need for costly synthetic data pipelines on challenging tasks.
- Core assumption: The format learned on simple tasks transfers to complex tasks; the model can discover new reasoning patterns via RL that SFT alone would not produce.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL." [section 3.3, Table 1] "A powerful model can produce valid parallel-thinking traces for 83.6% of simple GSM8K problems, but fails to generate a single valid trace for the more challenging DAPO problems (0.0% success rate)."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Alternating accuracy and parallel-rewards balances reasoning quality with structural exploration.
- Mechanism: Rewarding only accuracy suppresses parallel thinking (13.6% parallel ratio). Rewarding only parallel structure degrades performance (AMC23 drops to 59.4). Alternating—80% accuracy-only steps, 20% tiered parallel+accuracy rewards—maintains both parallel usage (63.0%) and high benchmark scores.
- Core assumption: The model does not overfit to the periodic reward switch; the 10-step window is sufficient to reinforce both behaviors without interference.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.5.2, Table 4] Shows parallel ratio of 13.6 (accuracy-only), 80.3 (parallel-only), and 63.0 (alternating), with alternating achieving best or near-best on AIME25/AMC23.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parallel thinking serves as a mid-training exploration scaffold, not just an inference strategy.
- Mechanism: A two-phase curriculum forces high parallel-ratio exploration early (alternating rewards), then switches to accuracy-only exploitation. Performance peaks *after* the exploration phase ends and parallel usage declines—suggesting the scaffold guided policy to a better region of solution space.
- Core assumption: The exploration phase discovers reasoning paths that accuracy-only training would not reach; these paths persist even after parallel incentives are removed.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.5, Figure 4] "Stage-1 (Exploration Phase)... forces the model to explore... Stage-2 (Exploitation Phase)... reaches a peak AIME25 accuracy of 25.6%... improvement over the Baseline GRPO model."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cold-start problem in RL**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core motivation—without initial parallel thinking demonstrations, the model cannot generate trajectories for RL to learn from.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why providing even low-quality demonstrations can bootstrap RL, and why this is distinct from imitation learning?

- Concept: **Curriculum learning**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on a staged progression (easy→hard, format→ability) rather than end-to-end training.
  - Quick check question: What failure modes occur when training directly on hard tasks without a warmup phase?

- Concept: **Reward shaping for structured generation**
  - Why needed here: The alternating reward scheme explicitly trades off multiple objectives (accuracy vs. structural format).
  - Quick check question: How would you detect if a multi-objective reward is causing the model to "game" one metric at the expense of another?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Parallel-GSM8K generation -> Cold-start SFT -> Stage-1 RL (optional) -> Stage-2 RL on DAPO -> Parallel-R1 variants
  - Causal variant: Standard transformer with sequentialized parallel paths
  - Structured variant: Path-window attention mask + multiverse position encodings

- Critical path:
  1. Construct Parallel-GSM8K (SFT cold-start data) via prompting + format filtering (Algorithm 1)
  2. Run SFT on Parallel-GSM8K to teach tag structure
  3. Optionally run small-scale RL on GSM8K (for causal variant only) to stabilize format
  4. Run large-scale RL on DAPO with GRPO, using accuracy-only or alternating rewards

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Causal vs. Structured: Causal (Seen) achieves higher avg. score (48.9) but allows cross-path leakage; Structured (Unseen) enforces isolation but underperforms and requires different reward schedule
  - Stage 1 RL: Helps causal variant (+2.3% avg), hurts structured variant (-8.6% avg)—attention masks learned on easy tasks may not transfer
  - Prompt presence: Removing parallel-thinking prompt reduces performance (-1.8% avg), indicating prompt helps guide behavior, not just format

- Failure signatures:
  - Low parallel ratio (<20%): Accuracy-only reward dominates; model reverts to sequential reasoning
  - High parallel ratio (>80%) but low accuracy: Over-optimization of structure reward; model generates spurious paths
  - Structured variant collapse after Stage 1 RL: Mask overfits to easy-task distribution; degrades on hard tasks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate Table 1: Prompt a strong model on GSM8K vs. DAPO; confirm format success rate gap (>80% vs. ~0%)
  2. Ablate Stage 1 RL: Train causal variant with and without GSM8K RL; expect +2-3% avg difference (Table 3)
  3. Test reward schedules: Compare accuracy-only, parallel-only, and alternating on Parallel-R1-Unseen; expect alternating to achieve 50-70% parallel ratio with best-or-near-best accuracy (Table 4)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal reward design for stimulating parallel thinking without compromising task performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "the best reward function for RL remains unclear" and note that accuracy-only rewards fail to stimulate parallel thinking (13.6% parallel ratio), while direct parallel rewards hurt performance (AMC23 drops from 69.7 to 59.4).
- Why unresolved: The alternating reward strategy is a heuristic improvement, not a theoretically grounded solution; the trade-off between parallel usage and accuracy remains uncharacterized.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying reward schedules, or a theoretical framework predicting optimal reward balancing given model capability and task difficulty.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Why do structured attention variants underperform compared to causal models when using the same curriculum?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper finds adding stage-1 RL on GSM8K severely hurts structured variant performance (-8.6% average) while helping causal models (+2.3%), hypothesizing poor generalization of attention masks across difficulty distributions.
- Why unresolved: The hypothesis about distribution shift in attention patterns is stated but not empirically validated through targeted ablations or attention visualization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of attention pattern transfer from GSM8K to DAPO, or experiments with curriculum variations designed for structural variants.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does parallel thinking as a mid-training exploration scaffold generalize to non-mathematical reasoning domains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] All experiments are limited to mathematical benchmarks (MATH, AMC, AIME); no validation on coding, logical reasoning, or multimodal tasks.
- Why unresolved: The approach relies on verifiable rewards and format learning, which may require domain-specific data pipelines and reward engineering for each new domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying Parallel-R1 to domains like code generation with test-case rewards, or logical reasoning with formal verification.

## Limitations

- The alternating reward schedule's effectiveness may be brittle to hyperparameter choices, particularly the 80/20 split and 10-step window
- The structured variant shows consistently lower performance than the causal variant despite architectural isolation, suggesting computational overhead may outweigh benefits
- Cold-start data generation relies on a single strong model (DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen-3-8B), and results may not transfer to weaker generators

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The curriculum design (SFT-then-RL) effectively addresses the cold-start problem, as demonstrated by the stark contrast in parallel thinking success rates between GSM8K (83.6%) and DAPO (0.0%) tasks. The alternating reward mechanism's impact on balancing accuracy and parallel ratio is well-supported by controlled ablations.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that parallel thinking serves as a mid-training exploration scaffold is plausible but not definitively proven. The timing correlation between exploration phase and performance peak is suggestive but could reflect other factors. The superiority of the causal variant over the structured variant is clear, but the architectural reasons remain speculative.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to other model families or reasoning domains beyond mathematics. The optimal hyperparameters for alternating rewards may be task-specific and not transfer to different benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Reward Schedule Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the alternating reward ratio (70/30, 90/10) and window size (5, 15 steps) on Parallel-R1-Seen to determine the robustness of the 80/20 schedule and identify potential overfitting to specific hyperparameters.

2. **Structured Variant Diagnostic**: Implement gradient-based attribution or attention visualization to determine whether the structured variant's underperformance stems from learned mask constraints versus position encoding mismatches, and test whether removing path-window masking (while keeping multiverse encoding) improves results.

3. **Exploration Scaffold Causality**: Design a control experiment where the model undergoes the same number of training steps but with random reward schedules (no alternating pattern) to isolate whether the specific alternating pattern or simply increased exploration time drives the scaffold effect.
