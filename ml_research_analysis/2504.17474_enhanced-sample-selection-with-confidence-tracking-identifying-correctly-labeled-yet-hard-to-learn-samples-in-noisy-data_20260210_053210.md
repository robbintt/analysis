# Enhanced Sample Selection with Confidence Tracking: Identifying Correctly Labeled yet Hard-to-Learn Samples in Noisy Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.17474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17474
- Authors: Weiran Pan; Wei Wei; Feida Zhu; Yong Deng
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 92.15% average F1-score for sample selection and enhances test accuracy by up to 1.6% when integrated with advanced learning-with-noisy-labels approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in learning from noisy labels: distinguishing correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones. Existing methods struggle with this distinction because both types of samples exhibit high loss values. The authors propose Confidence Tracking (CT), a novel approach that monitors trends in model prediction confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. By tracking confidence gaps between annotated labels and other classes using the Mann-Kendall Test, CT identifies samples where all confidence gaps tend to increase, indicating potential correct labels. CT functions as a plug-and-play component that enhances existing sample selection methods.

## Method Summary
Confidence Tracking (CT) is a novel sample selection method that monitors trends in model prediction confidence to identify correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples in noisy data. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on loss values, CT tracks confidence gaps between annotated labels and other classes over time using the Mann-Kendall Test. The method identifies samples where all confidence gaps tend to increase, suggesting that the annotated labels are likely correct despite high losses. CT is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be integrated with existing sample selection methods, enhancing their ability to distinguish between mislabeled and correctly labeled hard samples. The approach is validated across multiple benchmarks and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both sample selection performance (up to 92.15% average F1-score) and test accuracy (up to 1.6% enhancement) when integrated with state-of-the-art learning-with-noisy-labels approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 92.15% average F1-score for sample selection
- Enhances test accuracy by up to 1.6% when integrated with advanced learning-with-noisy-labels approaches
- Demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks and real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by shifting from loss-based identification to confidence trend tracking. While mislabeled and correctly labeled hard samples both produce high losses, their confidence evolution patterns differ. Correctly labeled hard samples show increasing confidence gaps over time as the model learns to distinguish the true class from others. The Mann-Kendall Test statistically detects these monotonic trends in confidence gaps, providing a reliable signal for correct labels even when losses remain high.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Learning with Noisy Labels**: Why needed - Most real-world datasets contain label noise that degrades model performance. Quick check - Can the method handle varying noise rates and types?

2. **Sample Selection Methods**: Why needed - Identifying clean samples is crucial for training robust models on noisy data. Quick check - How does CT integrate with existing selection strategies?

3. **Mann-Kendall Test**: Why needed - Statistical test for detecting monotonic trends in time series data. Quick check - Is the test sensitive enough to detect confidence trends early in training?

4. **Confidence Gap Analysis**: Why needed - Confidence gaps between true and other classes reveal learning progress. Quick check - Are confidence gaps stable across different architectures and datasets?

5. **Plug-and-Play Components**: Why needed - Modular design allows integration with existing methods without complete redesign. Quick check - What are the compatibility requirements for different base methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data -> Model Training -> Confidence Tracking -> Sample Selection -> Model Update

Critical Path: The core pipeline involves continuous model training while simultaneously tracking confidence gaps for each sample. The Mann-Kendall Test runs periodically to evaluate trend significance, feeding into sample selection decisions that influence the next training iteration.

Design Tradeoffs: CT trades computational overhead for improved sample selection accuracy. The method requires storing confidence statistics over time and running statistical tests, but this cost is offset by better model performance. The plug-and-play design prioritizes compatibility over optimization for specific base methods.

Failure Signatures: CT may fail when confidence trends are non-monotonic or when noise patterns create false positive trends. The method assumes that correctly labeled samples show consistent confidence improvement, which may not hold for all data distributions or when model capacity is insufficient.

First Experiments:
1. Validate Mann-Kendall Test sensitivity on synthetic confidence gap data with known trends
2. Test CT integration with a basic sample selection method on a small benchmark dataset
3. Evaluate computational overhead by measuring runtime impact on standard training pipelines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the Mann-Kendall Test's ability to detect confidence trends across different data distributions
- Computational overhead of tracking confidence gaps over time may be prohibitive for large-scale datasets
- Focus on image classification tasks leaves applicability to other domains (NLP, structured prediction) unclear
- Limited real-world dataset coverage with most results from synthetic benchmarks

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core algorithmic contribution using confidence trend tracking via Mann-Kendall Test is well-founded with sound experimental methodology. Improvements over baselines are consistently demonstrated.

**Medium Confidence**: Plug-and-play nature shows promise but may face practical integration challenges. Real-world results are encouraging but based on limited applications.

**Low Confidence**: Scalability analysis is minimal; failure modes and limitations in highly imbalanced datasets are not thoroughly addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate CT's performance and computational efficiency on datasets with 10M+ samples to assess practical scalability limits.

2. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test CT on non-image datasets (e.g., text classification, tabular data) to verify generalizability beyond computer vision tasks.

3. **Robustness Analysis**: Systematically investigate CT's performance under varying noise rates (0-90%) and different noise types (symmetric vs. asymmetric) to establish reliability bounds.
