# An Empirical Study of the Role of Incompleteness and Ambiguity in Interactions with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2503.17936
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17936
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Primary result**: Multi-turn interactions with LLMs are predominantly needed to address incomplete or ambiguous questions, with interaction length correlating to improved answer accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the conditions under which multi-turn interactions between humans and Large Language Models are necessary for accurate question-answering. The authors define and measure incompleteness and ambiguity in questions based on message patterns exchanged during interactions. Using benchmark datasets, they demonstrate that most questions requiring multi-turn interactions are either incomplete or ambiguous, and that increased interaction length reduces these issues while improving answer accuracy. The study provides valuable metrics for characterizing and improving LLM interactions in question-answering contexts.

## Method Summary
The authors define incompleteness and ambiguity in questions based on message patterns observed during human-LLM interactions. They analyze benchmark datasets to identify when multi-turn interactions are needed, measuring the relationship between interaction length and the reduction of incompleteness/ambiguity. The study establishes correlations between these metrics and answer accuracy, providing empirical evidence for how question refinement through interaction improves LLM performance on question-answering tasks.

## Key Results
- Most questions requiring multi-turn interactions are either incomplete or ambiguous
- Increasing interaction length reduces incompleteness and ambiguity
- Correct answers improve as incompleteness and ambiguity decrease

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works because LLMs perform better when questions are clearly specified. When initial questions are incomplete or ambiguous, the model cannot accurately determine user intent, necessitating clarification through multi-turn interaction. As users refine their questions through dialogue, the model receives clearer input that aligns with its training data patterns, enabling more accurate responses.

## Foundational Learning

**Question Completeness**: Why needed: To identify when essential information is missing from queries. Quick check: Verify if all required entities and relationships are present in the question.

**Ambiguity Detection**: Why needed: To recognize when multiple interpretations of a question exist. Quick check: Count the number of valid interpretations a question could have.

**Message Pattern Analysis**: Why needed: To track how questions evolve through interaction. Quick check: Compare initial and final question formulations to identify refinement patterns.

**Interaction Length Metrics**: Why needed: To quantify the extent of dialogue needed for clarification. Quick check: Measure turns until question is complete and unambiguous.

**Answer Quality Assessment**: Why needed: To evaluate the effectiveness of question refinement. Quick check: Compare accuracy rates between initial and final answers.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Question -> LLM Model -> Response -> User Feedback -> Refined Question -> LLM Model -> Final Answer

**Critical Path**: User Question → LLM Response → User Clarification → Refined Question → Final Answer

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes accuracy over interaction efficiency, accepting longer dialogues to achieve better answers rather than optimizing for minimal turns.

**Failure Signatures**: Persistent ambiguity despite multiple turns, questions that remain incomplete after several interactions, or answers that do not improve with clarification.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test the incompleteness metric on questions from diverse domains
2. Validate ambiguity detection across different languages
3. Measure interaction length requirements for various question complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Benchmark datasets may not capture the full diversity of real-world question-answering scenarios
- Metrics for incompleteness and ambiguity may not generalize across all domains or interaction types
- Study focuses primarily on question-answering, limiting applicability to other LLM interaction types
- Causal mechanisms linking reduced incompleteness/ambiguity to improved answers are not fully explored
- Does not establish whether improvements stem from better question formulation, improved LLM understanding, or both

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Most multi-turn interactions involve incomplete or ambiguous questions. Correlation between interaction length and reduction in incompleteness/ambiguity is well-supported by data.

**Medium Confidence**: Proposed measures provide useful tools for characterizing and improving LLM interactions. While promising on benchmarks, practical utility in diverse real-world applications requires further validation.

**Low Confidence**: Correct answers improve "accordingly" with reduced incompleteness and ambiguity. Study establishes correlation but does not rigorously control for confounding variables or establish causation.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a longitudinal study across multiple real-world domains to validate whether incompleteness and ambiguity metrics generalize beyond benchmark datasets.

2. Design controlled experiments to isolate whether improvements in answer quality are due to better question formulation, improved LLM understanding, or a combination of both.

3. Extend the analysis to non-question-answering tasks (e.g., creative writing, code generation) to assess the broader applicability of proposed measures and findings.
