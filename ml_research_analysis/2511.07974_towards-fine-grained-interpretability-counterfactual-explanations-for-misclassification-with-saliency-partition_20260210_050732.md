# Towards Fine-Grained Interpretability: Counterfactual Explanations for Misclassification with Saliency Partition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07974
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07974
- Authors: Lintong Zhang; Kang Yin; Seong-Whan Lee
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 43.02% insertion, 10.27% deletion, compact activation score of 9.53 on CUB-200-2011

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of traditional attribution-based methods by proposing a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that provides granular insights for misclassification analysis. The approach generates object-level and part-level interpretability through a saliency partition module based on Shapley value contributions, enabling the isolation of region-specific relevant features. The method creates explainable counterfactuals by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions between correctly classified and misclassified samples, without relying on generative methods.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) Feature extraction from the last convolutional layer using ResNet-50 or VGG-16; (2) Saliency Partition module computing Shapley value contributions via spatially localized Gaussian kernels (σ=0.8); (3) Iterative counterfactual generation replacing highest Shapley features with semantically similar candidates from a reference set until prediction changes (max 100 iterations). The approach outputs invariant regions and dominant regions, providing clearer insights for human users compared to existing methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 43.02% insertion rate on CUB-200-2011 dataset
- Maintains 10.27% deletion rate on CUB-200-2011 dataset
- Obtains compact activation score of 9.53 on CUB-200-2011
- Demonstrates superiority over existing approaches in capturing granular, intuitively meaningful regions
- Validated on both CUB-200-2011 (200 bird categories, 11,988 images) and Stanford Dogs (20,580 images)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages Shapley value theory to partition feature maps into semantically meaningful regions, allowing for precise identification of which specific features contribute to misclassification. By iteratively replacing high-contribution features with similar ones from correctly classified samples, the method creates counterfactual explanations that reveal the exact regions responsible for prediction errors.

## Foundational Learning
- Shapley value theory for feature attribution: Why needed - to quantify individual feature contributions in cooperative settings; Quick check - verify that Shapley values sum to total prediction for each sample
- Saliency partitioning with Gaussian kernels: Why needed - to create spatially localized regions for fine-grained analysis; Quick check - confirm that kernel responses form expected "dip" patterns around centers
- Iterative counterfactual generation: Why needed - to systematically modify features until prediction changes; Quick check - track convergence within iteration limit

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Feature Extractor -> Saliency Partition -> Counterfactual Generator
Critical path: Misclassified sample I + Reference set U -> Feature extraction -> Shapley computation -> Feature replacement -> New prediction
Design tradeoffs: Generative vs. non-generative approaches (avoids complexity of GANs but may be limited by available reference features)
Failure signatures: Non-convergence within 100 iterations, overly diffuse explanations, failure to capture semantic differences
First experiments: 1) Test Shapley value computation on simple feature maps, 2) Verify Gaussian kernel implementation with known patterns, 3) Run counterfactual generation on synthetic misclassifications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Unknown hyperparameter m for candidate feature filtering not specified
- No fallback strategy described for counterfactual generation failures
- Feature map normalization details between layers not fully specified

## Confidence
- High confidence in overall framework architecture and Shapley value usage
- Medium confidence in specific hyperparameter choices (σ=0.8, 100 max iterations)
- Low confidence in exact implementation of candidate selection and edge case handling

## Next Checks
1. Experiment with different values of m in candidate feature filtering to assess sensitivity
2. Test algorithm behavior on misclassified samples where prediction doesn't change within 100 iterations
3. Compare explanations generated with different Gaussian kernel standard deviations (σ values) to validate σ=0.8 choice
