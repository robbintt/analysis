# On The Role of Intentionality in Knowledge Representation: Analyzing Scene Context for Cognitive Agents with a Tiny Language Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.10000
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10000
- **Reference count**: 23
- **Primary result**: A Tiny Language Model (TLM) can analyze scene context and intentionality in cognitive agents by identifying anomalous patterns in multi-scale n-gram distributions without requiring extensive training or reasoning capabilities.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Tiny Language Model (TLM) approach for analyzing intentionality in text streams by decomposing documents into n-gram fragments at multiple scales and identifying anomalous patterns that indicate intentional content. The method uses Semantic Spacetime and Promise Theory to distinguish between intentional content and ambient context through measures of work investment and temporal spacing. The approach successfully extracts meaningful fragments from narrative texts like Moby Dick and Origin of Species, demonstrating that intentionality can be assessed through relatively simple dynamical analysis of pattern repetition and spacing, with a coherence interval around 45 sentences based on Dunbar numbers.

## Method Summary
The TLM method works by splitting text into parallel n-gram streams (n=1 to 5) and analyzing their distribution patterns against ambient context. Lower-n fragments form "ambient soup" while higher-n fragments are exponentially rarer, thus more likely intentional. The method identifies anomalous gaps in repetition patterns to distinguish intentional content from habitual padding using a work-based scoring formula that penalizes both under- and over-repetition. Intentionality is measured through frequency-weighted scoring combined with string length to capture the computational "work" required to produce patterns. The approach uses a coherence interval (λ ≈ 1/45 sentences) based on human cognitive limitations to determine when intent resets, allowing for dynamic assessment of intent through distance-based decay.

## Key Results
- Intentionality can be identified through multi-scale symbolic fractionation of text streams, with higher-n-grams showing exponential rarity that indicates intentionality
- The method successfully extracted context and intentional fragments from narrative texts including Moby Dick, Origin of Species, and other documents
- Intentionality assessment works through relatively simple dynamical analysis of pattern repetition and spacing without requiring extensive training or reasoning capabilities
- The TLM approach achieves comparable results to more computationally expensive methods while requiring minimal resources and no training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-scale Symbolic Fractionation
- **Claim**: Intentionality can be identified by decomposing text streams into n-gram fragments at multiple scales and analyzing their distribution patterns against ambient context.
- **Mechanism**: Text is split into parallel n-gram streams (n=1 to 5). Lower-n fragments form "ambient soup" while higher-n fragments are exponentially rarer (power law), thus more likely intentional. The method identifies anomalous gaps in repetition patterns to distinguish intentional content from habitual padding.
- **Core assumption**: Intentional content appears as coherent patterns that persist across scales but show irregular spacing (bursts and voids) along the temporal axis.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The method applies symbolic fractionation and interferometry to sort data into intended content and ambient background based on spacetime coherence measures."
  - [section 5.1]: "By the time we reach n = 4 there is little repetition, thus a high degree of uniqueness and intentionality. Longer n-grams behave like proper names and are thus likely places to find the beginnings of invariant concepts."
  - [corpus]: Related work on layered metaphor processing (Meanings are like Onions) supports multi-scale semantic decomposition, though with different theoretical grounding.
- **Break condition**: Very short documents (<100 sentences) show high variability—insufficient data to establish reliable coherence patterns (see Figure 2).

### Mechanism 2: Intentionality as Thermodynamic Work
- **Claim**: Intentionality correlates with the computational "work" required to produce a pattern, measurable through frequency-weighted scoring that penalizes both under- and over-repetition.
- **Mechanism**: Uses the formula I(w, Φ) = Φ(w) W(w) / (1 + exp(Φ(w)/Φ₀ - ρ)) where Φ(w) is occurrence frequency, W(w) is work (string length), and the sigmoid denominator penalizes patterns exceeding the coherence frequency scale. "Goldilocks" frequency patterns score highest—rare enough to be meaningful, common enough to be intentional.
- **Core assumption**: Effort expenditure correlates with intent; incessant repetition indicates habit/padding while moderate repetition with gaps indicates purposeful signaling.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent 'intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and assessing the work done to form them."
  - [section 4.1]: "If the work cost invested in attempting w is great, an agent may be said to intend it more than if the work is low."
  - [corpus]: Weak direct support; "Model-Free RL Agents Demonstrate System 1-Like Intentionality" offers analogous process-based intent detection but without the work-formalism.
- **Break condition**: Assumes uniform work per character; requires adjustment for languages with variable character complexity (e.g., Chinese stroke counts noted in section 4.1).

### Mechanism 3: Longitudinal Coherence with Exponential Decay
- **Claim**: Running intentionality assessment with distance-based decay captures dynamic intent better than static post-hoc frequency analysis.
- **Mechanism**: Uses I(w; τᵢ, τf) = W(w)(1 - e^{-λ(τ - τlast)}) where λ ≈ 1/45 sentences (reciprocal of Dunbar's attentive work number). Re-introducing a concept after a hiatus costs more cognitive work, signaling renewed intent. Competition between learning rate and forgetting rate determines intent assessment.
- **Core assumption**: Human cognition has natural coherence intervals (~45 sentences) over which related intent persists; this scale is physiologically grounded, not document-dependent.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Scale separation can be used to sort parts into 'intended' content and 'ambient context', using the spacetime coherence as a measure."
  - [section 4.2]: "Each time we intend something, after a hiatus, the level of intentionality should peak, since it costs us more work to reconceive of the idea rather than for simple copy-cat repetition."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus support for this specific decay mechanism; related papers focus on belief-intent co-evolution or phenomenological accounts.
- **Break condition**: Human-calibrated λ may not transfer to non-human temporal scales or highly non-linear document structures.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Shannon Entropy vs. Dynamic Information Density
- **Why needed here**: The paper explicitly contrasts its approach with Shannon entropy, which is scale-invariant and loses temporal ordering. Critical for understanding why probability alone cannot capture intent—entropy cannot distinguish bursty from uniform processes.
- **Quick check question**: Why can't Shannon entropy distinguish between a short concentrated episode and a long scattered episode with identical pattern frequencies?

### Concept: Promise Theory Complementary Promises
- **Why needed here**: The theoretical foundation frames intent assessment as requiring two agents: source S promising signal p, and receiver R promising attention to decode it. Intent is never unilaterally determined.
- **Quick check question**: In Promise Theory terms, what two complementary promises are required for an intentionality assessment to occur?

### Concept: Coherence Intervals and Dunbar Numbers
- **Why needed here**: The method relies on cognitive scale parameters (D30 ≈ 45) derived from human social cognition research. This provides the "coherence interval" λ that determines when intent resets.
- **Quick check question**: What cognitive limitation does the coherence interval represent, and why can't intentionality assessment work without such a scale parameter?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map:
Sentence Segmenter -> N-gram Extractor -> Running Frequency Tracker -> Work Calculator -> Intentionality Scorer -> Ambient/Anomalous Classifier -> Multi-scale Aggregator

### Critical Path:
Input text → Sentence tokenization → Parallel n-gram extraction (n=1-5) → Intra-pattern distance calculation → Running intentionality scoring → Ambient/anomalous thresholding → Cross-scale aggregation → Ranked fragment output

### Design Tradeoffs:
- **Static (Eq. 8) vs. Running (Eq. 11)**: Static requires full document before processing; running works incrementally with only coherence-interval memory but shows different convergence behavior (Figure 2, right panels start lower)
- **Memory vs. training**: TLM trades semantic accuracy for zero training cost and negligible computation—suitable for resource-constrained agents
- **Document-relative only**: Cannot compare intentionality scores across documents; scores are meaningful only within each independent stream

### Failure Signatures:
- Short documents (<500 words): "Precarious variability" in Figure 2—insufficient data for stable ranking
- n > 4: Too few repetitions for statistical significance; power law means exponential sparsity
- Stylistically dense texts (e.g., prepared speeches): May lack sufficient ambient context to establish baseline, skewing classifications
- Cross-document comparison: Explicitly stated as invalid—"There is no universal agent. The best we can do is rank agent's effort against itself."

### First 3 Experiments:
1. **Reproduce paper results**: Run TLM on Moby Dick and Origin of Species; verify top-ranked ambient vs. anomalous fragments match examples in section 5.2 (e.g., "sperm whale" as ambient, "whale fishery" as anomalous for Moby Dick)
2. **Coherence interval sensitivity analysis**: Test λ values at 30, 45, 60, and 100 sentences; measure stability of fragment rankings across settings to validate the D30 grounding
3. **Out-of-domain validation**: Apply to non-narrative text (technical documentation, code comments, transcripts) to characterize where human-calibrated parameters fail and what adjustments are needed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How robust is the method across languages with fundamentally different structures (e.g., agglutinative languages, languages that spread verb phrases, character-based writing systems)?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper acknowledges "There is a subtlety for languages that spread phrases, e.g. by sending part of a verb to the end of a sentence in ways that can affect the whole meaning." Only English texts were tested.
- **Why unresolved**: The method assumes word-level tokenization and alphabetic structure that may not transfer directly.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Application of the TLM method to diverse language families with systematic comparison of extracted intentional fragments.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the coherence interval λ be adaptively determined rather than fixed at Dunbar-number-derived values?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper uses D30 and a value of 45 sentences as fixed coherence scales, noting these are "order of magnitude estimates." Short documents show "precarious variability" in stability plots.
- **Why unresolved**: The optimal scale likely varies by document type, genre, and cognitive context, but no adaptive mechanism is proposed.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Experiments varying λ across document types with human evaluation of extracted concepts.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can fragment-level intentionality be composed into higher-order conceptual representations without semantic understanding?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] "If we reach for a high level understanding of intent, we might discount the importance of these low level fragments and seek a linguistic paraphrasing like 'Captain Ahab wants to kill the white whale.' However, no such sentence exists in the text... A more important question... is how would one represent that concept without advanced linguistics—just from the fragments we've produced?"
- **Why unresolved**: The paper extracts meaningful fragments but does not propose a mechanism for combining them into structured conceptual relations.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A systematic method for composing fragments into graph structures with evaluated semantic fidelity.

## Limitations
- The method assumes uniform work cost per character and requires adjustment for languages with variable complexity (e.g., Chinese stroke counts)
- Classification between "ambient" and "intentional" remains somewhat heuristic with "precarious variability" for documents shorter than the coherence interval
- The semantic accuracy trade-offs are not fully characterized against trained models beyond basic examples

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The multi-scale symbolic fractionation mechanism (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the power law distribution of n-grams and the mathematical formulation
- **Medium Confidence**: The thermodynamic work interpretation (Mechanism 2) provides an elegant theoretical framework, but the empirical validation is limited to narrative texts
- **Medium Confidence**: The longitudinal coherence with exponential decay (Mechanism 3) is theoretically motivated by Dunbar numbers, but the specific λ ≈ 1/45 parameter may not transfer to non-human agents

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain robustness testing**: Apply the TLM approach to technical documentation, code comments, and dialogue transcripts to identify where human-calibrated parameters fail and what adjustments are needed for different agent types and communication domains

2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the coherence interval λ (testing values from 30-100 sentences) and the threshold parameters Φ0 and ρ to quantify their impact on fragment classification accuracy and identify optimal settings for different document lengths and styles

3. **Semantic accuracy benchmarking**: Compare the TLM's intentionality rankings against established semantic analysis tools on the same corpora to quantify the trade-off between computational efficiency and semantic precision, particularly for identifying context-rich versus intentionally significant fragments
