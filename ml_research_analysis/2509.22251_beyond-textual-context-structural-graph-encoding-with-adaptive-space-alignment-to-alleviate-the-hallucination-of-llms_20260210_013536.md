# Beyond Textual Context: Structural Graph Encoding with Adaptive Space Alignment to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.22251
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22251
- **Reference count**: 8
- **Primary result**: SSKG-LLM framework improves LLM factual reasoning by 8% across CommonsenseQA, SIQA, and TruthfulQA benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical hallucination problem in large language models (LLMs) by integrating structural and semantic information from knowledge graphs (KGs). The proposed SSKG-LLM framework combines three modules: Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) for extracting relevant subgraphs, Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) for jointly modeling structural and semantic patterns using GraphLM, and Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) for aligning KG embeddings with LLM input spaces through cross-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across three benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of incorporating both structural and semantic information from KGs to enhance factual reasoning abilities of LLMs.

## Method Summary
The SSKG-LLM framework introduces a novel approach to mitigate LLM hallucination by leveraging knowledge graph information through three integrated modules. The KGR module identifies relevant subgraphs from external knowledge sources, the KGE module uses GraphLM to jointly encode structural and semantic patterns within these subgraphs, and the KGA module performs adaptive space alignment through cross-attention mechanisms to bridge the gap between KG embeddings and LLM input spaces. This end-to-end architecture enables LLMs to access both contextual and structural knowledge during inference, significantly improving factual accuracy while maintaining model efficiency.

## Key Results
- SSKG-LLM achieves approximately 8% improvement across CommonsenseQA, SIQA, and TruthfulQA benchmark tasks
- The framework consistently outperforms existing methods in factual reasoning and hallucination reduction
- Integration of both structural and semantic KG information proves more effective than using either modality alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing the fundamental limitation of LLMs operating solely on textual context. By incorporating knowledge graphs, SSKG-LLM provides structured, verifiable knowledge that supplements the probabilistic nature of language model predictions. The adaptive space alignment through cross-attention ensures that the rich structural information from KGs is effectively translated into the semantic space that LLMs naturally operate in, creating a synergistic integration rather than a simple concatenation of information sources.

## Foundational Learning

**Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR)**: Extracts relevant subgraphs from external knowledge sources based on input queries. *Why needed*: Provides the initial bridge between unstructured LLM inputs and structured KG knowledge. *Quick check*: Verify subgraph relevance by measuring overlap between retrieved entities and ground truth knowledge.

**GraphLM**: Jointly encodes structural and semantic patterns within knowledge graphs. *Why needed*: Captures both the topological relationships and semantic meanings within KGs simultaneously. *Quick check*: Compare performance against separate structural and semantic encoders.

**Cross-Attention Alignment**: Maps KG embeddings to LLM input spaces through adaptive transformation. *Why needed*: Bridges the semantic gap between KG representations and LLM token embeddings. *Quick check*: Measure alignment quality through embedding similarity metrics.

**CommonsenseQA**: Benchmark dataset testing common sense reasoning abilities. *Why needed*: Standard evaluation for hallucination in factual reasoning tasks. *Quick check*: Compare against baseline LLM performance on identical splits.

**SIQA**: Social Interaction QA dataset evaluating social commonsense. *Why needed*: Tests model's ability to reason about human interactions and social norms. *Quick check*: Validate improvements across different social reasoning scenarios.

**TruthfulQA**: Dataset measuring truthfulness and factuality in model responses. *Why needed*: Direct assessment of hallucination reduction capabilities. *Quick check*: Analyze false positive rates in truthful responses.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Query -> KGR -> KGE (GraphLM) -> KGA (Cross-Attention) -> LLM Integration

**Critical Path**: The most performance-critical path runs from KGR through KGE to KGA, as delays or errors in any of these components directly impact the quality of KG information available for LLM adaptation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances KG integration depth against computational overhead, using adaptive attention to selectively incorporate KG information rather than full graph integration, which would be prohibitively expensive for large-scale deployments.

**Failure Signatures**: Primary failure modes include KGR retrieving irrelevant subgraphs (leading to noisy KG information), GraphLM failing to capture crucial structural patterns, or KGA misalignment causing semantic drift in LLM outputs.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate KGR module performance on subgraph relevance and coverage metrics
2. Test GraphLM encoding quality on graph reconstruction tasks
3. Validate cross-attention alignment effectiveness on controlled semantic transformation tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only three benchmark datasets (CommonsenseQA, SIQA, and TruthfulQA)
- Lacks detailed statistical analysis including confidence intervals and significance testing
- Does not address computational overhead and scalability concerns with larger knowledge graphs
- Performance on non-commonsense knowledge domains (scientific, technical) remains unexplored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Architectural design and technical implementation details are well-described and methodologically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Quantitative improvements on benchmark datasets are valid but require replication for statistical verification
- **Low confidence**: Generalization claims to broader domains and real-world applications lack empirical support

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing with multiple random seeds across all experiments, reporting confidence intervals for performance improvements
2. Evaluate the framework on additional benchmark datasets representing diverse knowledge domains (e.g., scientific reasoning, factual QA from multiple domains)
3. Measure and report computational overhead metrics including inference time, memory usage, and the impact of increasing KG size on performance and efficiency
