- 15,166 utterances with 279,042 words, integrating audio, video, text, and Greek Sign Language

## Executive Summary
The GLaM-Sign dataset presents a multimodal resource integrating audio, video, text transcriptions, and Greek Sign Language (GSL) translations to enhance accessibility for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals. It contains 30+ hours of Greek-language content with 15,166 utterances and 279,042 words, addressing the scarcity of Greek multimodal datasets. The dataset supports applications including real-time sign language translation, lip-reading AI, and automatic speech-to-text systems. A key contribution is its integration of GSL, which bridges communication gaps for DHH users and sets a benchmark for inclusive AI technologies.

## Method Summary
The dataset creation pipeline involves face detection using the `face_recognition` library to crop videos to 256x256 centered on facial regions, Whisper large-v2 for automatic transcription generation, and a hybrid phonetic correction system combining N-gram statistical models with weighted phonetic distance calculations using IPA representations. FFmpeg extracts audio for processing, while manual review via Subtitle Edit software addresses word-level timestamp misalignments. The GSL translations are synchronized with the audio-video streams, creating a comprehensive multimodal resource for accessibility research and lip-reading applications.

## Key Results
- 92% sentence-level subtitle generation accuracy using Whisper
- 30-40% word-level timestamp precision requiring manual correction
- 15,166 utterances containing 279,042 words and 17,989 unique terms
- Successful integration of four modalities: audio, video, text, and GSL

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multimodal Stream Synchronization
Integrating synchronized audio, video (lip movements), and text creates a unified training signal for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems. The dataset architecture binds spoken audio and visual lip patterns to text transcripts with timestamps, enabling models to disambiguate phonemes that sound similar but look different. This cross-modal attention mechanism relies on precise temporal alignment between audio onset, lip movement, and text timestamp.

### Mechanism 2: Hybrid Phonetic Error Correction
Combining N-gram statistical likelihood with weighted phonetic distance improves automatic transcription quality over raw Whisper outputs. The system first predicts word sequences using N-gram models, then quantifies similarity between confused words using IPA representations through the equation $D = w1 \times |L1 - L2| + w2 \times \Sigma \delta$. Corrections are applied when phonetic distance is low and N-gram probability is high.

### Mechanism 3: Visemic Region Standardization
Standardizing video inputs to 256x256 resolution centered on the face reduces variance and improves model training efficiency. The `crop_video.py` script calculates an average bounding box across frames using the `face_recognition` library, ensuring the lips occupy a consistent feature space critical for convolutional neural networks. This removes background noise and maintains temporal continuity for lip movement analysis.

## Foundational Learning

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Alignment:** Understanding how ASR models generate timestamps vs. text is crucial for diagnosing the gap between sentence-level accuracy (92%) and word-level precision (30-40%). Can you explain why a model might correctly transcribe a sentence but assign wrong start times to specific words?

- **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):** The error correction pipeline converts Greek text to IPA to calculate phonetic distances (e.g., /eˈvre.os/ vs /eˈvre.i.os/). How would you represent the difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants in IPA, and how would that affect the weighted phonetic distance equation?

- **N-gram Language Models:** The system uses bi-grams and tri-grams to context-check Whisper output. You must understand the trade-off: N-grams capture local context well but struggle with long-range dependencies. If the speaker says a proper noun not in the N-gram training corpus, how will the proposed correction pipeline behave?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Video (1280x720) + Audio -> face_recognition (detection) -> crop_video.py (standardization) -> 256x256 Cropped Video -> FFmpeg (audio extraction) -> Whisper Large-v2 (transcription) -> JSON/SRT generation -> TextCleaning -> N-gram Model + Phonetic Similarity Checker -> Subtitle Edit (Manual Review) -> GLaM-Sign Dataset

- **Critical path:** The Subtitle Generation Using Whisper (Section 5.2) is critical, as the dataset's utility for lip-reading hinges on word-level timestamp accuracy. If timestamps are wrong, the lip-video-to-text mapping becomes invalid for training.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Automation vs. Precision - using Whisper for speed but accepting 30-40% word-level error rates requiring manual review. Static vs. Dynamic Cropping - using average bounding boxes for computational efficiency but risking mouth cutoff during extreme head turns.

- **Failure signatures:** Timestamp drift where words appear before lips move, phonetic confusion like "ευρέως" → "εβραίως", and face crop loss resulting in black frames when face_recognition fails detection.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run alignment benchmark: Execute `whisper_transcribe_per_sent_and_per_word.py` on 1-minute clip and manually count timestamp drift to verify 30-40% error rate.
  2. Test Phonetic Corrector: Inject phonetic errors into test subtitle file and run `PhoneticSimilarityFunction.py` to measure correction rate.
  3. Stress Test Face Cropping: Run `crop_video.py` on clip with simulated rapid head movement to determine failure threshold of average bounding box calculation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Reinforcement Learning for Timestamp Accuracy:** How can reinforcement learning and phonetic alignment algorithms specifically improve word-level timestamps currently at 30-40%? The paper plans to incorporate these techniques to address overlapping speech and rapid dialogue challenges. Evidence would be updated benchmarks showing accuracy beyond 40%.

- **Hybrid Framework Optimization:** To what extent does combining machine learning-based phonetic alignment with human-in-the-loop correction optimize synchronization for edge cases? The paper aims to implement this framework to refine cases where current manual review falls short. Evidence would be comparative analysis of processing time and error reduction between current workflow and proposed hybrid approach.

- **Cross-Language Adaptability:** Can the N-gram and IPA-based phonetic correction pipeline be effectively adapted for other under-resourced languages with high morphological complexity? The paper mentions scalability but hasn't demonstrated effectiveness on non-Greek phonetic structures. Evidence would be successful replication on a different language with similar resource constraints.

## Limitations

- Word-level timestamp accuracy of 30-40% creates significant bottleneck for fine-grained lip-reading training
- Phonetic correction pipeline heavily relies on representativeness of N-gram training corpus, failing with vocabulary deviations
- GSL integration lacks detailed validation of synchronization quality with audio-video streams
- Dataset limited to scripted, controlled speech, reducing applicability to spontaneous conversational scenarios

## Confidence

*High Confidence Claims:*
- Dataset successfully integrates four modalities as described
- Face cropping pipeline produces standardized 256x256 outputs
- Overall sentence-level subtitle accuracy of 92% is achievable with Whisper large-v2

*Medium Confidence Claims:*
- 30-40% word-level timestamp accuracy represents systematic limitation requiring manual correction
- N-gram + phonetic distance correction pipeline improves transcription quality over raw Whisper output
- Dataset serves as viable foundation for lip-reading model training despite temporal alignment issues

*Low Confidence Claims:*
- Practical utility for real-time accessibility applications without significant preprocessing
- Effectiveness of GSL integration for actual DHH user comprehension and communication
- Dataset's generalizability to unscripted speech scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Alignment Validation:** Process 5-minute sample video through complete pipeline and manually annotate word-level timestamps to empirically measure actual drift rate between lip movements and transcript words.

2. **Phonetic Correction Robustness:** Create controlled test set with 100 intentionally introduced phonetic errors (both within and outside N-gram corpus vocabulary) and measure correction pipeline's success rate.

3. **GSL Synchronization Quality:** Have 5 DHH individuals with GSL proficiency evaluate 10 randomly selected video segments for sign language-video-audio-text synchronization quality.
