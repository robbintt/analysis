- This work introduces a distribution-free conformal prediction framework for uncertainty quantification in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), addressing the lack of rigorous statistical guarantees in existing PINN UQ methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a conformal prediction framework for uncertainty quantification in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), addressing the critical gap in rigorous statistical guarantees for PINN uncertainty estimates. The framework provides distribution-free prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees, calibrated using a separate validation set. By developing local conformal quantile estimation, the method adapts to spatial heteroskedasticity in PINN predictions while maintaining theoretical validity. Extensive experiments on canonical PDEs demonstrate reliable calibration and locally adaptive uncertainty bands that outperform heuristic approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework constructs prediction intervals for PINN outputs by computing nonconformity scores on a calibration dataset and estimating appropriate quantile thresholds. The nonconformity scores are based on absolute residuals between PINN predictions and true values, ensuring robustness to outliers. For spatially varying uncertainty, the local conformal approach partitions the domain and estimates separate quantile thresholds for each region. The framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to any PINN architecture, requiring only a dedicated calibration set and the PINN's point predictions.

## Key Results
- Achieves empirical coverage close to the expected level of 0.95 across all tested PDE problems
- Average coverage deviation reduced from 0.29-0.41 to 0.03-0.09 after calibration
- Local CP variant excels at identifying regions of elevated uncertainty while maintaining sharper intervals than standard CP
- Outperforms heuristic UQ approaches in terms of calibration reliability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Conformal prediction provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification by leveraging exchangeability of calibration data to construct prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. The framework transforms the UQ problem into a quantile estimation task using nonconformity scores derived from prediction residuals. Local adaptation captures spatial heteroskedasticity by allowing region-specific quantile thresholds, enabling more informative uncertainty estimates that reflect varying confidence levels across the domain. This approach avoids parametric assumptions about residual distributions while maintaining theoretical validity through finite-sample guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal Prediction**: Distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage - needed to provide rigorous statistical guarantees without distributional assumptions; quick check: verify exchangeability of calibration data

**Physics-Informed Neural Networks**: Neural networks trained with PDE residuals as part of the loss function - needed to solve forward and inverse PDE problems with data efficiency; quick check: confirm residual-based loss formulation

**Nonconformity Scores**: Metrics measuring deviation between predictions and observations - needed to quantify prediction quality for interval construction; quick check: ensure scores are permutation invariant

**Quantile Estimation**: Determining threshold values for prediction intervals - needed to calibrate interval width for target coverage; quick check: validate coverage on held-out test data

**Spatial Heteroskedasticity**: Non-constant variance across the prediction domain - needed to justify local adaptation of uncertainty estimates; quick check: examine residual patterns across spatial regions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: PINN model -> Conformal prediction wrapper -> Calibration dataset -> Nonconformity score computation -> Quantile estimation -> Prediction intervals

**Critical Path**: The framework requires a PINN model, a separate calibration dataset, and a method to compute nonconformity scores. The calibration process is independent of the PINN training, allowing for flexible integration with existing PINN implementations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead (additional quantile estimation) for rigorous statistical guarantees. Local adaptation improves uncertainty quantification at the cost of increased computational complexity. The requirement for a calibration set may be limiting in data-scarce scientific computing scenarios.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor coverage may indicate violations of exchangeability assumptions, inadequate calibration set size, or inappropriate nonconformity score choices. Overly conservative intervals suggest quantile overestimation, while undercoverage indicates underestimation.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply standard conformal prediction to a simple PINN on the damped harmonic oscillator problem
2. Compare coverage rates of conformal prediction against heuristic UQ methods on the Poisson equation
3. Evaluate local conformal adaptation on a problem with known spatial heteroskedasticity (e.g., Allen-Cahn equation)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires a dedicated calibration dataset, which may not always be available in scientific computing contexts
- Local conformal approach introduces computational overhead through local quantile estimation
- Assumes calibration data is representative of the test domain, with potential performance degradation if violated
- Nonconformity scores based on absolute residuals may not capture all forms of model inadequacy

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The distribution-free theoretical guarantees of conformal prediction and the empirical coverage results achieving ~95% on test problems

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of local conformal adaptation for spatially varying uncertainty, as this relies on the assumption that local calibration sets are representative

**Medium Confidence**: The computational efficiency claims relative to alternative UQ methods, as runtime comparisons are not explicitly provided

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on problems with stronger nonlinearities or chaotic dynamics to assess robustness beyond the current canonical PDE examples
2. Evaluate performance when the calibration set is significantly smaller or drawn from a different distribution than the test domain
3. Compare computational runtime and memory requirements against alternative UQ methods (e.g., Bayesian PINNs) on large-scale problems
