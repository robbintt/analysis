# Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.27659
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659
- Authors: Alireza Saleh Abadi; Leen-Kiat Soh
- Reference count: 38
- Key outcome: Openness in MARL (dynamic agent populations, tasks, types) systematically violates foundational assumptions of credit assignment, causing significant performance degradation in both temporal (DQN) and structural (MAPPO) credit assignment methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how openness in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments—characterized by dynamic agent populations, tasks, and agent types—complicates the fundamental challenge of credit assignment. Through both conceptual analysis and empirical evaluation, the authors demonstrate that openness events systematically violate key assumptions underlying traditional credit assignment methods. They identify five critical assumptions (stationary environment, fixed agent set, stable reward function, Markov property, and consistent action-outcome mapping) and show how agent, task, and type openness each violate different combinations of these assumptions.

The empirical results using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for temporal credit assignment and Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) for structural credit assignment in a wildfire domain reveal significant performance degradation under openness conditions. The most severe degradation occurs under combined openness where all assumptions are violated simultaneously, leading to increased loss variance, slower convergence, and reduced coordination. The paper identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions for developing openness-aware credit assignment methods that can dynamically adapt to changing environments.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates credit assignment in open agent systems using a cooperative wildfire suppression domain (WS1 configuration: 3×3 grid, two medium fires of intensity 2). Two MARL algorithms are tested: DQN for temporal credit assignment and MAPPO for structural credit assignment. Five openness conditions are examined: no openness (static), agent openness (turnover/absence), task openness (turnover/absence), type openness (equipment degradation/repair), and all openness combined. The authors implement observation padding and action masking to handle variable agent/task counts. Training runs for 160,000 episodes across 250 independent trials with seed 42, measuring average episode reward, loss curves, and convergence speed.

## Key Results
- Openness events systematically violate five foundational assumptions of MARL credit assignment methods
- Performance degradation increases with the number of violated assumptions, with combined openness causing the most severe impact
- DQN shows increased loss variance and unstable value estimates under task openness due to non-stationary reward dynamics
- MAPPO exhibits noisy actor-critic losses under agent openness as centralized critics cannot maintain consistent advantage estimates with changing team composition
- Both algorithms converge more slowly under openness conditions, with convergence time increasing by approximately 1.2x even with padding/masking workarounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Temporal Credit Destabilization via Non-Stationarity
DQN relies on temporal difference learning to propagate rewards backward through time, requiring stable environment dynamics and reward functions. Openness events (task turnover or agent absence) alter these dynamics mid-episode, causing the "max future Q-value" target to become a moving objective. The TD-error becomes noisy, leading to unstable gradient updates and failure to form stable value estimates.

### Mechanism 2: Structural Credit Failure via Team Variability
MAPPO uses a centralized critic to estimate advantage of actions given global state, requiring stable team composition. Agent openness alters the input structure to the critic. When the critic sees a team of 5 agents one moment and 3 the next, the value function oscillates. The actor receives contradictory gradient signals, failing to learn stable coordination.

### Mechanism 3: Combinatorial Assumption Violation
Performance degradation is most severe under combined openness because multiple foundational assumptions are violated simultaneously. The agent cannot distinguish if a penalty resulted from poor action, a missing teammate, or a changed task goal. This disrupts both value estimation and policy gradient flow, causing the learning signal to lose both temporal validity and structural fairness.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**
  - Why needed here: Essential to understand why DQN fails. TD learning bootstraps value estimates from subsequent states; if the "subsequent state" logic changes due to openness, the bootstrap fails.
  - Quick check question: How does a non-stationary environment (changing transition probabilities) affect the Bellman equation update?

- **Concept: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE)**
  - Why needed here: The architecture of MAPPO. You must understand that the "Critic" sees everything (global state), while the "Actor" sees only local info. Openness breaks the Critic's global view.
  - Quick check question: In a CTDE setup, does a change in team size affect the Actor or the Critic more significantly during training?

- **Concept: The Credit Assignment Problem (CAP)**
  - Why needed here: The core problem. You need to distinguish between *Temporal* (which action in time?) and *Structural* (which agent in the team?) credit assignment to diagnose failures.
  - Quick check question: In a cooperative game with a shared global reward, why is it difficult to determine if Agent A or Agent B was responsible for a success?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Environment (Wildfire Domain) -> Preprocessing (Observation Padding, Action Masking) -> Agents (DQN for TCA, MAPPO for SCA) -> Critics/Targets (Target networks for DQN, Centralized Value Functions for MAPPO)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define the specific "Openness Configuration" (e.g., Agent Openness vs. All Openness)
  2. Implement Padding/Masking logic (critical for allowing standard libs to run on open systems)
  3. Train DQN/MAPPO from scratch
  4. Monitor Loss Variance (primary indicator of CAP failure) and Average Reward

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Bounded vs. Unbounded: The paper uses padding to force unbounded openness into bounded tensors. Tradeoff: This allows standard algorithms to run but artificially constrains the problem, potentially underestimating the severity of true unbounded openness.
  - DQN vs. MAPPO: DQN is better for analysis of temporal issues; suffers from unstable Q-values. MAPPO is better for coordination; suffers from shattered advantage estimates when team structure changes.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High Variance Loss: DQN Loss or MAPPO Actor/Critic loss failing to converge or showing extreme spikes
  - Reward Collapse: Significant drop in Average Episode Reward under "All Openness" compared to "No Openness"
  - Slower Convergence: Training takes ~1.2x longer even with workarounds

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Verification: Run DQN/MAPPO in the "No Openness" (static) Wildfire config. Verify smooth loss convergence to establish a control.
  2. Isolated Openness Stress Test: Run MAPPO under *only* Agent Openness. Observe Critic Loss variance to confirm structural CAP sensitivity.
  3. Compound Openness Test: Run DQN under *only* Task Openness. Observe DQN Loss variance to confirm temporal CAP sensitivity to non-stationary rewards.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The analysis focuses specifically on value-based (DQN) and actor-critic (MAPPO) methods, leaving open questions about other MARL approaches
- The study uses a specific wildfire domain with predetermined openness frequencies and magnitudes that may not represent the full spectrum of open agent systems
- The observation padding approach used to handle variable agent counts is a simplification that may mask the true complexity of unbounded openness scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The fundamental mechanism that openness violates core MARL assumptions (stationarity, fixed agent sets, stable rewards) is well-supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific performance degradation patterns observed under different openness types are likely robust, though the exact magnitude may vary with domain parameters.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that combined openness causes the most severe degradation follows logically from the assumption violation analysis, but the non-linear interaction effects between different openness types remain underexplored.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Replicate the experiment in at least one additional domain (e.g., cooperative navigation or resource collection) to verify that openness effects are domain-independent and stem from fundamental CAP violations rather than domain-specific factors.

2. **Alternative MARL Methods**: Test additional algorithms beyond DQN and MAPPO, particularly value decomposition methods (VDN, QMIX) and attention-based approaches, to determine whether certain architectures are more robust to openness than others.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation Analysis**: Implement and evaluate simple openness-aware mechanisms (e.g., adaptive learning rates, dynamic team restructuring) to establish baseline performance improvements and identify which assumption violations are most critical to address.
