# PRIME: Physics-Related Intelligent Mixture of Experts for Transistor Characteristics Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11523
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11523
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: 60%-84% improvement in prediction accuracy for transistor characteristics

## Executive Summary
PRIME is a physics-driven machine learning framework that integrates physics-based knowledge with data-driven intelligence to predict transistor characteristics across multiple operating regions. The framework addresses the challenge of capturing nonlinear current responses in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors by using a mixture-of-experts architecture with a dynamic gating network that adaptively selects appropriate expert models based on input data features. When evaluated on various GAA structures, PRIME achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
PRIME employs a physics-related intelligent mixture of experts (PRIME) framework that combines physics-based knowledge with data-driven machine learning techniques. The architecture consists of multiple expert models, each specialized for different operating regions of transistors, with a dynamic gating network that determines which expert(s) should handle each input. The framework incorporates physical knowledge about operating regions directly into the model structure, allowing it to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between gate voltage and drain current in advanced transistor designs. The mixture-of-experts approach enables the model to handle the diverse operating conditions and geometries of modern transistor architectures while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieved 60%-84% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models
- Reduced mean relative errors to 2.76% for triangular, 1.58% for rectangular, and 1.80% for circular cross-sections
- Successfully predicted both current-voltage characteristics and their derivatives across different device geometries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by integrating physical understanding of transistor operation into the machine learning architecture. By recognizing that different operating regions (cutoff, linear, saturation) exhibit distinct electrical behaviors, PRIME assigns specialized expert models to handle each region while using a gating network to dynamically route inputs. This approach allows the model to leverage both the interpretability of physics-based models and the flexibility of data-driven learning, resulting in improved accuracy for complex transistor characteristics.
