## Executive Summary
This study presents a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous archery action recognition and stress estimation. The authors develop a self-built wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and PPG sensor to collect synchronized motion and physiological data from six adolescent archers during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, they introduce a novel Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff) feature and use an LSTM model, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, they extract HRV features from PPG signals and apply an MLP classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The results demonstrate that integrating motion and physiological sensing provides meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states, offering a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

## Method Summary
The framework collects synchronized accelerometer and PPG data from a wrist-worn device worn on the bow hand of six adolescent archers. Motion phases (draw, aim, release) are manually annotated and labeled using a sliding window approach with the novel SmoothDiff feature, then classified using an LSTM model. Stress levels are self-reported on a 1-5 Likert scale and binarized, with HRV features extracted from PPG signals and classified using an MLP. The motion recognition uses 80-sample (4-second) windows with 5 features (3-axis acceleration, Total Acc, SmoothDiff), while stress detection uses 30-second PPG windows with 11 HRV features. Both models are trained on 70:30 splits with class balancing.

## Key Results
- Motion phase recognition achieved 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score using LSTM with SmoothDiff feature
- Binary stress classification achieved 80% accuracy and 75% F1-score using MLP with HRV features
- The proposed SmoothDiff feature improved F1-score by 7.1% compared to using raw acceleration alone
- Motion recognition maintained high performance across individual athletes with minimal degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The SmoothDiff feature enhances motion phase boundary detection by emphasizing temporal transitions while suppressing high-frequency sensor noise. First-order temporal differencing on the total acceleration magnitude captures the rate of change between consecutive time steps, which amplifies motion transitions. A rolling mean smoothing window then filters out random fluctuations and sensor noise, leaving cleaner signals that reflect broader motion dynamics rather than transient spikes. Core assumption: Motion phase transitions produce distinctive acceleration rate-of-change patterns that differ from idle or noise signals.

### Mechanism 2
HRV features extracted from PPG signals enable binary stress classification by capturing autonomic nervous system activity changes. Psychological stress modulates the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which is reflected in heart rate variability. Time-domain metrics (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50) capture overall and short-term variability, frequency-domain features (HF power) reflect parasympathetic activity, and nonlinear features (Sample Entropy, Poincaré plot SD1/SD2) quantify signal complexity. The MLP learns nonlinear combinations of these features to separate high- and low-stress states. Core assumption: Self-reported stress levels reliably reflect physiological stress states, and HRV features are sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes during archery.

### Mechanism 3
Synchronized multimodal data collection enables separate but temporally aligned analysis of biomechanical and psychological states. A single wrist-worn device with co-located accelerometer and PPG sensor records both modalities at the same sampling rate (20 Hz), with manual event markers synchronized to both signals. This allows motion phases to be labeled independently while stress labels apply at the round level, creating a unified temporal reference frame. Core assumption: Bow-hand wrist motion sufficiently captures the biomechanics of archery phases, and wrist PPG provides adequate signal quality despite arm positioning during draw/aim.

## Foundational Learning

- **Temporal Differencing for Signal Analysis**: Why needed here: SmoothDiff relies on computing `Diff[t] = Total_Acc[t] - Total_Acc[t-1]` to amplify motion transitions. Understanding how differencing acts as a high-pass filter (emphasizing changes, suppressing constant values) is essential for debugging feature quality. Quick check: If your acceleration signal is constant at 9.8 m/s² (stationary), what would the differenced signal show? (Answer: Zero or near-zero values, since consecutive samples are identical)

- **LSTM Memory Cells and Sequential Dependencies**: Why needed here: The motion recognition model must identify phase transitions that span multiple time steps (draw→aim→release). LSTMs use gates (forget, input, output) to selectively retain or discard information across sequences, making them suitable for detecting temporal patterns in sensor data. Quick check: Why might an LSTM outperform a simple RNN for detecting the aim phase, which can have variable duration? (Answer: LSTMs can maintain stable hidden states over longer sequences without gradient vanishing)

- **HRV as Autonomic Nervous System Proxy**: Why needed here: Stress detection relies on the physiological link between autonomic tone and heart rhythm. Sympathetic activation (stress) typically reduces HRV, while parasympathetic dominance increases it. Features like RMSSD and HF power quantify these changes. Quick check: If an athlete's RMSSD drops significantly during competition rounds vs. practice, what does this suggest about their autonomic state? (Answer: Increased sympathetic activity / stress response, as parasympathetic-mediated beat-to-beat variability decreases)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  [Wrist Device: Accelerometer @ 20Hz + PPG @ 20Hz] -> [Synchronized Data Stream + Manual Event Markers] -> [Accelerometer Pipeline] -> [LSTM Model] -> [Motion Phase Output]
                                                                                     ↓
                                                                             [PPG Pipeline] -> [MLP Classifier] -> [Binary Stress Output]

- Critical path:
  1. PPG signal quality during motion -> RR interval extraction accuracy -> HRV feature reliability -> stress classification
  2. Manual annotation timing accuracy -> label alignment -> supervised learning signal quality
  3. SmoothDiff window size (N=20) -> noise reduction vs. temporal resolution trade-off -> motion boundary precision

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **LSTM vs. BiLSTM**: Paper reports BiLSTM achieves 96.80% vs. LSTM's 95.99% accuracy, but LSTM is preferred for real-time deployment since archery is strictly sequential (no future context needed). BiLSTM doubles computation for marginal gain.
  - **Window size (80 samples / 4 seconds)**: Chosen empirically to capture most draw-release motions. Shorter windows risk fragmenting actions; longer windows dilute motion-specific signals with idle data.
  - **Stress label binarization (1-3 vs. 4-5)**: Simplifies classification but discards ordinal information. Threshold at 3.5 assumes meaningful stress difference exists at this boundary—unvalidated.

- Failure signatures:
  - Motion recognition degrades during rapid shots (duration < 2 seconds) or unusually slow shots (> 6 seconds) where fixed windows mismatch actual phase timing
  - Stress classification fails if PPG signal drops during peak muscle tension in draw phase (wrist compression artifacts)
  - Model overfits to individual athletes if trained on small cohort (n=6) without proper cross-validation
  - PQD metric shows systematic over/under-prediction of motion phases, indicating threshold calibration issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate SmoothDiff contribution: Train LSTM with raw 3-axis acceleration only, then add Total Acc, then add SmoothDiff. Compare accuracy, F1, and SLA metrics to isolate each feature's contribution.
  2. PPG quality stress test: Simulate motion artifacts by adding controlled noise to PPG signals during synthetic draw phases. Measure HRV feature stability and stress classification accuracy degradation.
  3. Cross-athlete generalization: Train on 5 athletes, test on 1 held-out athlete (leave-one-subject-out). Compare to random 70:30 split results to assess whether model learns generalizable patterns vs. individual-specific quirks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the proposed framework generalize to adult archers, elite athletes, or different competition environments beyond the adolescent cohort studied? The current dataset was collected from a relatively small cohort of adolescent archers under controlled conditions, which may limit generalizability to other age groups or competition settings. This remains unresolved due to only six adolescents being included with no validation on adults, elite performers, or high-stakes competitions.

### Open Question 2
How would replacing self-reported stress labels with objective biomarkers (e.g., cortisol, galvanic skin response) affect stress classification accuracy and reliability? The stress labeling relied on self-reported measures, which could introduce subjective bias. Expanding the dataset and incorporating objective stress biomarkers would strengthen future analyses. This remains unresolved as the ground-truth stress labels derive from a five-point Likert scale, which is inherently subjective.

### Open Question 3
What is the relationship between detected motion phases, stress levels, and actual shooting performance (target scores)? Incorporating vision-based target scoring systems to link biomechanical and performance outcomes is listed as a future research direction. This remains unresolved as the current framework predicts actions and stress independently but does not quantify their impact on shot accuracy.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=6 adolescent archers) limits generalizability to other age groups and skill levels
- Self-reported stress labels may introduce subjective bias compared to objective physiological biomarkers
- Lack of validation on real-time deployment and field testing conditions

## Confidence
- **High**: Motion recognition results (96.8% accuracy) due to detailed feature engineering and clear evaluation metrics
- **Medium**: Stress classification (80% accuracy) given moderate sample size and binarization approach
- **Low**: Real-world deployment claims due to absence of field testing data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess whether the motion and stress models generalize across different archers rather than overfitting to individual movement patterns.
2. Perform PPG signal quality assessment during the draw phase by comparing RR interval extraction accuracy with and without motion artifacts, using a reference chest-worn ECG if available.
3. Implement real-time inference pipeline to measure latency and computational requirements of the LSTM model on embedded hardware, verifying that predictions remain stable under continuous data stream conditions.
