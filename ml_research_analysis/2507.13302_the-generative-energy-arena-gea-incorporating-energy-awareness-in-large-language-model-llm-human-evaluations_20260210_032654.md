core_contribution: This paper presents the Generative Energy Arena (GEA), a platform
  designed to study how energy consumption awareness affects human evaluation of large
  language models (LLMs). The GEA addresses the challenge of incorporating energy
  awareness into LLM evaluation by presenting users with pairs of model responses
  and their relative energy consumption information.

# The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.13302
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Energy awareness changes LLM evaluation outcomes, with 46% of users switching votes and smaller models winning 75% of comparisons

## Executive Summary
The Generative Energy Arena (GEA) is a novel platform that investigates how energy consumption awareness affects human evaluation of large language models. The study reveals that when users are informed about the energy difference between model responses, they significantly change their evaluation preferences. The platform presents pairs of model responses alongside their relative energy consumption information, allowing users to make informed choices that balance quality and energy efficiency. The research demonstrates that energy awareness can shift user preferences toward more energy-efficient models without substantial quality compromises.

## Method Summary
The GEA platform implements a two-step evaluation process where users first select the better response based solely on quality, then reconsider their choice after being informed about the energy difference. The study collected 694 responses from MOOC students comparing different model families including GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1 vs GPT-4.1-mini, Claude Sonnet vs Haiku, and Llama3-70b vs Llama3-8b. Users evaluated responses to synthetic prompts across various domains, with energy consumption data obtained through APIs when available or estimated otherwise. The platform tracks both initial and reconsidered votes to quantify the impact of energy awareness on user preferences.

## Key Results
- Users changed their votes 41-52% of the time after learning about energy differences, averaging around 46%
- Smaller models won 75% of comparisons when energy awareness was factored in
- GPT-4o-mini was chosen over GPT-4o in 45% of evaluations after energy information was provided
- The energy-quality trade-off varies significantly across different model families and comparison pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind GEA's effectiveness lies in its dual-stage evaluation approach that decouples quality assessment from energy considerations. By first capturing pure quality preferences without energy bias, then introducing energy information to observe preference shifts, the platform reveals how much energy awareness actually influences decision-making. This method isolates the cognitive process where users weigh quality benefits against energy costs, demonstrating that for most interactions, the marginal quality improvements of larger models do not justify their substantially higher energy consumption.

## Foundational Learning
- **Energy-aware evaluation** - Understanding how to incorporate sustainability metrics into AI assessment frameworks; needed to address growing concerns about AI's environmental impact; quick check: measure preference shifts with/without energy data
- **Model pairing methodology** - Systematically comparing similar models with different computational costs; needed to isolate quality vs efficiency trade-offs; quick check: verify consistent evaluation criteria across pairs
- **Synthetic vs real-world prompts** - Using controlled prompts to ensure comparable response quality; needed for fair model comparisons; quick check: validate prompt selection covers diverse use cases
- **API-based energy estimation** - Collecting actual vs estimated energy consumption data; needed for accurate environmental impact measurement; quick check: compare API measurements against estimates
- **User preference analysis** - Quantifying how information disclosure affects decision-making; needed to understand behavioral responses to sustainability metrics; quick check: track initial vs reconsidered votes
- **Statistical significance testing** - Determining whether observed preference shifts are meaningful; needed to validate experimental results; quick check: apply appropriate statistical tests to vote changes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** User Interface -> Response Pairing Engine -> Energy Data Fetcher -> Evaluation Tracker -> Results Analyzer

**Critical path:** The evaluation workflow follows: user receives paired responses → user makes initial quality-based selection → system fetches/estimates energy data → user views energy information → user may reconsider choice → system records both votes → results are aggregated and analyzed

**Design tradeoffs:** The platform balances between controlled synthetic prompts (ensuring fair comparisons) and real-world relevance (limiting external validity). It uses API-based energy measurements when available but falls back to estimations, trading accuracy for broader model coverage.

**Failure signatures:** Poor model pairing could lead to meaningless comparisons; inaccurate energy estimations could bias results; homogeneous user populations could limit generalizability; synthetic prompts might not reflect real usage patterns.

**Three first experiments:** 1) Test with diverse user demographics beyond MOOC students; 2) Validate energy estimations against actual measurements across multiple model families; 3) Compare results using real-world application prompts versus synthetic ones.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Participant pool consists primarily of MOOC students rather than representative LLM users
- Evaluation scenarios use synthetic prompts rather than real-world usage contexts
- Study only examines four model pairs from three model families
- Results may not generalize across different application domains or user demographics

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| 46% of users change votes when informed about energy consumption | Medium |
| Smaller models win 75% of comparisons after accounting for energy awareness | Medium |
| Energy awareness significantly influences LLM evaluation outcomes | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a more diverse participant pool representing actual LLM users across different professional and demographic backgrounds
2. Test additional model pairs and families beyond the four pairs studied, including newer models and different architecture types
3. Conduct field studies using real-world LLM applications rather than synthetic prompts to validate findings in practical contexts
