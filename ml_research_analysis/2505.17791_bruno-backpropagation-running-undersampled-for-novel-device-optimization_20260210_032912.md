# Bruno: Backpropagation Running Undersampled for Novel device Optimization

- Trains spiking neural networks with FeLIF neurons and quantized RRAM synapses using dual-timescale backpropagation

## Executive Summary
BRUNO introduces a dual-timescale training method for spiking neural networks with hardware-specific neuron models like FeLIF. By using fine-grained forward simulation (1 µs) and coarse backpropagation (1 ms), BRUNO achieves 97-99% memory reduction and 50-60% training time reduction compared to standard BPTT while maintaining or improving accuracy. The method is validated on music prediction (JSB chorales) and Braille letter recognition tasks using RRAM-based quantized synapses.

## Method Summary
BRUNO implements dual-timescale training where neuron states are computed at 1 µs resolution during forward pass but gradients are computed only at 1 ms resolution. The key innovation is a detach-and-subtract operation that preserves fine-grained dynamics for simulation while reducing computational graph size for backpropagation. The method combines surrogate gradient learning for spike thresholds with quantization-aware training using stochastic rounding for RRAM synapses. FeLIF neurons integrate ferroelectric polarization dynamics with membrane potential to improve robustness to low-bit quantization.

## Key Results
- BRUNO reduces memory usage by 97-99% and training time by 50-60% compared to BPTT
- FeLIF neurons achieve 74.73% accuracy at 3-bit quantization on Braille task versus 40.48% for feedforward LIF
- Comparable or better performance than BPTT on JSB chorales and Braille letter recognition
- Effective across multiple quantization levels with FeLIF maintaining performance where LIF degrades significantly

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Dual-timescale training reduces memory and time while preserving gradient flow for physics-based neuron models
- Uses millisecond-scale states for backpropagation via detach-and-subtract operation while maintaining microsecond-scale dynamics for simulation
- Assumes millisecond-scale state trajectory approximates gradient direction sufficiently for convergence
- Evidence: BRUNO achieves similar or better loss curves compared to BPTT; reduces computational graph size by ~1000×

### Mechanism 2
- FeLIF neurons improve robustness to low-bit weight quantization through dual state variables
- Integrates membrane potential with ferroelectric polarization dynamics for extended temporal filtering
- Assumes polarization dynamics provide temporal integration less sensitive to quantization noise than single-timescale LIF
- Evidence: 3-bit FeLIF achieves 74.73% accuracy vs 40.48% for feedforward LIF on Braille task

### Mechanism 3
- Quantization-aware training with stochastic rounding enables convergence with simulated RRAM synapses
- Uses straight-through estimator for gradient computation through rounding operation
- Assumes stochastic rounding distribution approximates RRAM programming variability sufficiently
- Evidence: 3-bit quantized states show distinguishable distributions with ~20 µS gap between states

## Foundational Learning

- **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: Standard method for training RNNs requires storing hidden states at every timestep, creating memory bottleneck for high-temporal-resolution models. Quick check: Can you explain why BPTT requires storing hidden states at every timestep in the computational graph?

- **Surrogate Gradient Learning**: Enables backpropagation through spiking neurons by replacing non-differentiable spike functions with differentiable approximations. Quick check: Why can't standard backpropagation be applied directly through a spike generation function?

- **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: Bridges continuous training and discrete hardware deployment by simulating quantization effects during training. Quick check: What is the straight-through estimator and why is it needed for quantization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: FeLIF neuron model (Equations 1-3) -> BRUNO training loop (Algorithm 1) -> RRAM synapse model (JART VCM) -> Quantization operator (Equations 4-5)

- **Critical path**: 1) Implement FeLIF forward dynamics at 1 µs timestep 2) Add millisecond-scale state computation with detach operation 3) Integrate surrogate gradient for spike threshold 4) Wrap weight updates with QAT stochastic rounding

- **Design tradeoffs**: Finer forward timestep improves accuracy but increases computation; lower quantization bits reduce hardware cost but require recurrent connections or FeLIF neurons for maintained performance; BRUNO memory savings vs checkpointing memory-time tradeoff

- **Failure signatures**: Divergent loss with unstable gradient magnitudes suggests backward timestep too coarse; high variance across seeds with quantization suggests quantization levels overlap; mismatch between Python model and SPICE suggests parameter initialization issues

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate BRUNO convergence vs BPTT on JSB chorales 2) Quantization sweep: Train FeLIF and LIF at FP32, 8-bit, 4-bit, 3-bit on Braille task 3) Memory/time profiling: Measure peak memory and backward pass time for BRUNO vs BPTT vs checkpointing across sequence lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit limitations include hardware deployment validation, scalability to deeper networks, and generalization to other physics-based neuron models.

## Limitations
- Exact surrogate gradient function for spike thresholds not specified, affecting reproducibility
- FeLIF device parameters have ~10% variability across neurons requiring potential per-neuron calibration
- Coarse backward timestep (1 ms) may miss critical gradient information for tasks requiring precise spike timing

## Confidence
- High confidence in dual-timescale training mechanism and memory/time reduction claims
- Medium confidence in FeLIF quantization robustness claims
- Medium confidence in RRAM device modeling fidelity

## Next Checks
1. Gradient sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary backward timestep (0.1 ms to 10 ms) on JSB chorales to identify where gradient quality degrades
2. Cross-task temporal precision: Evaluate BRUNO-trained FeLIF on spike-timing-dependent task (e.g., temporal order recognition)
3. Hardware-in-the-loop validation: Deploy trained weights to actual RRAM crossbar arrays with measured conductance variability
