# Cleaning English Abstracts of Scientific Publications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24459
- Reference count: 3
- Model achieves precision of 0.973, recall of 0.919, and F1-score of 0.945 in cleaning English scientific abstracts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Abstract Cleaner, a language model designed to remove extraneous clutter from English-language scientific abstracts, including copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registration information, and bibliographic metadata. The model is trained on 9,000 labeled abstracts from the Scopus database using spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) framework. The system demonstrates high performance metrics (precision 0.973, recall 0.919, F1-score 0.945) and is designed to operate conservatively, prioritizing the preservation of relevant content over aggressive clutter removal. The Abstract Cleaner is publicly available on Hugging Face and can be integrated into existing pipelines for scientometric analyses.

## Method Summary
The Abstract Cleaner employs spaCy's NER framework to identify and remove clutter from scientific abstracts. The model was trained on a dataset of 9,000 manually labeled abstracts from the Scopus database, with each abstract containing at least one instance of clutter. The training data was generated using a set of regular expressions to identify different types of clutter, including copyright statements, author notes, registration information, and bibliographic metadata. The model uses a conditional random field algorithm to recognize entity spans, which are then removed from the abstract. The system is designed to be conservative in its cleaning approach, avoiding the removal of potentially relevant content while still effectively eliminating clutter.

## Key Results
- The Abstract Cleaner achieves precision of 0.973, recall of 0.919, and F1-score of 0.945 on test data
- Correctly cleans over 96% of abstracts with clutter while rarely removing relevant content from abstracts without clutter
- Improves information content of standard-length embeddings and alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts
- Demonstrates conservative cleaning approach that avoids false positives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Abstract Cleaner works by leveraging spaCy's Named Entity Recognition framework to identify and remove specific patterns of clutter from scientific abstracts. The model was trained on a large, manually labeled dataset of 9,000 abstracts, allowing it to learn the distinctive patterns and contexts in which clutter typically appears. By using a conditional random field algorithm, the system can recognize entity spans that correspond to different types of clutter, such as copyright statements, author notes, and bibliographic metadata. The conservative approach ensures that relevant content is preserved while effectively removing extraneous information that could distort downstream analyses.

## Foundational Learning
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The model uses spaCy's NER framework to identify specific patterns in text. This is needed to accurately detect different types of clutter in abstracts. Quick check: Review spaCy's NER documentation and understand how entity spans are defined and processed.
- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)**: The system employs CRFs to recognize entity spans. This is needed for accurate pattern matching in text. Quick check: Understand how CRFs work in spaCy and how they differ from other sequence labeling approaches.
- **Conservative Cleaning Approach**: The model prioritizes avoiding false positives over aggressive clutter removal. This is needed to ensure relevant content is not accidentally removed. Quick check: Review the model's performance metrics, particularly precision and recall, to understand the tradeoff.
- **Regular Expression Pattern Matching**: Initial data labeling used regex patterns to identify clutter types. This is needed to create the training dataset. Quick check: Examine the regex patterns used and how they were validated against human annotations.
- **Embedding Similarity Preservation**: The model aims to maintain semantic similarity after cleaning. This is needed to ensure cleaned abstracts remain useful for downstream tasks. Quick check: Review the similarity analysis results to understand how cleaning affects semantic content.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Abstract -> spaCy NER Model -> Clutter Detection -> Entity Removal -> Clean Abstract

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves text input flowing through the NER model, where entities corresponding to clutter are identified and removed. The spaCy pipeline processes the text, identifies entity spans using the trained model, and generates the cleaned output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff is between cleaning aggressiveness and content preservation. The conservative approach minimizes false positives but may leave some clutter behind. This design choice prioritizes reliability over completeness, making the model suitable for applications where preserving original content is critical.

**Failure Signatures**: The model may fail to remove citations (only 55% correctly cleaned) and may struggle with non-standard formatting patterns. Performance may degrade on abstracts with unusual structures or those containing content that resembles clutter but is actually relevant.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test the model on a sample of abstracts with known clutter to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate cleaning performance on abstracts containing citations to understand the specific weakness
3. Compare similarity scores between raw and cleaned abstracts to verify semantic preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the analysis, several important questions remain unresolved regarding the model's limitations and potential improvements.

## Limitations
- The model's performance on abstracts containing citations is significantly lower (55% accuracy) compared to other clutter types
- Lack of human validation studies to confirm whether cleaned abstracts truly preserve original semantic content
- No comparison with simpler rule-based or regex-based cleaning methods to demonstrate the added value of using a language model
- Limited evaluation of impacts on downstream tasks beyond similarity preservation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The model's precision (0.973) and F1-score (0.945) on the test set, given the large labeled dataset (9,000 abstracts) and automated evaluation metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that cleaning alters similarity rankings, as this is demonstrated but not validated against actual downstream task performance
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that the conservative approach "rarely removes relevant content" without extensive human validation studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human validation study to verify that cleaned abstracts preserve original semantic content
2. Benchmark the model against simple regex-based cleaning methods on the same test set
3. Test the model's performance on non-English abstracts or abstracts with non-standard formatting patterns
