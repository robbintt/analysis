core_contribution: We trained linear classifiers on hidden states from early reasoning
  tokens in math-focused chain-of-thought outputs, finding that correctness is already
  highly predictable within just 4-8 tokens, with ROC-AUC up to 0.84. This early signal
  persists across varying CoT lengths and remains robust when controlling for question

# Temporal Predictors of Outcome in Reasoning Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14773

- One-line primary result: Linear probes on early reasoning tokens predict correctness with ROC-AUC up to 0.84, before models verbalize answers

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that reasoning language models encode information about eventual answer correctness in their hidden states much earlier than their explicit chain-of-thought outputs suggest. By training linear classifiers on pooled hidden states from just 4-8 tokens into the reasoning process, the work achieves ROC-AUC scores up to 0.84 on math problems, indicating that models internally track solution quality far earlier than they reveal. The observed decline in accuracy for longer CoTs reflects increasing proportions of hard problems rather than signal decay, with probe accuracy remaining stable within difficulty buckets. Output-space baselines (entropy, length) performed significantly worse, confirming that latent activations carry distinct self-assessment information beyond surface-level uncertainty measures.

## Method Summary
The study uses MATH dataset stratified by difficulty (750 easy, 750 hard problems), generating chain-of-thought completions with greedy decoding (max 512 tokens) from Qwen3-8B and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct models. For each solution, the method pools final hidden states of the last 4 tokens at each prefix length t ∈ {4,8,16,32,64,128,192,256,384,512}, reduces to ≤128 components via PCA, and trains ℓ2-regularized logistic regression probes (80/20 stratified split with balanced class weights) to predict eventual correctness. Performance is evaluated against output-space baselines using ROC-AUC and accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Linear probes on early reasoning tokens achieve ROC-AUC up to 0.84 and accuracy 0.76 at t=4
- Probe accuracy remains nearly constant within difficulty buckets across all prefix lengths
- Output-space baselines (entropy, length) achieve maximum ROC-AUC of 0.59, over 0.21 below hidden-state probes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Early Latent Commitment
Hidden states from first few reasoning tokens encode linearly decodable information about eventual answer correctness before the model verbalizes its solution. As the model processes a question and begins CoT generation, residual stream representations accumulate evidence about solution trajectory that a linear probe can extract from pooled hidden states, achieving ROC-AUC of 0.84 on Qwen3-8B.

### Mechanism 2: Difficulty-Driven Selection Artifact
The observed decline in probe accuracy at longer prefix lengths reflects sample composition shifts rather than signal decay. Harder questions require longer CoTs, so as t increases, shorter/easier items exit the pool, leaving only hard items with lower base correctness and noisier signals.

### Mechanism 3: Latent vs. Output-Space Divergence
Hidden-state probes capture correctness information that output-space heuristics (entropy, length) cannot access. Next-token entropy and prefix length are weak proxies for internal confidence because they reflect surface uncertainty rather than accumulated solution evidence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear Probing of Hidden States
  - Why needed here: The method extracts interpretable signals from high-dimensional residual stream activations using logistic regression. Without understanding that probes test whether information is linearly accessible, readers may overinterpret results as functional self-monitoring.
  - Quick check question: If a probe achieves 0.84 AUC, does this prove the model is consciously tracking its correctness? (Answer: No—only that the information is linearly decodable.)

- Concept: Selection Bias in Temporal Analysis
  - Why needed here: The paper's central counterintuitive finding hinges on recognizing that longer-prefix analyses filter out short CoTs, skewing the sample toward hard problems.
  - Quick check question: Why does probe accuracy appear to drop at t=512 even though signal strength is stable? (Answer: Only hard items survive to t=512; the pool composition changes.)

- Concept: ROC-AUC vs. Accuracy
  - Why needed here: The paper reports both metrics; ROC-AUC is class-imbalance-robust while accuracy is not. Understanding this prevents misreading accuracy drops as probe failure.
  - Quick check question: If a dataset has 90% incorrect labels, what does 76% accuracy imply about probe quality? (Answer: Barely above chance; ROC-AUC provides a clearer signal.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data sampler → Model inference → Hidden-state extractor → PCA reducer → Probe trainer
- Critical path: Generate CoT traces → Extract and pool hidden states at each prefix → Fit separate probes per prefix → Evaluate on held-out set, stratified by difficulty
- Design tradeoffs: Single dataset (MATH) limits generalization; final layer only may miss earlier dynamics; linear probe is simple but may miss non-linear signals
- Failure signatures: Probe AUC drops to ~0.5 with shuffled labels (leakage); baseline AUC approaches probe AUC (surface cues); large performance gap between easy/hard persists (hard problems lack early signal)
- First 3 experiments: Replicate on non-math dataset (e.g., commonsense QA); add intermediate-layer probes; run non-linear probes (MLP) to check decodability ceiling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Does early correctness signal generalize to non-mathematical domains and larger model scales?
- Do probed hidden states causally influence final output or merely correlate with surface cues?
- Can early correctness signal be utilized for effective online intervention (dynamic halting or self-reflection)?

## Limitations
- Results based exclusively on math-focused chain-of-thought reasoning, may not generalize to other domains
- Probe could exploit shallow cues embedded in hidden states rather than genuine solution trajectory
- Study uses only final layer hidden states, missing potential temporal dynamics in intermediate layers

## Confidence
- Early Signal Detection (ROC-AUC up to 0.84): Medium confidence
- Difficulty-Driven Selection Artifact: High confidence
- Latent vs. Output-Space Divergence: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Replicate temporal probing experiment on non-math reasoning dataset (e.g., CommonsenseQA) to test domain generality
2. Extract and probe hidden states from intermediate layers (12, 18, 24) in addition to final layer
3. Train MLP probes on same pooled hidden states to compare ROC-AUC against linear probes
