# Bilevel optimization for learning hyperparameters: Application to solving PDEs and inverse problems with Gaussian processes

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05568
- Reference count: 40
- Authors propose bilevel optimization framework for hyperparameter learning in PDE and inverse problems with Gaussian processes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a bilevel optimization framework for learning hyperparameters in scientific computing applications, specifically addressing the challenge of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and inverse problems using Gaussian processes. The method balances data fidelity with smoothness in an inner optimization problem while selecting hyperparameters to minimize regularized validation loss in an outer optimization loop. The key innovation involves using Gauss-Newton linearization to approximate the inner optimization step, providing closed-form updates that eliminate the need for repeated expensive PDE solves. This approach significantly improves computational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing accuracy in solving complex PDE problems.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a bilevel optimization framework where the inner problem estimates the model by balancing data fidelity with smoothness, while the outer problem selects hyperparameters to minimize a regularized validation loss. The key innovation is a Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step, which provides closed-form updates and eliminates the need for repeated costly PDE solves. This approach reduces each iteration of the outer loop to a single linearized PDE solve, followed by explicit gradient-based hyperparameter updates. The method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments on Gaussian process models applied to nonlinear PDEs and PDE inverse problems.

## Key Results
- Learned hyperparameters lead to significantly lower L2 and L∞ errors in solving the Eikonal and Burgers' equations using non-stationary Gibbs kernels parameterized by neural networks
- Substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to conventional random hyperparameter initialization
- Demonstrated scalability and effectiveness for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization, particularly in experiments with additive kernels and neural network-parameterized deep kernels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The bilevel optimization framework works by decomposing the hyperparameter learning problem into two nested optimization problems. The inner problem learns the model parameters while balancing data fidelity with smoothness regularization, ensuring that the solution respects both the observed data and the underlying physical constraints. The outer problem then optimizes hyperparameters to minimize a validation loss, effectively learning which model configurations generalize best. The Gauss-Newton linearization is critical because it provides an efficient approximation of the inner problem's solution, enabling gradient-based updates to hyperparameters without requiring expensive repeated PDE solves. This linearization captures the essential curvature information needed for stable hyperparameter updates while maintaining computational tractability.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Hyperparameter space -> Outer optimization -> Gauss-Newton linearization -> Inner optimization -> PDE solver -> Model parameters

Critical path: The critical computational path involves computing the Gauss-Newton approximation of the inner problem solution, then using this approximation to compute gradients of the validation loss with respect to hyperparameters. This allows efficient gradient-based updates without requiring full PDE solves at each hyperparameter evaluation.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades off approximation accuracy (through Gauss-Newton linearization) against computational efficiency. While the linearization provides significant speedups, it may introduce errors for strongly nonlinear problems or complex geometries. The choice of kernel functions and their parameterization (e.g., neural networks) also affects both computational complexity and solution quality.

Failure signatures: The method may fail when the Gauss-Newton approximation becomes inaccurate, which can occur for highly nonlinear PDEs, problems with discontinuities, or when the initial hyperparameter guess is far from optimal. Computational inefficiencies may arise when the linearized PDE solve itself becomes expensive due to complex problem geometries or boundary conditions.

Three first experiments:
1. Test the method on a simple linear PDE (e.g., Poisson equation) to verify basic functionality and compare against baseline approaches
2. Evaluate the accuracy of the Gauss-Newton linearization approximation across different problem regimes by comparing against full nonlinear solves
3. Conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis to understand how different kernel choices and neural network architectures affect solution quality and computational efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method relies on Gauss-Newton linearization assumptions that may not hold for all PDE problems, particularly those with strong nonlinearities or discontinuities
- Computational efficiency gains depend critically on the accuracy of the linearization approximation, which may degrade for complex problem geometries or boundary conditions
- Reported improvements are demonstrated primarily on specific test cases (Eikonal and Burgers' equations) using particular kernel choices, raising questions about generalizability to other PDE types and kernel families
- Scalability claims lack comprehensive validation across diverse problem scales and dimensionalities
