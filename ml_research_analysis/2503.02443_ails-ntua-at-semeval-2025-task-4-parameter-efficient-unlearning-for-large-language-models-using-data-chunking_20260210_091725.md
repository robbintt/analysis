# AILS-NTUA at SemEval-2025 Task 4: Parameter-Efficient Unlearning for Large Language Models using Data Chunking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02443
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: None

## Executive Summary
The paper presents AILS-NTUA's approach to SemEval-2025 Task 4, focusing on parameter-efficient unlearning for large language models using data chunking. The method addresses the challenge of removing unwanted knowledge from LLMs while maintaining computational efficiency. The team implements a strategy that combines selective parameter updates with strategic data partitioning to achieve targeted unlearning.

## Method Summary
The approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques combined with data chunking strategies to perform selective unlearning in large language models. By partitioning the training data into manageable chunks and applying LoRA-based parameter updates, the method achieves targeted knowledge removal while preserving model capabilities. The implementation focuses on minimizing computational overhead while maintaining unlearning effectiveness through strategic parameter selection and update scheduling.

## Key Results
- No key results provided in source material
- Methodology focused on task approach rather than reported performance metrics
- Emphasis on parameter efficiency and unlearning effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism works by selectively updating a small subset of model parameters while processing chunked data segments. This approach reduces computational requirements compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining the ability to effectively remove targeted knowledge. The chunking strategy allows for more controlled and focused unlearning operations, preventing catastrophic forgetting of desired capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, adapters): Enables model adaptation with minimal parameter updates, reducing computational cost
- Data chunking strategies: Allows processing of large datasets in manageable segments for controlled unlearning
- Selective knowledge removal: Targets specific unwanted information while preserving desired capabilities
- Catastrophic forgetting prevention: Ensures essential model knowledge is retained during unlearning

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Chunking -> Parameter-Efficient Updates -> Knowledge Removal -> Validation
**Critical Path**: Chunked data processing → Selective parameter updates → Unlearning verification → Performance assessment
**Design Tradeoffs**: Parameter efficiency vs. unlearning completeness; Chunk size vs. update granularity; Computational cost vs. effectiveness
**Failure Signatures**: Incomplete unlearning, excessive parameter changes, knowledge retention failures
**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Small-scale unlearning test with synthetic data, 2) Parameter efficiency comparison with full fine-tuning, 3) Chunk size optimization study
