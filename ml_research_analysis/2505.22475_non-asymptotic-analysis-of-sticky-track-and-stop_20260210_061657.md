# Non-Asymptotic Analysis of (Sticky) Track-and-Stop

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.22475
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22475
- **Authors:** Riccardo Poiani; Martino Bernasconi; Andrea Celli
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First finite-confidence analysis of TAS and S-TAS algorithms for pure exploration, showing E_μ[τ_δ] ≤ 10K⁴ + π²/24 + T₀(δ).

## Executive Summary
This paper provides the first finite-confidence analysis of the Track-and-Stop (TAS) and Sticky Track-and-Stop (S-TAS) algorithms for pure exploration in multi-armed bandits. Previous analyses were only asymptotic, leaving finite-δ behavior unknown. The authors introduce a novel good-event-based framework to analyze these algorithms, showing they achieve near-optimal finite-confidence performance with sample complexity bounds that recover known asymptotic optimality when δ → 0.

## Method Summary
The analysis introduces C-Tracking, a sampling rule that computes oracle weights ω(t) ∈ ω^*(μ̃(t)) and tracks cumulative arm pulls with forced exploration ε_t ≈ t^(-1/2). The stopping rule checks if max_i inf_λ ∑_k N_k(t)d(μ̂_k(t), λ_k) ≥ β_{t,δ}. For TAS, this connects to information accumulation at rate T^*(μ)⁻¹, while S-TAS adds a "sticking" mechanism to handle multiple correct answers via candidate sets and upper hemicontinuity. The key insight is decomposing E[τ_δ] via good events where empirical estimates concentrate.

## Key Results
- Both TAS and S-TAS achieve near-optimal finite-confidence performance
- TAS sample complexity: E_μ[τ_δ] ≤ 10K⁴ + π²/24 + T₀(δ)
- S-TAS adds problem-dependent constant T_μ reflecting answer set complexity
- Bounds recover asymptotic optimality when δ → 0
- Analysis reveals TAS's tracking approximates optimal strategy while S-TAS's sticking ensures convergence with multiple solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Good-Event-Based Finite-Time Analysis
- **Claim:** Expected stopping time bounded by identifying time after which "good event" (empirical mean concentration) implies stopping.
- **Mechanism:** Define events E_t where empirical KL divergences concentrate; these events have bounded failure probability ∑ P(E_t^c) ≤ π²/24. If E_t ⊆ {τ_δ ≤ t} for t ≥ T_0(δ), then E[τ_δ] ≤ T_0(δ) + π²/24.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 5-6] analysis under sequence of good events; [Page 13] Lemma 1 formalizes expectation upper bound.
- **Break condition:** If concentration fails repeatedly, bound adds only π²/24 but stopping may be delayed beyond T_0(δ).

### Mechanism 2: Oracle Weight Tracking with Forced Exploration
- **Claim:** C-Tracking ensures cumulative arm pulls closely approximate oracle weights while maintaining minimum exploration.
- **Mechanism:** Compute empirical oracle weights ω(t) ∈ ω^*(μ̃(t)), project onto truncated simplex Δ_K^{ε_t} with ε_t ≈ t^(-1/2), track cumulative pulls. Guarantees: N_k(t) ≥ √t + K² - 2K (forced exploration), |N_k(t) - ∑_s ω_k(s)| ≤ O(K√t) (tracking error).
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 4] C-Tracking procedure details; [Page 23-24] Lemma 6 provides explicit bounds.
- **Break condition:** If tracking error grows faster than O(√t) or forced exploration fails, approximation of stopping rule by sampling rule breaks down.

### Mechanism 3: Connecting Stopping Rule to Sampling Rule via Information Accumulation
- **Claim:** Stopping condition max_i inf_λ ∑_k N_k(t)d(μ̂_k(t), λ_k) can be lower bounded (on good events) by cumulative oracle-weighted divergences.
- **Mechanism:** For TAS (single-answer): Accumulate ∑_{s≥√t} inf_{λ∈¬i_s} ∑_k ω_k(s)d(μ̃_k(s), λ_k) ≥ (t-√t-1)T^*(μ)⁻¹ - g(t). For S-TAS (multiple-answer): Require time T_μ for candidate answer set to collapse.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Page 6] Key idea analyzing stopping rule; [Page 7-8] T_μ characterization for S-TAS.
- **Break condition:** For TAS, if |i^*(μ)| > 1, argument fails. For S-TAS, if upper hemicontinuity fails or T_μ is very large, additional constant dominates.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pure Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits**
  - Why needed: Framework addresses fixed-confidence identification (best-arm, ε-best-arm, partition identification), not regret minimization.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why δ-correctness constraint (P(wrong answer) ≤ δ) differs fundamentally from regret bounds?

- **Concept: KL Divergence and Exponential Families**
  - Why needed: Lower bound T^*(μ)⁻¹ and stopping rule both use KL divergence; analysis exploits properties of canonical exponential families (convexity, natural parameters).
  - Quick check: For Bernoulli bandit with means p and q, what is d(p, q)? How does sub-Gaussianity relate to KL?

- **Concept: Asymptotic vs Non-Asymptotic Analysis**
  - Why needed: Prior work established lim_{δ→0} E[τ_δ]/log(1/δ) ≤ T^*(μ); this paper provides explicit E[τ_δ] bounds for fixed δ ∈ (0,1).
  - Quick check: Why does asymptotic result T^*(μ)log(1/δ) fail to capture finite-δ behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Initialization: Pull each arm once (K samples minimum)
  - Sampling Rule (TAS): Compute μ̂(t) → project to [μ_min, μ_max]^K → compute ω(t) ∈ ω^*(μ̃(t)) → C-Tracking selects arm A_{t+1}
  - Sampling Rule (S-TAS): Compute confidence region C_t → candidate answers I_t → select i_t via total order → compute ω(t) ∈ ω^*(μ̃(t), ¬i_t) → C-Tracking
  - Stopping Rule: Check if max_i inf_λ ∑_k N_k(t)d(μ̂_k(t), λ_k) ≥ β_{t,δ}
  - Recommendation: Return argmax_i inf_λ ∑_k N_k(t)d(μ̂_k(t), λ_k)

- **Critical path:** Oracle weight computation (solving sup_ω max_i inf_λ ∑ ω_k d(·, λ_k)) is computational bottleneck. For S-TAS, computing i_F(λ) for all λ in confidence region adds complexity.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Projection vs no projection: Projection ensures bounded divergences but adds only T_M to bound if skipped
  - TAS vs S-TAS: TAS simpler but fails when multiple correct answers exist; S-TAS handles multiple answers but introduces T_μ
  - Forced exploration rate (ε_t): Higher ε_t improves concentration but slows convergence to optimal weights

- **Failure signatures:**
  - TAS on multiple-answer problems: Expected sample complexity may be suboptimal
  - Non-sub-Gaussian arms: Concentration lemma fails; π²/24 bound may not hold
  - Unbounded means: Constants D and L become undefined

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validation on known instances: Implement TAS on 2-arm Gaussian BAI with known T^*(μ); verify E[τ_δ] matches theoretical bound
  2. Ablation on projection: Compare TAS with/without projection on heavy-tailed distributions; measure stopping time difference
  3. Multiple-answer stress test: Run S-TAS on ε-best-arm identification with varying ε; observe how T_μ and empirical stopping time scale with |i^*(μ)|

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can the problem-dependent constant $T_\mu$ be removed from the finite-confidence upper bound of Sticky Track-and-Stop?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors ask if it's possible to improve analysis by removing $T_\mu$
- **Why unresolved:** Current analysis requires $T_\mu$ to ensure candidate set collapses to correct answers
- **What evidence would resolve it:** New proof showing bound holds without $T_\mu$, or derivation showing modified optimistic sampling rule achieves tighter bound

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the existing gap between non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds for pure exploration be closed?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Conclusion states gap remains between lower and upper bounds in finite-confidence regime
- **Why unresolved:** While asymptotic optimality is well-understood, finite-confidence regime lacks complete characterization
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Establishing tight non-asymptotic lower bounds or deriving upper bounds that exactly match these lower bounds

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does selecting answers via an "optimistic" strategy rather than fixed total order improve finite-confidence guarantees of Sticky Track-and-Stop?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Authors conjecture improving analysis might require modifying sampling rule to use optimism
- **Why unresolved:** Current S-TAS uses pre-specified total order; paper doesn't analyze alternative selection strategies
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Analysis of modified S-TAS using optimistic selection, demonstrating removal of $T_\mu$ constant or otherwise tightening bound

## Limitations

- The problem-dependent constant $T_\mu$ in S-TAS bounds is not explicitly characterized in terms of problem geometry
- C-Tracking error bounds (O(√t)) are critical but not fully verified for all problem instances
- Analysis doesn't fully characterize probability that τ_δ significantly exceeds theoretical bound beyond π²/24 constant
- Gap remains between non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds for pure exploration

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Finite-confidence framework and decomposition of E[τ_δ] via good events - π²/24 bound on bad event probability is explicit and verifiable
- **Medium confidence:** Tracking error bounds for C-Tracking - Lemma 6 provides bounds but tightness depends on problem-specific oracle weight properties
- **Medium confidence:** Connection between sampling and stopping rules - analysis is rigorous but requires careful verification of upper hemicontinuity assumption for S-TAS

## Next Checks

1. Implement C-Tracking procedure and verify √t scaling of tracking error on synthetic problems with known oracle weights
2. Characterize T_μ empirically for S-TAS across problem instances with varying numbers of correct answers and geometric complexity of answer space
3. Test TAS on instances with multiple optimal answers to confirm predicted suboptimality and unbounded asymptotic ratio
