# KANMixer: Can KAN Serve as a New Modeling Core for Long-term Time Series Forecasting?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01575
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes KANMixer, a KAN-based architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 long-term time series forecasting configurations.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) can effectively serve as the modeling core for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). The authors propose KANMixer, a concise architecture that leverages KAN's adaptive basis functions through a multi-scale mixing backbone without external modules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 configurations, outperforming more complex models. Systematic ablation studies reveal that KAN's adaptive plasticity in basis functions is the key driver of its superior performance, with the KAN-based prediction head being particularly critical.

## Method Summary
KANMixer employs a channel-independent approach where each variable is processed separately through a multi-scale module that applies average pooling to generate coarse-scale versions. These are then fused through N=3 temporal mixing blocks using fine-to-coarse fusion with KAN layers. The model concludes with a KAN-based prediction head that maps the fused features to the future horizon. The architecture is trained with Adam optimizer (lr=0.01), batch size=32, and MSE loss, with results averaged over 5 runs. B-spline basis functions are used for KAN layers, with 3 layers identified as optimal.

## Key Results
- KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 forecasting configurations across seven benchmark datasets
- The KAN-based prediction head is identified as the single most critical component for performance
- KAN's adaptive basis functions provide superior accuracy compared to fixed activation functions in MLPs
- KAN's adaptive plasticity eliminates the need for explicit structural priors like frequency decomposition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** KAN's adaptive basis functions provide superior forecasting accuracy by enabling granular, local modulation of nonlinearities compared to the fixed activation functions in MLPs.
- **Mechanism:** Standard MLPs rely on fixed activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) on nodes, applying the same transformation regardless of the input distribution. KAN utilizes learnable spline-based functions (specifically B-splines) on the network edges. This allows the model to dynamically adjust the shape of the transformation to fit the local "curvature" of the time-series data, resulting in a more flexible function approximation with potentially fewer parameters.
- **Core assumption:** The underlying mapping from historical to future time-series values benefits significantly from high-frequency, local adaptability that standard linear or fixed-nonlinear layers cannot efficiently capture.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] Mentions KAN features "adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation of nonlinearities." [section] "Impact of Basis Function Choice on KAN Performance" (Figure 3) shows B-spline KAN consistently outperforming MLP and other basis types across various forecast lengths.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** KAN architectures implicitly learn hierarchical temporal features, rendering explicit structural priors (like frequency decomposition) not only unnecessary but potentially detrimental to performance.
- **Mechanism:** Traditional MLP-based models often require explicit decomposition (trend vs. seasonality) to overcome the limitations of fixed activations. The paper finds that KAN's high plasticity allows it to learn these decompositions end-to-end. Adding hard-coded decomposition modules forces a structural prior that conflicts with the adaptive representations KAN is trying to learn, effectively constraining its "search space."
- **Core assumption:** KAN's adaptive capacity is sufficient to disentangle complex temporal dynamics (trend, seasonality) without manual signal processing intervention.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section] "Impact of Structural Priors on KAN Performance" (Table 5) shows that applying Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or Moving Average (MA) decomposition improves MLP performance but degrades KAN performance.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The prediction head is the most critical component for leveraging KAN's advantages in LTSF, more so than the mixing or embedding layers.
- **Mechanism:** The final prediction head maps deep latent features to the multi-step forecast horizon. The authors argue this is the most complex function approximation step. Replacing the KAN head with an MLP head removes the adaptive non-linearity precisely where the mapping is most intricate, leading to significant accuracy loss.
- **Core assumption:** The mapping from latent feature space to the future time horizon contains non-linearities that are harder to approximate with fixed linear+activation stacks than with spline functions.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section] "Component-wise Ablation of KAN Modules" (Table 3) identifies that removing the KAN-based prediction head causes the largest performance drop compared to removing KAN from mixing or FFN modules.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) vs. MLP**
  - **Why needed here:** The core of the paper is replacing MLPs with KAN. You must understand that MLPs learn weights on edges and apply fixed activations on nodes, whereas KANs learn univariate functions (typically splines) on edges and perform simple summation on nodes.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a spline-based edge function might capture a sudden spike in electricity demand better than a standard ReLU activation?

- **Concept: Structural Priors in Time Series (Decomposition)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper challenges the standard practice of decomposing time series (into trend/seasonality) before feeding them into the model. Understanding this helps explain why KANMixer uses a "minimalistic" design.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might forcing a model to look at "Trend" and "Seasonality" separately hurt a model that is capable of learning complex, adaptive combinations of these features itself?

- **Concept: Multi-Scale Mixing**
  - **Why needed here:** While KANMixer rejects decomposition, it embraces multi-scale processing (pooling) to capture features at different resolutions.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is looking at a time series at both a "fine" resolution (hourly) and a "coarse" resolution (daily average) simultaneously beneficial for long-term forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Input -> Average Pooling (Multi-Scale) -> KAN-based Fusion (Fine-to-Coarse) -> KAN Prediction Head -> Output

- **Critical path:** Raw Input → Average Pooling (Multi-Scale) → KAN-based Fusion (Fine-to-Coarse) → **KAN Prediction Head** → Output

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Basis Function Choice: B-splines provide the best accuracy but are slow (lack optimized CUDA kernels). Chebyshev is faster but less stable for long horizons.
  - Depth: 3 layers is the "sweet spot." Deeper KANs (4+) cause training instability and exploding gradients; shallower networks underfit.
  - Prior Injection: Do not inject external decomposition (DFT/FFT) into KAN; it degrades performance.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Exploding Gradients: If you stack >3 KAN layers without tuning, training diverges.
  - Slow Training: B-spline KAN trains ~3x slower than equivalent MLPs due to software optimization lag, not just theoretical FLOPs.
  - Performance Drop: If you replace the final head with a Linear/MLP layer, MSE increases significantly (approx +3-4% on ETTh1).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (MLP vs. KAN Head): Build a simple linear backbone and swap the prediction head between a standard Linear layer and a KAN layer on the ETTh1 dataset. Observe the MSE gap.
  2. Prior Ablation: Train KANMixer on raw data vs. data pre-processed with Moving Average decomposition. Confirm that the decomposed version performs worse for KAN (but better for MLP).
  3. Depth Scaling: Train KANMixer with 2, 3, and 4 layers on the Weather dataset to verify the "instability" at depth 4 and performance saturation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Why do explicit structural priors like frequency decomposition improve MLP performance but degrade KAN performance in LTSF tasks?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note the "unexpected result" in the "Impact of Structural Priors" section, hypothesizing that priors limit KAN's adaptive capability.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper provides empirical evidence of the degradation but lacks a theoretical explanation for why KAN resists these manually designed inductive biases.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A theoretical analysis or visualization of feature representations showing conflicts between fixed decomposition and KAN's adaptive spline basis functions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can specialized computational kernels or model pruning effectively mitigate the training overhead and memory demands of KAN-based models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Future Work" explicitly identifies addressing computational overhead via optimized kernels and compression as a necessary next step.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation relies on standard libraries, causing KAN to train nearly 2x slower than MLPs despite similar theoretical MACs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of custom CUDA kernels for B-spline operations that achieve training speeds comparable to optimized linear algebra routines.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Is the KAN-based prediction head critical for all LTSF architectures, or is its importance specific to the KANMixer backbone?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The ablation studies identify the prediction head as the "single most critical driver of performance," leading the authors to suggest prioritizing it in future designs.
- **Why unresolved:** The finding is based solely on component-wise ablation within the KANMixer architecture.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Integrating a KAN-based prediction head into distinct architectures (e.g., Transformers, RNNs) and observing consistent performance gains.

## Limitations

- Computational cost: B-spline KAN training is nearly 3x slower than equivalent MLPs due to lack of optimized CUDA kernels
- Decomposition generalization: The finding that structural priors hurt KAN is based only on basic DFT/MA decomposition; more sophisticated priors may yield different results
- Depth sensitivity: Optimal KAN depth is dataset-dependent, with instability occurring beyond 3 layers in the tested configurations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** KAN-based prediction head is critical for performance (supported by systematic ablation with clear MSE degradation when replaced)
- **Medium Confidence:** KAN outperforms MLP across diverse benchmarks (16/28 configurations suggest robustness, but hyperparameter tuning could influence results)
- **Medium Confidence:** Adaptive basis functions drive performance (supported by basis function ablation showing B-splines > Chebyshev/Fourier, but underlying mechanism needs further validation)
- **Low Confidence:** Structural priors are detrimental to KAN (based on limited decomposition types; more sophisticated priors not tested)

## Next Checks

1. **Computational Profiling:** Measure actual training time differences between B-spline KAN and MLP on identical hardware, isolating software overhead from algorithmic complexity
2. **Prior Generalization:** Test KANMixer with domain-specific decomposition methods (e.g., wavelet transforms for financial data, Fourier for periodic signals) beyond the basic DFT/MA tested
3. **Stability Boundary:** Systematically vary KAN layer depth across all datasets to map the exact instability threshold and identify conditions where deeper KANs might be viable
