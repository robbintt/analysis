# Space-Filling Regularization for Robust and Interpretable Nonlinear State Space Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07792
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07792
- Reference count: 5
- Improves robustness and interpretability of nonlinear state space models via space-filling regularization, achieving RMSE of 0.981 × 10⁻⁵ m on Bouc-Wen benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of poor state space coverage during training of nonlinear state space models, which degrades interpretability and robustness. The authors propose a space-filling regularization method that penalizes undesirable data distributions in the state space using two metrics: covered volume and Kullback-Leibler divergence. The method is demonstrated on local affine state space models (LMSSN) and evaluated on a benchmark Bouc-Wen hysteretic system. Results show improved model interpretability, increased robustness, and reduced training time. On the benchmark, the regularized model achieved an RMSE of 0.981 × 10⁻⁵ m, outperforming unregularized models that exhibited instability.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a space-filling regularization technique for Local Model State Space Networks (LMSSN) to prevent state trajectory deformation during training. The approach uses two metrics: mean minimum distance to grid points (ψ_p) and convex hull volume. The regularization penalizes models where the state trajectory compresses toward lower-dimensional manifolds, forcing better coverage of the state space. The method is implemented by adding a regularization term to the training objective that encourages the state distribution to match a target space-filling metric derived from the initial balanced linear realization. This is combined with the LOLIMOT incremental learning algorithm for building local affine models.

## Key Results
- Regularized model achieved RMSE of 0.981 × 10⁻⁵ m on Bouc-Wen test set
- Unregularized models exhibited instability during training, with poles leaving unit circle
- Regularization enabled processing training data with more local models (7 vs 4), improving performance
- Training time reduced compared to unregularized approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The regularization works by preventing the state trajectory from collapsing onto lower-dimensional manifolds during optimization. Without regularization, the training process can inadvertently compress the trajectory to fit the data better, which improves training error but hurts interpretability and robustness. The space-filling metrics detect this compression and penalize it, forcing the model to maintain good coverage of the state space. This leads to more stable local models with poles remaining inside the unit circle, better generalization to unseen data, and improved interpretability since the state space representation remains meaningful throughout training.

## Foundational Learning
- **State Space Representation**: Fundamental framework for dynamic systems where future states depend on current states and inputs; needed to understand how nonlinear models generalize
  - Quick check: Verify you can write a basic state space model and identify state, input, and output variables
- **LOLIMOT Algorithm**: Incremental learning method that builds local models by axis-orthogonal splitting; needed to understand how local affine models are constructed
  - Quick check: Confirm you understand how LOLIMOT decides where to split and how local validity functions work
- **Regularization in Neural Networks**: General technique for preventing overfitting by adding penalty terms; needed to see how space-filling fits into broader ML context
  - Quick check: Ensure you can explain why L2 regularization prevents overfitting
- **Kullback-Leibler Divergence**: Measure of difference between probability distributions; needed to understand one of the space-filling metrics
  - Quick check: Verify you can compute KLD between two simple distributions
- **Convex Hull Volume**: Geometric measure of the volume spanned by a set of points; needed to understand the alternative space-filling metric
  - Quick check: Confirm you can compute convex hull for a set of 2D points

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
BLA Initialization -> LOLIMOT Incremental Learning -> Space-Filling Regularization -> Local Affine Models

**Critical Path:**
The most critical sequence is BLA initialization → balanced realization → unit-cube scaling → LOLIMOT training with regularization. This initialization ensures the state space starts with good coverage, which the regularization then maintains throughout training.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The main tradeoff is between fitting accuracy and space-filling. Stronger regularization (higher λ) maintains better state space coverage but may increase training error. The authors chose λ=10³ based on empirical testing. Another tradeoff is between model complexity (number of local models) and regularization strength.

**Failure Signatures:**
Primary failure mode is local model instability, where poles leave the unit circle during training. This manifests as divergent test predictions even when training error is low. Secondary failure is LOLIMOT collapse, where validation error increases mid-training and later splits perform worse than earlier ones. Both failures are mitigated by space-filling regularization.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement ψ_p metric: define uniform grid (125 points in unit cube), compute mean of min Euclidean distances from grid points to nearest state trajectory points
2. Train unregularized LMSSN baseline on Bouc-Wen data, track local model stability (|μ_i| < 1) and number of splits achieved
3. Add space-filling regularization with ψ_p,Target=0.25 and λ=10³, compare RMSE and stability to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1:** Does space-filling enforcement guarantee stable extrapolation behavior for local model state space networks?
- Based on: The conclusion explicitly identifies focus on "stable extrapolation behavior due to space-filling enforcement" as primary future research
- Why unresolved: While regularization prevents instability on test data (interpolation), it doesn't verify local models remain stable when state trajectory ventures outside training distribution
- Evidence needed: Theoretical proof or empirical validation using excitation signals that drive system into untrained regions to verify local pole stability

**Open Question 2:** Can the proposed regularization strategy be effectively transferred to generic black-box neural state space models?
- Based on: Introduction notes trajectory deformation "can hardly be investigated for deep neural state space models" where all weights are trainable, yet method evaluated only on LMSSN
- Why unresolved: Effectiveness relies on interaction between data distribution and local validity functions, which differs in fully connected neural networks or RNNs
- Evidence needed: Application of convex hull volume or KLD penalty to deep neural state space architecture (neural ODEs or RNNs) to observe if similar benefits occur

**Open Question 3:** Is there an automated, theoretically grounded method for selecting the target space-filling value (ψ_p,Target)?
- Based on: Authors note "Desired Amount" approach requires target value known a priori, set based on initial balanced linear realization
- Why unresolved: Reliance on initial linear model's distribution acts as heuristic; unclear how to determine optimal target if BLA unavailable or inappropriate
- Evidence needed: Development of adaptive algorithm or theoretical criterion that defines optimal ψ_p,Target independent of BLA initialization

## Limitations
- Implementation requires specific LOLIMOT split-adaption algorithm details not provided
- BLA frequency-domain identification and balanced realization details are unspecified
- BFGS convergence hyperparameters (loss tolerance, gradient tolerance, line search settings) not given

## Confidence
**High:** The space-filling regularization concept, metrics (ψ_p, CHV, KLD), and overall LOLIMOT framework are clearly specified and reproducible.
**Medium:** Implementation of metrics is described but exact grid definition and KDE parameters are not given; regularization objective form is clear but BFGS settings are missing.
**Low:** Exact LOLIMOT adaptation and BLA initialization details are not provided.

## Next Checks
1. Verify space-filling metrics (ψ_p, CHV, KLD) detect trajectory compression during optimization and that regularization with λ=10³ keeps ψ_p near target of 0.25
2. Confirm local model stability (|μ_i| < 1) is maintained throughout training and that more local models (7 vs 4) are used compared to unregularized baseline
3. Compare RMSE on Bouc-Wen test set to reported 0.981 × 10⁻⁵ m and check that test error doesn't diverge for regularized model
