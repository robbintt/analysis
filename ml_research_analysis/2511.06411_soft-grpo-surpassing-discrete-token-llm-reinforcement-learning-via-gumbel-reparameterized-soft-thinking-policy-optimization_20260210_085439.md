# SofT-GRPO: Surpassing Discrete-Token LLM Reinforcement Learning via Gumbel-Reparameterized Soft-Thinking Policy Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.06411
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06411
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking models to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% average accuracy) and substantially improve on Pass@32 (+2.19% average accuracy)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SofT-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm designed to improve large language model reasoning under the soft-thinking paradigm. Unlike traditional discrete-token reasoning, soft-thinking uses continuous weighted token embeddings, but applying standard reinforcement learning methods to it is challenging due to the lack of stochasticity and gradient signals. SofT-GRPO injects Gumbel noise into token probabilities and uses the Gumbel-Softmax technique to maintain valid soft tokens, while employing Gumbel reparameterization to enable accurate credit assignment during policy updates. Experiments on LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters show that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking models to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% average accuracy) and substantially improve on Pass@32 (+2.19% average accuracy), demonstrating that SofT-GRPO effectively enhances soft-thinking reasoning ability beyond conventional methods.

## Method Summary
SofT-GRPO addresses the challenge of applying reinforcement learning to soft-thinking (continuous weighted token embeddings) by introducing Gumbel noise and Gumbel-Softmax to maintain valid soft tokens. The method employs Gumbel reparameterization to enable accurate credit assignment during policy updates. By injecting stochasticity into the continuous token probabilities, SofT-GRPO makes the soft-thinking reasoning process differentiable and trainable via policy gradient methods, overcoming the limitations of standard GRPO which is designed for discrete token generation.

## Key Results
- SofT-GRPO slightly outperforms discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% average accuracy)
- SofT-GRPO substantially improves Pass@32 performance (+2.19% average accuracy)
- Improvements observed across LLMs from 1.5B to 7B parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SofT-GRPO works by introducing Gumbel noise into token probabilities and using Gumbel-Softmax to maintain valid soft tokens. This approach enables the application of reinforcement learning to continuous reasoning by providing the necessary stochasticity and gradient signals that are absent in standard soft-thinking. The Gumbel reparameterization technique allows for accurate credit assignment during policy updates, which is crucial for effective learning in continuous action spaces.

## Foundational Learning

**Soft-thinking reasoning**: Uses continuous weighted token embeddings instead of discrete tokens. Why needed: Enables more nuanced and graded reasoning processes. Quick check: Verify the model can handle continuous token representations.

**Gumbel-Softmax technique**: Allows sampling from categorical distributions in a differentiable way. Why needed: Makes the discrete token selection process differentiable for backpropagation. Quick check: Confirm gradients can flow through the Gumbel-Softmax operation.

**Gumbel reparameterization**: A method for gradient estimation in stochastic computation graphs. Why needed: Enables accurate credit assignment in reinforcement learning with continuous actions. Quick check: Validate that policy gradients are correctly computed.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Soft tokens -> Gumbel noise injection -> Gumbel-Softmax sampling -> Policy gradient computation -> Model update

**Critical path**: Token probability generation -> Gumbel noise injection -> Soft token sampling -> Reward calculation -> Gradient computation -> Parameter update

**Design tradeoffs**: Continuous vs discrete token representation (nuance vs simplicity), Gumbel noise injection (stochasticity vs determinism), Gumbel-Softmax approximation (differentiability vs exactness)

**Failure signatures**: Vanishing gradients due to improper temperature settings in Gumbel-Softmax, poor credit assignment from insufficient Gumbel noise, overfitting to specific reward structures

**First experiments**: 1) Verify soft token generation and Gumbel noise injection, 2) Test Gumbel-Softmax sampling with different temperature parameters, 3) Validate policy gradient computation with synthetic rewards

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Modest absolute improvements (Pass@1 +0.13%, Pass@32 +2.19%) raise questions about practical significance
- Limited experimental scope across reasoning tasks and model sizes
- Theoretical justification for Gumbel reparameterization's effectiveness in soft-thinking remains informal
- Additional hyperparameters and approximations from Gumbel-Softmax may affect stability and reproducibility

## Next Checks

1. Test SofT-GRPO on a wider range of reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH, and coding tasks) to assess generalizability
2. Compare SofT-GRPO against other continuous reasoning methods or hybrid discrete-continuous approaches to establish relative effectiveness
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of Gumbel reparameterization and noise injection on final performance and training stability
