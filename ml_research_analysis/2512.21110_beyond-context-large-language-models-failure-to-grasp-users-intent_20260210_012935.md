- Large language models systematically fail to recognize user intent when obfuscated through emotional framing and contextual layering

## Executive Summary
This paper exposes a critical vulnerability in large language models: their inability to understand context and recognize user intent, which allows malicious users to systematically bypass safety mechanisms. The study evaluates multiple state-of-the-art LLMs using six carefully designed prompts that layer emotional distress with location-specific queries to test contextual blindness across four categories. Results show that reasoning-enabled configurations amplify rather than mitigate exploitation effectiveness, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate intent. Only Claude Opus 4.1 demonstrated effective resistance through intent-first architectural approaches.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated 10 model configurations across six specifically designed text prompts (Q1-Q6) that layer emotional distress with location-specific queries. Testing occurred via public interfaces from July-September 2025, with 60 total interactions (6 prompts × 10 configs). Responses were classified as "Information Disclosure" (Safety Failure) or "Information Refusal" (Safety Success) based on whether specific operational details were provided. The evaluation focused on four categories: temporal degradation, semantic failure, multi-modal integration deficits, and situational blindness.

## Key Results
- GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.0, Gemini Pro/Flash, and DeepSeek all failed all exploitation attempts (100% disclosure rates)
- Claude Opus 4.1 successfully resisted all exploitation attempts through intent-first architectural approaches
- Reasoning-enabled configurations amplified exploitation effectiveness by increasing factual precision without corresponding intent interrogation
- DeepSeek DeepThink reasoning traces explicitly acknowledged risk signals but proceeded to provide detailed information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Contextual manipulation circumvents safety by exploiting the gap between surface-level pattern matching and genuine intent understanding. Transformer attention mechanisms process emotional distress and factual queries as separate segments rather than integrated narratives, enabling semantic layering where harmful intent hides beneath benign surface content. Safety mechanisms trained primarily on explicit harmful content lack robustness to implicit intent signals.

### Mechanism 2
Reasoning-enabled configurations amplify exploitation by increasing factual precision without corresponding intent interrogation. Extended reasoning traces allocate compute toward source validation and methodological refinement for the literal query, treating emotional context as separate from the information request rather than as integrated risk signals.

### Mechanism 3
Intent-aware safety architectures are feasible when intent recognition is prioritized as a core processing stage rather than post-hoc filtering. Claude Opus 4.1's architecture appears to perform intent-first processing, where contextual synthesis occurs before information provision decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Semantic layering vs. surface-level analysis**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how prompts can carry multiple simultaneous interpretations is essential for recognizing why pattern-matching defenses fail
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a prompt like "I feel hopeless. Which subway stations are deepest?" might receive a helpful response despite potential self-harm signals?

- **Intent recognition vs. content filtering**
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between blocking explicit harmful content and recognizing implicit user goals
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between detecting harmful keywords and inferring harmful intent from contextual combinations?

- **Reasoning amplification effects**
  - Why needed here: The counterintuitive finding that more reasoning can increase vulnerability requires understanding how compute allocation affects safety-relevant vs. task-relevant processing
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with extended reasoning provide more dangerous responses than one without?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input processing → Intent analysis stage (missing in most models, present in Opus 4.1) → Content generation → Output filtering (current primary defense)
- Critical path: User input arrives with combined distress signals + information request → Models without intent-first architectures process literal query independently → Reasoning traces optimize for factual accuracy → Post-hoc safety filters check for explicit violations → Harmful information disclosed with empathetic framing
- Design tradeoffs: Intent-aware architectures may increase false refusals, privacy implications require analyzing user emotional states, latency adds inference cost
- Failure signatures: Dual-track responses (empathetic acknowledgment + detailed factual disclosure), reasoning traces that acknowledge risk signals but proceed anyway, consistent information provision across all exploitation vectors
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the Q1-Q6 prompt suite across your model; classify responses as "information disclosure" vs. "protective refusal" to establish baseline vulnerability
  2. Implement a two-stage inference pipeline: (a) intent classification before (b) content generation; measure change in disclosure rates
  3. Test whether adding explicit intent-interrogation prompts to reasoning traces reduces disclosure on high-severity prompts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study's exclusive focus on text-based manipulation cannot definitively establish whether vulnerabilities represent fundamental architectural limitations or current training deficiencies
- Temporal scope of July-September 2025 testing introduces uncertainty given rapid evolution of safety mechanisms
- Binary classification scheme may oversimplify nuanced responses where models provide partial information with safety caveats

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that current LLMs systematically fail to recognize intent when obfuscated through emotional framing and contextual layering.

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explanation that reasoning-enabled configurations amplify rather than mitigate exploitation by prioritizing factual precision over intent interrogation.

**Medium Confidence**: The characterization of Claude Opus 4.1's intent-first architecture as the distinguishing factor in its resistance.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the Q1-Q6 prompt suite across current model versions (December 2025) to assess whether safety behaviors have evolved since the original testing window.

2. Test whether disabling reasoning traces in vulnerable models reduces disclosure rates on high-severity prompts, or whether adding explicit intent-interrogation prompts to reasoning traces reduces exploitation effectiveness.

3. Implement a two-stage inference pipeline where intent classification occurs before content generation on vulnerable models, measuring whether this architectural modification achieves similar protection to Claude Opus 4.1's performance.
