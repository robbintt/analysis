# Beware of Reasoning Overconfidence: Pitfalls in the Reasoning Process for Multi-solution Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.01725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01725
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Short-CoT prompts exhibit pronounced reasoning overconfidence on multi-solution tasks, while Long-CoT reduces overconfidence through iterative exploration and self-reflection.

## Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit reasoning overconfidence when tackling multi-solution tasks, reporting high confidence despite incomplete solution sets. This paper introduces MuSoBench, a benchmark suite containing TimeTabling and SubsetSum tasks, designed to systematically evaluate reasoning completeness and confidence calibration. The study reveals that conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting leads to pronounced overconfidence, with high confidence but low recall. In contrast, long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approaches, which encourage iterative exploration and reflection, significantly reduce overconfidence and improve both recall and precision. The authors propose the cognitive-rigidity hypothesis, supported by attention-entropy analysis, suggesting that overconfidence stems from premature convergence on narrow reasoning paths. These findings highlight the need for more exploratory reasoning paradigms to improve LLM reliability in multi-solution scenarios.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates reasoning overconfidence using MuSoBench, a benchmark with two multi-solution tasks: TimeTabling (course scheduling) and SubsetSum (finding subsets summing to target). Models are tested using both Short-CoT (base instruction + "Think step by step") and Long-CoT (iteratively trained reasoning models) paradigms. Verbalized confidence (0-100 scale) is elicited after solution generation. Evaluation metrics include Recall (primary), Precision, Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and behavioral metrics (CSR, ESC, NSD). The study analyzes attention entropy across transformer layers to test the cognitive-rigidity hypothesis and examines the relationship between reasoning length and confidence calibration.

## Key Results
- Short-CoT models exhibit high confidence (>80%) with low recall (<20%) on multi-solution tasks, demonstrating pronounced reasoning overconfidence.
- Long-CoT approaches reduce overconfidence through iterative exploration, achieving higher recall and lower ECE compared to Short-CoT.
- Attention entropy analysis shows Short-CoT has lower entropy in core reasoning layers, suggesting cognitive rigidity and premature convergence on narrow solution paths.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cognitive Rigidity Causes Premature Convergence
- Claim: Short-CoT reasoning locks onto narrow reasoning paths early, producing high confidence with incomplete coverage.
- Mechanism: In core reasoning layers (approximately layers 15-30), Short-CoT exhibits lower attention entropy than Long-CoT. This reduced entropy signals narrowly focused attention that restricts exploratory reasoning, causing the model to settle on a partial solution set and stop searching. The model then terminates with higher entropy in deep layers, reflecting late-stage uncertainty without corrective exploration.
- Core assumption: Attention entropy serves as a valid proxy for reasoning path diversity and exploration breadth.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "We propose the cognitive-rigidity hypothesis, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view." [section] Figure 7 and Section 6 describe the three-phase entropy pattern.

### Mechanism 2: Reflection Steps Expand Solution Coverage and Lower Confidence
- Claim: Inserting reflection steps during reasoning increases recall and reduces overconfidence by forcing reconsideration of completeness.
- Mechanism: Reflection checkpoints interrupt premature termination, prompting the model to revisit earlier conclusions, correct errors, and discover new solutions. Empirically, more reflection rounds raise recall while lowering reported confidence, improving calibration.
- Core assumption: Reflection prompts effectively trigger broader search rather than mere repetition of existing reasoning.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Long-CoT approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection." [section] Figure 6(a) shows that as reflection time increases, recall improves and overconfidence decreases significantly.

### Mechanism 3: Reasoning Length Calibrates Confidence via Inference-Time Scaling
- Claim: Longer reasoning traces correlate with more moderate confidence estimates, aligning confidence with actual performance.
- Mechanism: Extended chain-of-thought increases inference computation, enabling more exhaustive search. A strong negative correlation emerges between reasoning length and final confidence: models that "think longer" report lower confidence, improving Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
- Core assumption: Verbalized confidence (0-100 scale) reflects internal probability estimates and is comparable across reasoning paradigms.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection." [section] Figure 5(a) demonstrates a strong negative correlation between reasoning length and confidence.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
  - Why needed here: ECE quantifies the gap between reported confidence and realized performance (recall). Understanding ECE is essential to diagnose and compare overconfidence across paradigms.
  - Quick check question: If a model reports 90% confidence but achieves 20% recall on multi-solution tasks, is it overconfident? (Yes—ECE would be high.)

- Concept: Recall vs. Precision in Multi-Solution Tasks
  - Why needed here: Multi-solution tasks prioritize completeness (recall) over correctness of individual items (precision). Using F1 would obscure the exploration shortfall this paper isolates.
  - Quick check question: A model finds 3 correct solutions out of 10 ground-truth solutions and generates no incorrect solutions. What is its recall? (30%.)

- Concept: Attention Entropy as Exploration Proxy
  - Why needed here: The paper uses layer-wise attention entropy to operationalize cognitive rigidity. Higher entropy in core layers suggests broader attention over possible reasoning paths.
  - Quick check question: In a transformer, would uniformly distributed attention weights yield higher or lower entropy than sharply peaked attention on a few tokens? (Higher entropy.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MuSoBench (TimeTabling, SubsetSum) -> Reasoning paradigms (Short-CoT vs Long-CoT) -> Confidence elicitation (0-100 scale) -> Evaluation metrics (Recall, Precision, ECE, CSR/ESC/NSD)
- Critical path: 1) Select model and paradigm 2) Run inference on MuSoBench instances 3) Extract solution set and verbalized confidence 4) Compute recall and ECE; analyze confidence-recall distributions
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Short-CoT: Faster, lower token cost, but high ECE (>78% in experiments) and low recall
  - Long-CoT: Higher token cost, significantly lower ECE (18-28% reduction) and higher recall, but open-source models still show ROC (>56% ECE)
  - Parallel exploration (self-consistency with voting): Further improves recall and calibration but requires n=32 paths, increasing compute substantially
- Failure signatures: High confidence (>80%) with low recall (<20%) indicates classic reasoning overconfidence; extremely low Error Correction Rate and New Solution Discovery Rate signal cognitive rigidity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Short-CoT vs. Long-CoT calibration on a subset of MuSoBench to validate the confidence-recall distribution shift
  2. Ablate reflection steps in Long-CoT by inserting control tokens at scheduled checkpoints; measure recall and confidence at each checkpoint
  3. Test the simple exploratory prompt ("Wait, there may be other solutions") on Short-CoT; compare recall and ECE before and after

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does attention entropy causally determine reasoning overconfidence, or is it merely a correlational byproduct of the Long-CoT process?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 6 states that attention-entropy analysis offers only "preliminary support" for the cognitive-rigidity hypothesis.
- Why unresolved: The paper observes a correlation between entropy phases and overconfidence but does not perform interventional studies to prove that "cognitive rigidity" is the root cause rather than a side effect of the training method.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies or interventions that manipulate attention heads to forcibly sustain high entropy in core reasoning layers to see if it independently reduces overconfidence without Long-CoT prompting.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific training interventions can effectively mitigate reasoning overconfidence in open-source models, which remain poorly calibrated even with Long-CoT?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.1 concludes that while Long-CoT helps, "open-source models continue to exhibit pronounced ROC... even after Long-CoT prompting," and explicitly states they "still need further improvement."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that current Long-CoT fine-tuning is insufficient for open-source models but does not propose or test specific modifications to the training data or architecture to close this performance gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study testing specialized fine-tuning objectives on open-source models to achieve calibration levels comparable to GPT models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does reasoning overconfidence manifest in tasks with implicit constraints compared to the explicit, algorithmic constraints used in MuSoBench?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges in Section 2.3 that MuSoBench relies on TimeTabling and SubsetSum, which are "tightly constrained," and Appendix A.4 adds only a brief test on creative generation.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "cognitive rigidity" failure mode is universal or dependent on the nature of the search space.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the MuSoBench evaluation framework to complex domains like code generation or document summarization.

## Limitations

- The cognitive-rigidity hypothesis relies heavily on attention-entropy as a proxy for reasoning diversity, but this connection is only preliminarily supported and not validated across multiple architectures or domains.
- Long-CoT reflection mechanisms are underspecified in implementation details, particularly the control-token pausing mechanism and exact prompt formulations for non-Qwen models.
- The verbalized confidence scale (0-100) assumes linear comparability across models and paradigms, but calibration may be inherently subjective and context-dependent.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The empirical demonstration that Short-CoT exhibits pronounced overconfidence (high confidence with low recall) and that Long-CoT reduces this effect through iterative exploration. The MuSoBench benchmark design and evaluation metrics are clearly specified.
- Medium confidence: The proposed cognitive-rigidity hypothesis linking attention entropy to reasoning path diversity. While the entropy patterns are observed, the causal interpretation requires further validation.
- Medium confidence: The inference-time scaling claim that longer reasoning traces improve calibration. The negative correlation between reasoning length and confidence is demonstrated, but whether this reflects better exploration versus mere verbosity remains unclear.

## Next Checks

1. Validate the attention-entropy exploration hypothesis on a different model architecture (e.g., Llama or Mistral) and a structurally different task domain (e.g., code generation or logical deduction) to test generalizability of the cognitive-rigidity mechanism.
2. Conduct ablation studies on reflection checkpoints by varying the frequency and content of reflection prompts in Long-CoT to quantify the marginal contribution of each reflection step to recall improvement and overconfidence reduction.
3. Test whether external exploration cues ("Wait, there may be other solutions") can break cognitive rigidity in Short-CoT without full Long-CoT implementation, providing a lower-cost intervention to improve calibration.
