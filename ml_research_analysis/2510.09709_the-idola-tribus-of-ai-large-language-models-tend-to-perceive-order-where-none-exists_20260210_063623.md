# The Idola Tribus of AI: Large Language Models tend to perceive order where none exists

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09709
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09709
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs frequently generate incorrect explanations for randomly generated number sequences, perceiving patterns where none exist.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit "Idola Tribus" - the tendency to perceive order where none exists. Testing models on number sequences ranging from simple arithmetic and geometric series to randomly generated ones, the researchers found that while LLMs accurately identify patterns in ordered sequences, they frequently generate incorrect explanations for random series. This tendency was observed across all tested models, including advanced models with chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities like GPT-4.1, OpenAI o3, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. The study concludes that LLMs have a strong bias toward finding patterns, even when none exist, highlighting a critical limitation in their logical reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The study generated 724 number series across 8 categories (arithmetic, geometric, difference, quasi-variants, random-increasing, random) and presented 5-term sequences to five LLMs (GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking, Llama 3.3) using two prompt variants: standard (force explanation) and random-allowing (may declare randomness). Responses were evaluated using o3 as an "LLM-as-a-judge" with 4-option classification (correct-aligned, correct-not-aligned, incorrect, random-statement). Success rates were calculated based on options 1+2 always valid and option 4 valid for quasi/random categories.

## Key Results
- Models achieved ~99% success rates on ordered series but only 5-28% on random series with standard prompts
- Success rates for random series improved to 78% average with random-allowing prompt vs 26.8% originally
- Even o3, when evaluating its own responses, judged only 52/100 random-series patterns as valid while still outputting them
- Quasi-ordered series showed intermediate success rates (41-42%), suggesting partial patterns trigger strongest overfitting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Training Distribution Induces Pattern-Completion Priors
- Claim: LLMs default to generating pattern explanations because training data disproportionately contains coherent, rule-governed sequences rather than noise.
- Mechanism: The model's learned distribution assigns higher probability to outputs that "look like" valid explanations regardless of whether they fit the input data.
- Core assumption: The tendency stems from training distribution skew rather than architectural limitations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers"; [section 5] "plausible that this bias stems from an implicit compulsion in LLMs to always provide an answer"

### Mechanism 2: Instruction-Following Overrides Internal Uncertainty
- Claim: Models generate false patterns even when their internal evaluation mechanism flags them as invalid, due to instruction-following pressure.
- Mechanism: The paper's o3 self-evaluation test showed that o3 judged its own generated patterns as valid in only 52/100 random-series cases—yet it still output them.
- Core assumption: The disconnect occurs at the integration layer between reasoning and output generation.
- Evidence anchors: [section 5] "o3 judged its own identified regularities as valid in only 52 out of 100 cases"; "the o3 model generated false patterns even in cases where it itself recognized them as incorrect"

### Mechanism 3: Prompting Can Partially Counteract Pattern Bias
- Claim: Explicitly allowing "random" as a valid response shifts model behavior, suggesting the bias is partly driven by implicit task framing.
- Mechanism: The "random-allowing" prompt increased random-series identification rates from 5-28% to 30-93% depending on model.
- Core assumption: Models can recognize randomness when given explicit permission, but default to pattern-finding mode without it.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4, Table 3] Random-series explanation rates jump significantly with modified prompt; [section 4, Table 4] Success rates improved to 78% average with random-allowing prompt

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning in Pattern Recognition
  - Why needed here: The paper tests inductive capability (inferring rules from limited data) rather than deductive reasoning. Understanding this distinction is essential to interpret why "thinking" models still fail—they may excel at deduction but struggle with appropriate hypothesis suspension.
  - Quick check question: Given sequence [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], can you articulate two different valid patterns AND explain why one might be more parsimonious?

- Concept: Overfitting in Hypothesis Generation
  - Why needed here: The LLM behavior mirrors statistical overfitting—fitting a model to noise. Recognizing this parallel helps frame the problem as one of complexity control rather than pure reasoning failure.
  - Quick check question: If you fit a 4th-degree polynomial to 5 random points, will it pass through all points? Is this a good model?

- Concept: Francis Bacon's Idola Tribus (Idols of the Tribe)
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly frames LLM behavior through this philosophical lens—the human tendency to impose order on randomness. This conceptual framing guides interpretation of results as a systematic cognitive-like bias rather than random error.
  - Quick check question: Why might "seeing patterns in randomness" be an evolutionarily conserved trait in humans, and how does this analogy apply to LLMs trained on human-generated text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Number series generator -> Target LLMs -> Evaluator LLM -> Classification results
- Critical path: 1. Generate category-balanced number series; 2. Present 5-value sequences to target LLM with standardized prompt; 3. Collect single-sentence regularity descriptions (3,620 total); 4. Evaluate each description using o3 with structured classification prompt; 5. Calculate success rates
- Design tradeoffs: LLM-as-evaluator vs. human annotation (3,620 descriptions vs. accuracy); Five-term sequences balance pattern-fitting ease vs. randomness detectability; Single-sentence constraint simplifies evaluation but limits expression
- Failure signatures: Pattern forcing (generating complex explanations that don't fit all values); Verification gap (outputting patterns internally rated as invalid); Category confusion (quasi-ordered series trigger strongest overfitting)
- First 3 experiments: 1. Baseline replication - run original prompt on 20 sequences per category to verify pattern-forcing effect on random series; 2. Intervention test - compare original vs. random-allowing prompt on same sequences; 3. Self-consistency probe - test whether flagged-invalid patterns are still output

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do "thinking" models generate false patterns because they lack the capability to verify hypotheses, or do they assert regularities despite internally recognizing them as incorrect?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section states, "This suggests either that the thinking models lack sufficient capability to verify regularity hypotheses or that they assert false regularities even when they recognize them as incorrect."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluated outputs but did not analyze the internal states or chain-of-thought processes that lead to the validation of incorrect patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: An interpretability analysis of the model's internal reasoning traces during the evaluation of random series to see if "incorrect" signals are generated but ignored.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can prompting strategies that successfully mitigate knowledge hallucinations (e.g., instructing the model to say "I don't know") be effectively adapted to prevent false pattern recognition in logical reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion notes, "Further investigation is needed to determine whether these concepts can be applied to cases of logical reasoning, rather than purely knowledge-based tasks."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the bias exists but does not test specific mitigation strategies beyond adding a simple allowance for randomness in the prompt.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying "unknown" alignment techniques to the number series task used in this study.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can fine-tuning models on high-quality logical reasoning data effectively eliminate the Idola Tribus bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Discussion, "Exploring effective fine-tuning strategies is a key next step in tackling the issue."
- Why unresolved: The study evaluated existing base and instruction-tuned models but did not train new models to determine if this specific bias is separable from general language acquisition.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing that models fine-tuned specifically for logical consistency exhibit significantly lower rates of false pattern recognition on random data compared to standard models.

## Limitations

- The use of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation introduces potential circular validation issues, as all models may share similar pattern-biasing tendencies
- Random series generation using uniform integers 1-99 may be unusually amenable to pattern-fitting compared to more naturalistic randomness
- The study doesn't investigate whether different prompt engineering approaches beyond the random-allowing prompt could further mitigate the pattern-forcing tendency

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that LLMs generate incorrect pattern explanations for random sequences, and that this occurs across multiple model architectures including advanced "thinking" models
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that instruction-following pressure causes models to output patterns they internally judge as invalid, based primarily on o3 self-evaluation results
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that this represents a fundamental "Idola Tribus" cognitive bias rather than a prompt-sensitivity issue

## Next Checks

1. **Human Evaluation Validation**: Have independent human annotators evaluate a stratified sample of 200 model outputs (covering all categories and models) using the same 4-option classification scheme to measure inter-annotator agreement and assess potential systematic differences between human and o3 evaluation criteria.

2. **Complex Randomness Test**: Generate number series from non-uniform distributions (e.g., prime numbers, Fibonacci sequences, or real-world data like stock prices) and test whether the pattern-forcing tendency persists or intensifies compared to uniform random series.

3. **Alternative Prompt Engineering**: Test whether explicitly framing the task in terms of hypothesis uncertainty ("If you're not certain about a pattern, explain why") or using chain-of-thought prompting that explicitly considers "no pattern" as a hypothesis reduces false pattern generation rates compared to the random-allowing prompt.
