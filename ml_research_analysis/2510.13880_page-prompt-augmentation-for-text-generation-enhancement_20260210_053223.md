core_contribution: This paper introduces PAGE, a framework designed to enhance text
  generation from large language models (LLMs) by using simple auxiliary modules like
  classifiers or extractors. These lightweight models provide structured inferences
  from the input text, which are then incorporated into the prompt to improve generation

# PAGE: Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13880
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Framework using auxiliary classifiers to improve LLM text generation quality by 66.72-209.54% in ROUGE metrics

## Executive Summary
PAGE introduces a framework that enhances text generation from large language models by incorporating simple auxiliary modules like classifiers or extractors. These lightweight models provide structured inferences from input text, which are then incorporated into the prompt to improve generation quality and controllability. Unlike other approaches, PAGE does not require auxiliary generative models, offering a simpler, modular architecture adaptable to various tasks. A proof-of-concept in requirements engineering showed significant improvements over baseline approaches, demonstrating that simple, interpretable auxiliary modules can effectively guide LLMs to produce more accurate and structured outputs.

## Method Summary
PAGE employs lightweight auxiliary modules (e.g., classifiers) to extract structured information from input text, which is then used to construct enriched prompts for the main generative model. The framework follows a modular architecture where auxiliary outputs are combined with template-based prompt composition to guide the LLM. In the proof-of-concept, a Random Forest classifier categorized software requirements into EARS syntax templates, and the resulting category labels were used to retrieve category-specific examples that were injected into the prompt. The approach was validated using Llama 3.1 8B, achieving significant improvements in ROUGE metrics compared to baseline zero-shot generation.

## Key Results
- ROUGE-1 recall improved by 66.72% (from 0.486 to 0.809)
- ROUGE-2 recall improved by 209.54% (from 0.201 to 0.622)
- ROUGE-L recall improved by 95.21% (from 0.390 to 0.761)
- Results were within 2-4 percentage points of the "ideal" upper bound where correct labels are provided
- Classifier achieved 82.35% accuracy on EARS category classification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Classification-Guided Example Retrieval
Structured classification of input enables targeted example retrieval, which constrains the generator's output space toward desired formats. Input text is classified, category-specific examples are retrieved, and injected into the prompt, allowing the generator to pattern-match syntactic structures. The core assumption is that the generative model can effectively leverage in-context examples. Evidence shows classifier accuracy of 82.35% and that zero-shot outputs diverge from expected format while PAGE outputs match. Break condition: If classifier accuracy drops significantly (<70%), misclassified inputs retrieve wrong examples, leading to systematically incorrect output structures.

### Mechanism 2: Task Decomposition Reducing Data Requirements
Decomposing complex generation into inference (auxiliary) + generation (main model) reduces training data and compute requirements compared to end-to-end fine-tuning. The complex task is split, a lightweight classifier is trained on a small dataset, and the generator uses frozen weights. The core assumption is that the inference task is substantially simpler than full generation and can be learned from limited data. Evidence includes using only 253 instances for classifier training and claims about reduced computational resource needs. Break condition: If the inference task becomes too complex for lightweight models, the auxiliary module may require more data/compute than anticipated.

### Mechanism 3: Template-Based Prompt Composition
Explicit, configurable templates for prompt construction improve reproducibility and make the enrichment process interpretable and debuggable. Auxiliary outputs are used for template slot filling, creating a structured prompt that provides the generator with unambiguous context. The core assumption is that the template format is compatible with how the generator processes instructions and examples. Evidence includes configurable templates and demonstration of template structuring. Break condition: If templates conflict with generator's expected prompt format (e.g., token limits, example ordering), performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Few-shot Prompting**
  - Why needed here: PAGE fundamentally relies on injecting category-specific examples into prompts. Understanding zero-shot vs. few-shot performance gaps explains the 65-205% improvement over baseline.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why providing 2 examples per category might outperform providing none, even with the same generator?

- **Concept: ROUGE Metrics (Recall-Oriented Evaluation)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates generation quality using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L recall scores. Understanding what each measures is essential for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: Why might ROUGE-2 show the largest improvement (205%) compared to ROUGE-1 (65%) when using PAGE?

- **Concept: Modular Architecture Design**
  - Why needed here: PAGE's value proposition is modularity—swappable auxiliary modules without modifying the generator. This requires understanding interface contracts between components.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the overall system if you swap the Random Forest classifier for a neural classifier? What stays constant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Text -> Auxiliary Module(s) -> Structured Inference -> Prompt Composer -> Enriched Prompt -> Generative Model -> Final Output

- **Critical path:** The auxiliary module's classification accuracy is the primary bottleneck. PAGE achieves 82.35% classifier accuracy, and results show only 2-4 percentage points below the "ideal" baseline where correct labels are provided from the dataset.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Auxiliary model complexity: Random Forest chosen for low compute/interpretability, but neural classifiers could improve accuracy at cost of resources
  - Number of examples per category: Paper uses 2 examples; more examples may help but increase prompt length and token costs
  - Template flexibility: Fixed templates improve reproducibility; dynamic templates could adapt to input but add complexity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Misclassification cascade: Wrong category → wrong examples → output follows wrong syntactic pattern
  - Template mismatch: If prompt exceeds context window or examples are poorly formatted, generator may ignore them
  - Distribution shift: Classifier trained on one domain will fail on unrelated domains without retraining

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Establish zero-shot baseline: Run generator on dataset with minimal prompt to replicate Zero-Shot ROUGE scores (~0.49 recall)
  2. Validate auxiliary module in isolation: Test classifier on held-out data; target >80% accuracy
  3. Ablate the example count: Run PAGE with 0, 1, 2, and 4 examples per category to measure sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the PAGE framework maintain its performance improvements when applied to larger datasets and domains other than requirements engineering?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state that the results suggest "the suitability of expanding the validation towards datasets with more requirements and in different domains."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study only validates the framework on a small dataset (253 instances) within the specific domain of software requirements generation (EARS syntax).
- **Evidence to resolve:** Reporting evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE scores) from applying PAGE to diverse text generation tasks using significantly larger benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do errors in the auxiliary module propagate and degrade the final generation quality?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper notes qualitatively that "when classification fails, it leads the generative model to a wrong syntactic structure," highlighting a dependency not fully quantified in the results.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper reports the accuracy of the auxiliary classifier (82.35%) and the aggregate ROUGE scores, but does not isolate the correlation between specific auxiliary errors and the severity of output degradation.
- **Evidence to resolve:** An ablation study or error analysis measuring the drop in final generation quality specifically for instances where the auxiliary module made an incorrect inference.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does PAGE compare against approaches that use generative auxiliary models rather than simple classifiers?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors distinguish PAGE from methods like "Induction-Augmented Generation" (IAG) which use generative models for assistance, but do not provide experimental comparisons against these more complex architectures.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the efficiency gains of using "simple" auxiliary modules come at a significant cost to potential performance upper bounds achievable by generative assistants.
- **Evidence to resolve:** A comparative experiment evaluating PAGE against a generative-assistant baseline on the same task to analyze the trade-off between computational cost and generation quality.

## Limitations

- Classifier accuracy (82.35%) and its impact on generation quality are tightly coupled—without knowing the per-class performance breakdown, it's unclear if certain EARS categories are systematically misclassified
- The paper lacks ablation studies showing how sensitive PAGE is to the number of examples per category or whether different template structures could yield better results
- No comparison is made to fine-tuned models on the same task, making it difficult to assess the true trade-off between PAGE's efficiency and potential performance gains from traditional approaches

## Confidence

- **High:** The modular architecture and its general principle are well-supported by experimental results and ablation showing near-ideal performance when correct labels are provided
- **Medium:** The specific performance improvements are credible but task-specific; generalization to other domains or tasks is not demonstrated
- **Low:** Claims about computational efficiency are based on comparing PAGE to "no auxiliary modules" rather than to fine-tuning baselines; the actual resource savings are therefore uncertain

## Next Checks

1. **Per-class Classifier Analysis:** Break down the 82.35% accuracy by EARS category to identify systematic weaknesses. Test whether misclassified categories correspond to the most frequent generation errors.
2. **Example Count Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the number of examples per category (0, 1, 2, 4, 8) and measure ROUGE score changes to find the optimal configuration.
3. **Fine-tuning Baseline Comparison:** Train a small generative model (e.g., GPT-2) on the same 253-instance dataset and compare its ROUGE performance and training time to PAGE.
