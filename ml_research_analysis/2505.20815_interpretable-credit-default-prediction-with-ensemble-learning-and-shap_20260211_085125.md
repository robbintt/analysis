# Interpretable Credit Default Prediction with Ensemble Learning and SHAP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.20815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20815
- Authors: Shiqi Yang; Ziyi Huang; Wengran Xiao; Xinyu Shen
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: XGBoost achieved 78.04% accuracy, 76.98% precision, and 75.19% recall in credit default prediction

## Executive Summary
This study applies machine learning to credit default prediction using the Home Credit dataset. The research preprocesses data, engineers features, and trains multiple models including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting methods like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. XGBoost achieved the best performance with 78.04% accuracy, 76.98% precision, and 75.19% recall, especially excelling at recall which is critical for minimizing false negatives in default detection. SHAP analysis revealed that external credit scores (EXT SOURCE 3 and EXT SOURCE 2) are the most influential features in model decisions, highlighting the importance of external scoring data in credit risk assessment. The results demonstrate that ensemble learning methods effectively capture complex, nonlinear relationships and outperform traditional models, offering a robust technical foundation for intelligent credit risk control systems.

## Key Results
- XGBoost achieved 78.04% accuracy, 76.98% precision, and 75.19% recall in credit default prediction
- Model excels at recall, critical for minimizing false negatives in default detection
- External credit scores (EXT SOURCE 3 and EXT SOURCE 2) identified as most influential features through SHAP analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Ensemble learning methods effectively capture complex, nonlinear relationships in credit data that traditional linear models cannot adequately represent. XGBoost's gradient boosting framework iteratively corrects errors from previous trees, allowing it to learn intricate patterns in default behavior. The model's superior recall performance indicates it successfully identifies high-risk cases that simpler models might miss, which is crucial for financial institutions seeking to minimize losses from defaults. SHAP analysis provides post-hoc interpretability by quantifying each feature's contribution to individual predictions, bridging the gap between model complexity and regulatory requirements for explainable credit decisions.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Gradient Boosting Mechanism** - Why needed: Sequential error correction improves prediction accuracy; Quick check: Monitor training loss reduction across boosting rounds
2. **SHAP Value Interpretation** - Why needed: Provides additive feature contribution explanations; Quick check: Verify SHAP values sum to model output
3. **Feature Engineering Importance** - Why needed: Domain-specific transformations capture risk patterns; Quick check: Compare performance with and without engineered features
4. **Ensemble Method Selection** - Why needed: Different algorithms capture different data patterns; Quick check: Analyze performance variance across model types
5. **Credit Default Prediction Metrics** - Why needed: Accuracy alone insufficient for imbalanced financial data; Quick check: Balance precision-recall tradeoff for business objectives
6. **External Data Integration** - Why needed: Complements internal data for comprehensive risk assessment; Quick check: Measure performance impact of external data inclusion

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data Preprocessing -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> SHAP Analysis -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path: Data Cleaning → Feature Selection → Model Optimization → Interpretability Analysis → Validation

Design Tradeoffs: Model complexity vs interpretability, computational cost vs prediction accuracy, generalization vs overfitting

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on minority class indicates class imbalance issues; Inconsistent SHAP explanations suggest model instability

First Experiments:
1. Baseline logistic regression performance comparison
2. Cross-validation with different random seeds
3. SHAP explanation consistency across model iterations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Research focuses exclusively on Home Credit dataset, limiting generalizability to other credit markets
- SHAP explanations not validated through external domain expertise or stakeholder feedback
- Lacks comparison with industry-standard benchmarks or alternative performance measures

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are well-documented and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: Feature importance rankings from SHAP analysis are methodologically sound but may vary with different datasets or preprocessing steps.

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability of findings to other credit markets or institutional contexts without further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Test trained models on out-of-sample datasets from different geographic regions or credit institutions to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct stakeholder validation by comparing SHAP-derived feature importance with domain experts' assessments in credit risk management.

3. Perform ablation studies to quantify the marginal contribution of each ensemble method and preprocessing step to overall performance.
