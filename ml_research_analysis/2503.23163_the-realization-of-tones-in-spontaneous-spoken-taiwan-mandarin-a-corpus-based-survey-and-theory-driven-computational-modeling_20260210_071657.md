# The realization of tones in spontaneous spoken Taiwan Mandarin: a corpus-based survey and theory-driven computational modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.23163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23163
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Word identity and contextual meaning (sense) predict f0 contours more strongly than canonical tone patterns in spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin speech.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how Mandarin tones are realized in spontaneous speech, challenging the traditional view that tones are purely phonological. Using GAMs on a corpus of 4,283 tokens, the researchers found that word identity and contextual meaning predict pitch contours more strongly than tone patterns alone. They then demonstrate that contextualized embeddings from GPT-2 can predict token-specific pitch contours with accuracy significantly above chance, supporting a model where form and meaning are deeply entangled in speech production.

## Method Summary
The study used the Corpus of Spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin, extracting f0 contours from disyllabic words with all 20 tone combinations. GAMs modeled pitch as smooth functions of time, word, and tone pattern, while controlling for speaker, gender, speech rate, and position. For computational modeling, GPT-2 generated contextualized embeddings, which were linearly mapped to fixed-length pitch vectors derived from GAM predictions. The Discriminative Lexicon Model framework guided the analysis, testing whether semantic information could predict phonetic details.

## Key Results
- Word emerged as a crucial predictor of f0 contours, with effect sizes exceeding those of tone pattern
- Sense type (contextualized meaning) was an even stronger predictor than word identity
- Linear mapping from GPT-2 embeddings to pitch contours achieved 15.1% accuracy (test) significantly above 1.3% baseline
- The findings challenge traditional linguistic axioms about the arbitrariness of the sign

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The fine phonetic detail of pitch contours is co-determined by word meaning (semantics), often outweighing the contribution of the canonical tone pattern.
- **Mechanism:** The production system modulates the motor plan based on the specific semantic vector of the word or "sense" in context, resulting in a unique "pitch signature."
- **Core assumption:** Statistical predictors like `word` and `sense type` serve as effective proxies for semantic content.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - AIC analysis shows withholding `word` increases AIC by 7430-12320 units versus ~22 units for `tone pattern`
  - Distinct words sharing the same tone pattern exhibit significantly different average f0 contours
- **Break condition:** If segmental physiology (e.g., vowel height) drove the effect, `word` would cease to be superior once segmental variables were fully controlled.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** A linear mapping function is sufficient to predict continuous pitch contours from high-dimensional semantic embeddings.
- **Mechanism:** Under the Discriminative Lexicon Model, form-meaning mapping occurs via matrix multiplication where semantic vectors map to phonetic features.
- **Core assumption:** The nonlinear complexity of speech production can be approximated linearly for specific features like pitch.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Linear mapping $SG = C$ successfully predicted pitch contours with 23.5% train / 15.1% test accuracy
  - Predicted contours closely matched "gold standard" GAM-derived contours
- **Break condition:** If deep nonlinear networks were required for above-chance accuracy, the linear isomorphy hypothesis would be insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Contextualized embeddings capture "sense" variance that aligns with phonetic realization.
- **Mechanism:** GPT-2 assigns unique vectors to words in different contexts, capturing the same semantic distinctions that drive pitch variation.
- **Core assumption:** The GPT-2 embedding space shares sufficient geometry with the human semantic space used for speech production.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - Replacing `word` with `sense type` further improves model fit (AIC decrease)
  - Token-specific predictions achieved 7.7% accuracy, supporting context-semantics-phonetics links
- **Break condition:** If GPT-2 embeddings failed to capture the specific "sense" distinctions used by speakers, accuracy would degrade to baseline levels.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMs)**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard linear models cannot handle the time-series nature of pitch contours. GAMs allow modeling of nonlinear "wiggly" curves over time and separation by factors.
  - **Quick check question:** In the formula $s(normalized\ t,\ word)$, what is the function $s$ doing differently for each word compared to a standard linear interaction?

- **Concept:** **Contextualized Embeddings (vs. Static)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper relies on the premise that meaning shifts by context. Static vectors provide one vector per word type, which would conflate different "senses."
  - **Quick check question:** Why would a static embedding for "bank" fail to predict different pitch contours for "river bank" vs. "bank account"?

- **Concept:** **Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM)**
  - **Why needed here:** This framework replaces "arbitrariness of the sign" by positing that form and meaning are entangled and mapped via matrices.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the DLM view the lexicon as a list of entries or as a continuous high-dimensional space where forms and meanings are mapped?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Audio (Corpus) + Transcriptions -> Praat f0 extraction -> GAM smoothing -> 100-dim pitch vectors; Context sentences -> GPT-2 -> 768-dim embeddings; Linear mapping $SG = C$ -> Nearest-neighbor search in form space

- **Critical path:** The GAM smoothing step converting variable-length raw audio to fixed 100-dim vectors is critical, as it makes the linear algebra of the DLM possible by aligning dimensions and reducing noise.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Method II (type-level) achieved higher test accuracy (15.1%) than Method III (token-level, 7.7%), suggesting benefits from regularization vs. context-specific noise
  - Linear mapping was chosen to test DLM hypothesis, though neural networks might boost accuracy but obscure theoretical claims

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High concurvity (>0.9) between word and tone pattern causing unstable estimates
  - Baseline collapse to ~1.3% accuracy invalidating semantics-determines-form hypothesis
  - Visual divergence between predicted and GAM contours suggesting invalid linear mapping

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity Check:** Shuffle mapping between semantic vectors $S$ and pitch vectors $C$; verify accuracy drops to minimum
  2. **Ablation:** Replace GPT-2 with static FastText vectors; if accuracy drops significantly, confirms contextual sense drives prediction
  3. **Dimensionality Stress Test:** Reduce pitch vector size from 100 to 20 dimensions; observe if accuracy plummets, indicating loss of fine phonetic detail

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How should realization of tone patterns involving the neutral tone be interpreted within the DLM framework? The observed descending contours could be viewed as classical sandhi or meaning-driven patterning, requiring analysis of semantic vectors of neutral-tone words.

- **Open Question 2:** Do human learners generate pitch contours from semantic representations similarly to the machine-learned linear mapping? While the study proved machines can learn this mapping, it lacks psycholinguistic evidence that humans utilize the same mechanism during acquisition or production.

- **Open Question 3:** Why do isomorphisms between form and meaning exist across diverse language types like Mandarin (tone) and English (stress)? The study establishes these mappings exist but lacks theoretical explanation for functional or cognitive drivers causing semantic information to shape phonetic details consistently across linguistic systems.

## Limitations

- Data Scope: Focus on disyllabic words in Taiwan Mandarin limits generalizability to other word lengths, languages, or speech styles
- Statistical Confounding: Perfect control of segmental factors is impossible; word effects could partially reflect unmeasured articulatory properties
- Embedding Alignment: Assumption that GPT-2 embeddings capture the same semantic distinctions speakers use remains unverified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Statistical finding that word identity predicts f0 contours beyond tone pattern effects is well-supported by robust AIC comparisons
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about "sense" driving pitch variation more than word identity are supported but depend on detailed semantic analysis pipeline
- **Low Confidence:** Strongest theoretical claims about deep form-meaning entanglement and challenges to linguistic arbitrariness go beyond what data strictly support

## Next Checks

- **Validation Check 1:** Replace GPT-2 contextualized embeddings with static word embeddings (e.g., FastText) and re-run linear mapping; if accuracy drops to baseline, confirms contextual sense distinctions drive success
- **Validation Check 2:** Apply same methodology to language with less tonal complexity (e.g., English); if word identity still predicts pitch contours beyond segmental factors, strengthens general form-meaning entanglement claims
- **Validation Check 3:** Conduct production experiment with semantically related vs. unrelated contexts; measure whether context-induced meaning shifts produce measurable f0 differences, providing causal evidence for semantic-phonetic link
