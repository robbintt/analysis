# Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Transformer Condition Monitoring -- Part I: Basic Concepts, Neural Networks, and Variants

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.22190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22190
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: CNN-based acoustic monitoring achieves >98% accuracy for OLTC state classification; RL-based switching control reduces transformer inrush currents.

## Executive Summary
This paper surveys Neural Network (NN) methods for transformer condition monitoring, presenting foundational concepts and demonstrating their application through two case studies. The work covers basic NN architectures including MLPs and CNNs for structured data analysis, and Reinforcement Learning for control tasks. A key contribution is showing CNNs achieving over 98% accuracy in OLTC acoustic monitoring through spectrogram-based feature extraction, alongside RL-based switching control that reduces inrush currents in transformers. The paper aims to unify these NN approaches under a common framework for reliable, data-efficient, and uncertainty-aware transformer health management.

## Method Summary
The paper presents two primary case studies: (1) OLTC state classification using CNNs on acoustic signals transformed to time-frequency representations via STFT, and (2) transformer inrush current minimization using RL agents trained on physics-based simulation environments. For the CNN approach, 48 kHz acoustic recordings are segmented into 360 ms clips and converted to Mel spectrograms (17×1024 input dimensions). The CNN architecture uses Conv2D layers with softplus/ReLU activations and softmax output for 7-class classification. For RL, the control problem is formulated as an MDP where the agent observes remanent fluxes (Φ₁, Φ₂, Φ₃) and selects closing angles to minimize peak inrush current. PPO algorithm is benchmarked against DQN variants with linear and exponential ε-greedy decay.

## Key Results
- CNNs achieve >98% classification accuracy for OLTC state monitoring from acoustic signals
- RL-based switching control reduces transformer inrush currents compared to conventional methods
- PPO algorithm outperforms DQN variants in RL control tasks, achieving lowest mean and variance in inrush distribution

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CNNs achieve high accuracy (>98%) for OLTC state classification from acoustic signals when signals are transformed to time-frequency representations.
- Mechanism: The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) converts 1D acoustic waveforms into 2D spectrograms, exposing time-localized frequency bursts that correspond to mechanical events. CNN kernels then learn hierarchical features—edges in early layers, complex event signatures in deeper layers—through weight sharing across spatial locations.
- Core assumption: The diagnostic information in acoustic signals is preserved and made explicit in the spectrogram representation; background noise does not corrupt the discriminative features beyond recovery.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III-D]: "The proposed approach achieved over 98% classification accuracy on unseen audio signals... While the CNN maintained high accuracy in the presence of synthetic noise, real-world tests revealed sensitivity to background humming, requiring a preprocessing denoising step."
  - [section III-C]: Eq. (8)-(9) define the STFT and spectrogram transformation used.
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus evidence for this specific CNN-spectrogram mechanism; related work (Part II, sensor placement PINNs) addresses different modalities.
- Break condition: Real-world background humming corrupts spectrogram features; denoising preprocessing becomes critical. If noise dominates signal-to-noise ratio, accuracy degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) approximate nonlinear input-output mappings for transformer diagnostics through gradient-based optimization of layered transformations.
- Mechanism: Each fully connected layer computes `FC(X) = σ(XW + b)` where σ is a smooth activation (softplus in this paper). Stacking layers enables universal function approximation. Backpropagation computes gradients via chain rule, enabling SGD to minimize MSE (regression) or cross-entropy (classification).
- Core assumption: Sufficient labeled training data exists; the underlying relationship is learnable (not purely stochastic); the network capacity matches problem complexity without severe overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II-A]: Eq. (1)-(3) define the FC layer, softplus activation, and MSE loss.
  - [section II-B]: "For regression tasks, the mean squared error (MSE) is a common choice... classification problems commonly employ a softmax output with categorical cross-entropy loss."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus contradiction; Part II extends NNs with physics constraints but doesn't invalidate MLP fundamentals.
- Break condition: Scarce training data leads to overfitting; high-dimensional inputs with limited samples cause poor generalization; purely data-driven models lack extrapolation guarantees.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reinforcement Learning agents can learn switching policies that minimize transformer inrush current by interacting with a physics-based simulation environment.
- Mechanism: The control problem is formulated as an MDP `(S, A, P, R, γ)`. The agent observes remanent fluxes `(Φ₁, Φ₂, Φ₃)`, selects a closing angle action, and receives reward based on peak inrush current (Eq. 10). Neural networks approximate the policy π(a|s). PPO algorithm showed lowest mean and variance in inrush distribution.
- Core assumption: The simulation environment accurately captures transformer magnetization dynamics (Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model); the reward function correctly encodes the control objective; exploration in simulation transfers to real operation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV-C]: Eq. (10) defines the reward function; Fig. 7 shows PPO outperforms DQN variants.
  - [section IV-C]: "PPO yields the lowest mean and variance, achieving safer energization behavior."
  - [corpus]: Part II and related PINN work suggest physics-informed simulators improve RL training fidelity, but no direct validation of sim-to-real transfer in this paper.
- Break condition: Simulation-to-reality gap (model mismatch); reward hacking (agent finds unintended optima); safety violations during exploration require constrained/safe RL methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Spectrogram Time-Frequency Analysis**
  - Why needed here: CNNs require 2D image-like inputs; STFT converts raw audio into time-frequency representations where mechanical events appear as localized bursts.
  - Quick check question: Given a 48 kHz audio signal and 1024-sample Hamming window, what is the approximate time resolution of each spectrogram column?

- Concept: **Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation**
  - Why needed here: RL problems must be cast as MDPs with defined states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards before training agents.
  - Quick check question: For transformer inrush control, what constitutes the state space, action space, and reward signal?

- Concept: **Backpropagation and Gradient Descent**
  - Why needed here: All NN variants (MLP, CNN, RL policy networks) rely on gradient-based optimization; understanding chain rule propagation is essential for debugging training failures.
  - Quick check question: If the loss plateaus but training error remains high, what does this suggest about the optimization landscape or network capacity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw Sensor Data -> Preprocessing (STFT/Denoising) -> CNN Feature Extraction -> Classification Head -> OLTC State
- Critical path:
  1. Data quality: Acoustic signals must be sampled at adequate rate (≥48 kHz per case study) with synchronized event labels.
  2. Representation: STFT parameters (window length, hop size) determine time-frequency resolution tradeoff.
  3. Model selection: CNNs for structured signals; MLPs for low-dimensional vectors; RL agents for sequential control.
  4. Validation: Hold-out test sets; noise robustness evaluation; sim-to-real gap assessment for RL.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Window length L: Longer windows improve frequency resolution but blur transient events.
  - CNN depth vs. data: Deeper networks capture hierarchical features but require more training data.
  - RL exploration vs. safety: Aggressive exploration may discover better policies but risks constraint violations.
  - Softmax vs. linear output: Softmax for classification probabilities; linear for regression values.

- Failure signatures:
  - CNN accuracy drops on real-world data but not synthetic noise -> preprocessing/denoising pipeline inadequate.
  - RL policy achieves low simulation reward but fails in deployment -> simulation-reality gap in transformer model.
  - Training loss diverges -> learning rate too high or activation saturation; check gradient magnitudes.
  - Overfitting with limited data -> add regularization (dropout, weight decay) or reduce network capacity.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline CNN on clean spectrograms**: Train the OLTC classification CNN from Section III-D on clean audio. Target >95% accuracy. Confirm architecture (kernel sizes, filter counts) matches Fig. 2.
  2. **Noise robustness test**: Add synthetic Gaussian noise at varying SNR levels; identify the degradation threshold. Then test with real background humming recordings to quantify preprocessing requirements.
  3. **RL policy ablation**: Train PPO and DQN agents on the inrush minimization task. Compare peak inrush distributions. Vary reward function (e.g., add penalty for switching delay) to assess reward sensitivity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can self-supervised learning frameworks be integrated to enable adaptive diagnosis of previously unseen operating patterns in transformer monitoring?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V identifies the integration of self-supervised learning as a "promising direction" to address the limitation of models struggling with new anomalies.
- Why unresolved: Current supervised models require labeled datasets of specific faults, limiting their ability to generalize to novel or evolving fault scenarios without retraining.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a self-supervised system successfully detecting and classifying novel mechanical faults in OLTC data without prior exposure to those specific fault labels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Reinforcement Learning (RL) decision-making strategies be effectively combined with Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction models for predictive maintenance scheduling?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V states that combining RL strategies with RUL prediction models can "pave the way for predictive, cost-effective maintenance scheduling."
- Why unresolved: The paper treats prognostics and control (RL) largely as separate domains; a unified architecture that uses RUL predictions to dynamically influence control policies or maintenance triggers is not yet established.
- What evidence would resolve it: An integrated model where the RL agent's reward function is explicitly weighted by RUL predictions to balance immediate performance against long-term asset degradation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can CNN-based acoustic monitoring achieve robustness against real-world background noise (e.g., background humming) without relying on explicit pre-processing denoising steps?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section III-D notes that while CNNs performed well, real-world tests revealed sensitivity to background humming that required a "pre-processing denoising step."
- Why unresolved: The necessity of a separate denoising stage suggests the neural network lacks inherent robustness to environmental noise variability, adding complexity to the deployment pipeline.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified CNN architecture or training regimen (e.g., using augmented noisy data) that maintains >98% accuracy on raw, unprocessed field recordings containing variable background hum.

## Limitations

- Limited real-world validation: CNN robustness claims rely on synthetic noise testing; actual field data from operational transformers is not provided.
- Incomplete architectural details: CNN layer specifications and RL hyperparameters are omitted, hindering exact reproduction and performance benchmarking.
- Data and model specifics: No dataset size, class balance, or transformer simulation model parameters are disclosed, limiting reproducibility and generalizability assessments.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Basic NN concepts (MLP, backpropagation, gradient descent) are well-established and correctly presented.
- **Medium confidence**: CNN and RL case studies demonstrate proof-of-concept feasibility, but limited validation data and architectural details reduce generalizability confidence.
- **Low confidence**: Claims of sim-to-real RL transfer and noise robustness in operational environments lack direct empirical support.

## Next Checks

1. **CNN real-world robustness test**: Evaluate the OLTC classifier on field-collected acoustic data from operational transformers, including background noise and variable operating conditions.
2. **Dataset and model disclosure**: Release dataset statistics (class sizes, splits) and full CNN architecture specifications (layer counts, filter dimensions, regularization) to enable independent benchmarking.
3. **Transformer simulation model validation**: Publish the electrical model equations and parameter values used in the RL environment, and validate against real transformer inrush current measurements.
