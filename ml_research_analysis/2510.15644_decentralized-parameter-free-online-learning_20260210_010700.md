# Decentralized Parameter-Free Online Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15644
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15644
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Proposes parameter-free decentralized online learning algorithms with sublinear regret bounds

## Executive Summary
This paper presents decentralized parameter-free online learning algorithms for multi-agent systems, combining the parameter-free nature of coin-betting methods with the multi-agent framework of decentralized online learning. The key contribution is showing that parameter-free algorithms can be extended to the decentralized setting while maintaining sublinear regret bounds. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms achieve optimal or near-optimal regret bounds matching the lower bounds in the multi-agent setting.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two decentralized parameter-free online learning algorithms based on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework with specific regularizers derived from coin-betting methods. The algorithms operate in a multi-agent setting where agents communicate over a strongly connected directed graph. Each agent maintains a local decision variable and updates it based on local observations and information received from neighboring agents. The key innovation is incorporating parameter-free coin-betting techniques into the decentralized setting, allowing the algorithms to adapt to unknown problem parameters without manual tuning.

## Key Results
- Proves sublinear regret bounds for the proposed decentralized parameter-free algorithms
- Shows the regret bounds match the lower bounds in the multi-agent setting
- Demonstrates that parameter-free methods can be successfully extended to decentralized online learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by combining the adaptive nature of coin-betting methods with decentralized consensus mechanisms. Coin-betting methods maintain a potential function that bets on future gradients, allowing them to adapt to unknown problem parameters. By incorporating this into the FTRL framework and extending it to the multi-agent setting, the algorithms can achieve optimal regret bounds without requiring knowledge of problem parameters. The decentralized nature allows agents to learn collaboratively while maintaining individual regret guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

**Online Convex Optimization**
- Why needed: Forms the theoretical foundation for analyzing regret in sequential decision making
- Quick check: Verify that loss functions are convex and the decision space is convex

**Decentralized Optimization**
- Why needed: Provides the framework for multi-agent learning without central coordination
- Quick check: Ensure the communication graph is strongly connected and directed

**Coin-Betting Algorithms**
- Why needed: Enables parameter-free adaptation to unknown problem parameters
- Quick check: Verify that the potential function satisfies the required properties

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input signals -> Local decision maker -> Regularizer update -> Gradient computation -> Communication with neighbors -> Consensus update -> Output decisions

**Critical Path**
Local decision → Gradient computation → Communication → Consensus update → New decision

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Parameter-free vs. tuned performance: Parameter-free methods sacrifice some potential performance for adaptability
- Communication frequency vs. convergence speed: More frequent communication can improve convergence but increases overhead
- Local computation complexity vs. regret bounds: More complex regularizers can yield better regret bounds but require more computation

**Failure Signatures**
- Divergence when communication graph is not strongly connected
- Linear regret growth if consensus mechanism fails
- Poor performance if initialization is far from optimal

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Test regret bounds on a simple quadratic loss function with known parameters
2. Evaluate performance on a distributed regression task with varying agent numbers
3. Analyze sensitivity to communication graph topology and frequency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the lack of empirical validation and the initialization concerns represent implicit open questions about practical implementation.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation provided - all results are theoretical
- Initialization of certain variables may still require careful tuning
- Strong assumptions about communication graph (strongly connected directed graphs) may not hold in practice

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Theoretical regret bounds | High |
| Practical applicability | Medium |
| Parameter-free nature | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the algorithms on benchmark online learning problems to verify theoretical regret bounds
2. Analyze the sensitivity to initialization choices and network topology variations
3. Compare performance against existing decentralized online learning algorithms with carefully tuned parameters
