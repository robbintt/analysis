core_contribution: This paper tackles the problem of linear stochastic bandits when
  the true parameter norm is unknown, a requirement that can lead to poor performance
  if the assumed bound is mis-specified. The authors propose Empirical Bound Information-Directed
  Sampling (EBIDS), which iteratively refines a high-probability upper bound on the
  parameter norm using accumulated data.

# Empirical Bound Information-Directed Sampling for Norm-Agnostic Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05098
- Reference count: 40
- Authors propose a novel algorithm for linear stochastic bandits that achieves regret bounds independent of initially assumed parameter norm

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of linear stochastic bandits when the true parameter norm is unknown, which can lead to poor performance if the assumed bound is mis-specified. The authors introduce Empirical Bound Information-Directed Sampling (EBIDS), an algorithm that iteratively refines a high-probability upper bound on the parameter norm using accumulated data. Through a two-phase approach combining bound-exploration and bound-exploitation, EBIDS achieves regret bounds that are independent of the initially assumed parameter norm and eventually match the rate of an oracle algorithm with access to the true norm.

## Method Summary
EBIDS employs a two-phase strategy: a bound-exploration phase that balances improving the parameter norm estimate with direct action selection, and a bound-exploitation phase that uses the refined bound for subsequent decisions. The algorithm leverages a mixture of information gain criteria, including a novel component targeting the improvement of the parameter norm bound. By iteratively refining the parameter norm estimate and transitioning between exploration and exploitation phases, EBIDS achieves theoretical guarantees that do not depend on the initially assumed parameter norm, while maintaining competitive empirical performance.

## Key Results
- EBIDS achieves regret bounds independent of the initially assumed parameter norm
- The algorithm eventually matches the regret rate of an oracle algorithm with access to the true norm
- Simulations demonstrate EBIDS outperforms competing norm-agnostic algorithms with regret approaching that of the oracle algorithm

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EBIDS works by addressing the fundamental challenge in norm-agnostic bandits where mis-specification of the parameter norm bound can lead to poor performance. The algorithm's key innovation lies in its iterative refinement of the parameter norm bound through accumulated data, allowing it to eventually converge to a bound that is close to the true norm. The two-phase approach ensures that the algorithm can balance between improving its estimate of the norm and making effective decisions, while the information gain criterion specifically targets improvements in the parameter norm bound estimate.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linear Stochastic Bandits**: Sequential decision-making framework where rewards are linear functions of unknown parameters. Needed to understand the problem setting and constraints. Quick check: Verify understanding of linear reward structure and exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
- **Information-Directed Sampling**: Algorithm design principle that uses information gain to guide exploration. Needed to understand how EBIDS balances exploration and exploitation. Quick check: Review how information gain is computed and used in bandit algorithms.
- **High-Probability Bounds**: Statistical guarantees that hold with probability at least 1-δ. Needed to understand the theoretical guarantees of EBIDS. Quick check: Verify understanding of concentration inequalities and their application in bandit algorithms.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Data Collection -> Parameter Norm Estimation -> Information Gain Calculation -> Action Selection -> Regret Accumulation
- **Critical Path**: The algorithm's performance depends critically on the accuracy of the parameter norm estimation and the effectiveness of the information gain criterion in guiding exploration.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The two-phase approach trades off between exploration (improving norm estimate) and exploitation (using refined norm for decisions). The transition criteria between phases is a key design decision that impacts performance.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may result from inaccurate parameter norm estimation, ineffective information gain criterion, or suboptimal transition between phases. The algorithm may also be sensitive to problem-specific constants in the regret bound.
- **Three First Experiments**: 1) Test EBIDS on a simple linear bandit problem with known parameter norm to verify basic functionality. 2) Evaluate the algorithm's performance on problems with varying dimensionalities to assess scalability. 3) Compare EBIDS against competing norm-agnostic algorithms on a range of problem instances to demonstrate empirical advantages.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The transition criteria between bound-exploration and bound-exploitation phases may introduce practical challenges in implementation
- The regret bound still depends on problem-specific constants, which could impact practical performance
- The information gain criterion for parameter norm bound improvement may vary in effectiveness depending on problem structure

## Confidence
- High: Theoretical claims about regret bound independence from initial norm assumptions
- Medium: Practical performance improvements over competing algorithms, though more extensive empirical validation would strengthen these claims

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate EBIDS performance across a wider range of problem instances, including varying dimensionalities and reward distributions
2. Implement EBIDS with different transition criteria between bound-exploration and bound-exploitation phases to assess robustness
3. Compare EBIDS performance against alternative norm-agnostic approaches in more diverse and challenging bandit scenarios
