# Automating Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning using a Skill-Based Bayesian Network

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.15662
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15662
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces SEBN (Skill-Environment Bayesian Networks), a probabilistic framework for modeling the relationship between environment features, agent competencies, and task performance to guide curriculum learning in reinforcement learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SEBN (Skill-Environment Bayesian Networks), a probabilistic framework for modeling the relationship between environment features, agent competencies, and task performance to guide curriculum learning in reinforcement learning. SEBN uses past rollouts to infer competency levels and predict success rates on new tasks, enabling automated curriculum generation without explicit evaluation on each environment. The method is evaluated across three domains: DoorKey (gridworld), BipedalWalker (continuous control), and Robosuite (robotics), showing that SEBN-guided curricula improve learning efficiency and generalization compared to uniform or anti-curriculum baselines.

## Method Summary
SEBN constructs a Bayesian network to represent the joint probability distribution over environment features, agent competencies, and task performance. The framework leverages past rollouts to infer competency levels and predict success rates on new tasks, enabling automated curriculum generation without explicit evaluation on each environment. The method discretizes environment features into bins and assumes conditional independence between features given competency, which may limit its applicability to high-dimensional or highly interactive state spaces.

## Key Results
- SEBN-guided curricula improve learning efficiency and generalization compared to uniform or anti-curriculum baselines.
- The framework is evaluated across three domains: DoorKey (gridworld), BipedalWalker (continuous control), and Robosuite (robotics).
- Empirical results show promising performance, but the evaluation is limited in diversity and does not explore the method's performance under varying amounts of prior data or in transfer scenarios.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SEBN leverages Bayesian inference to estimate the probability of success on new tasks given observed rollouts. By modeling the relationship between environment features, agent competencies, and task performance, the framework can predict which tasks are most likely to be learnable by the agent at a given stage. This allows for automated curriculum generation that adapts to the agent's current competency level, focusing learning on tasks that are neither too easy nor too difficult.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Networks**: Probabilistic graphical models representing dependencies between variables. Needed to model the relationship between environment features, competencies, and performance. Quick check: Can you draw the Bayesian network structure used in SEBN?
- **Curriculum Learning**: Training strategy that presents tasks in a specific order to improve learning efficiency. Needed to understand the motivation behind SEBN. Quick check: What are the key differences between SEBN and traditional curriculum learning approaches?
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Needed to understand the context in which SEBN is applied. Quick check: How does SEBN integrate with existing RL algorithms?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment features -> SEBN -> Competency estimation -> Task selection -> Reinforcement Learning

**Critical Path**: SEBN infers competencies from past rollouts, predicts success rates on new tasks, and selects the most appropriate task for the agent to learn next, guiding the RL process.

**Design Tradeoffs**: SEBN trades off model complexity (via discretization and conditional independence assumptions) for computational efficiency and scalability. The framework prioritizes automation and adaptability over perfect modeling of complex feature interactions.

**Failure Signatures**: If SEBN fails to accurately estimate competencies or predict task difficulty, the curriculum may be suboptimal, leading to inefficient learning or poor generalization. Failure may also occur if the discretization of features loses critical information or if the conditional independence assumption is strongly violated.

**First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate SEBN in a high-dimensional continuous control task with many interacting state features to test the binning approach and independence assumptions; 2) Conduct an ablation study to quantify the impact of the Bayesian network's conditional independence assumption on curriculum quality; 3) Test the framework's performance when only a small amount of prior data is available to assess its data efficiency and robustness to sparse experience.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework relies on discretizing environment features into bins, which may become impractical or lose critical information in continuous, high-dimensional domains.
- The assumption of conditional independence between features given competency may not hold in environments with strong feature interactions, potentially limiting the model's predictive accuracy.
- The empirical evaluation is limited in diversity and does not explore the method's performance under varying amounts of prior data or in transfer scenarios.

## Confidence
- **High**: SEBN's effectiveness in the tested gridworld and low-dimensional control tasks.
- **Medium**: The core claims of improved learning efficiency and generalization compared to baselines.
- **Low**: The method's generalization to more complex, real-world robotics scenarios without further validation.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SEBN in a high-dimensional continuous control task with many interacting state features to test the binning approach and independence assumptions.
2. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the impact of the Bayesian network's conditional independence assumption on curriculum quality.
3. Test the framework's performance when only a small amount of prior data is available to assess its data efficiency and robustness to sparse experience.
