# Advances in Pre-trained Language Models for Domain-Specific Text Classification: A Systematic Review

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.17892
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17892
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Domain-specific PLMs (BioBERT, SciBERT) outperform general-purpose models in specialized text classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review analyzed 41 articles on pre-trained language models for domain-specific text classification from 2018-2024. The study examined modern approaches like BERT, BioBERT, and SciBERT against traditional methods, focusing on challenges in specialized domains like biomedical and finance. Experiments showed BioBERT achieved highest F1 score of 0.74 in biomedical sentence classification, while SciBERT excelled in background and conclusion categorization. The review highlighted that domain-specific models significantly outperform general-purpose models in specialized tasks, particularly when fine-tuned with appropriate techniques like transfer learning and prompt-based learning. Key challenges include computational costs, data availability, and ethical concerns around bias. The study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of techniques and identifies future research directions for improving domain adaptation and model efficiency.

## Method Summary
The review employed systematic literature review methodology, analyzing 41 articles published between 2018-2024 on pre-trained language models for domain-specific text classification. The study examined various approaches including BERT, BioBERT, SciBERT, and traditional machine learning methods. The analysis focused on performance metrics, challenges, and applications across specialized domains such as biomedical, finance, and scientific literature. The review synthesized findings on fine-tuning techniques, transfer learning approaches, and prompt-based learning methods while identifying key limitations and future research directions.

## Key Results
- BioBERT achieved highest F1 score of 0.74 in biomedical sentence classification tasks
- SciBERT demonstrated superior performance in categorizing background and conclusion sections of scientific documents
- Domain-specific models consistently outperformed general-purpose models in specialized classification tasks when properly fine-tuned

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Domain-specific pre-trained language models work effectively because they are trained on specialized corpora that capture domain-specific terminology, context, and linguistic patterns. These models learn task-specific embeddings that better represent domain concepts and relationships compared to general-purpose models. The fine-tuning process allows these models to adapt to specific classification tasks while maintaining the learned domain knowledge. Transfer learning enables knowledge transfer from large-scale pre-training to specialized downstream tasks, while prompt-based learning provides flexible task adaptation without extensive fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Transfer Learning**: Why needed - enables knowledge transfer from pre-training to downstream tasks; Quick check - measure performance improvement when using pre-trained weights vs random initialization
2. **Fine-tuning Techniques**: Why needed - adapts pre-trained models to specific classification tasks; Quick check - compare performance across different fine-tuning strategies (full fine-tuning, adapter-based, prompt-based)
3. **Domain Adaptation**: Why needed - addresses domain shift between general and specialized corpora; Quick check - evaluate performance gap between in-domain and out-of-domain data
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Why needed - provides task-specific guidance without extensive parameter updates; Quick check - test different prompt formats and their impact on classification accuracy
5. **Computational Efficiency**: Why needed - manages resource constraints for large PLMs; Quick check - measure training/inference time and memory usage across different model sizes
6. **Bias Detection**: Why needed - identifies and mitigates domain-specific biases; Quick check - analyze prediction patterns across different demographic or topic groups

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pre-training Corpus -> PLM Architecture -> Fine-tuning Layer -> Classification Head -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Pre-training data selection → Model architecture choice → Fine-tuning strategy → Evaluation metrics → Result analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Model size vs computational efficiency
- Generalizability vs domain specificity
- Fine-tuning depth vs catastrophic forgetting
- Training data quantity vs quality
- Inference speed vs accuracy

**Failure Signatures**:
- Performance degradation on out-of-domain data
- Overfitting to domain-specific jargon
- Computational resource exhaustion
- Bias amplification in specialized domains
- Transfer learning ineffectiveness across domains

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Benchmark BioBERT vs BERT on biomedical sentence classification using standard datasets
2. Compare different fine-tuning strategies (full fine-tuning, adapter-based, prompt-based) on SciBERT
3. Evaluate cross-domain transfer learning performance between biomedical and financial domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The review identifies several open questions regarding the scalability of domain-specific PLMs to new specialized domains, the effectiveness of cross-domain transfer learning, and the development of more efficient fine-tuning techniques. The paper also questions how to address computational limitations for resource-constrained applications and how to mitigate ethical concerns around bias in domain-specific models. Additionally, it raises questions about standardizing evaluation protocols across different specialized domains and developing automated methods for domain adaptation.

## Limitations
- Limited quantitative synthesis of performance metrics across studies
- Potential publication bias toward positive results in selected articles
- Incomplete coverage of emerging domains and specialized applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Domain-specific PLMs significantly outperform general-purpose models for specialized text classification tasks, supported by multiple empirical studies.

**Medium confidence**: Reported performance metrics across heterogeneous datasets and experimental conditions, as quantitative synthesis was not conducted.

**Low confidence**: Generalizability beyond covered domains (biomedical, finance, scientific literature) due to limited coverage of other specialized fields.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct meta-analysis of F1 scores and other performance metrics across the 41 studies to establish statistically significant differences between domain-specific and general-purpose models
2. Perform standardized computational cost benchmarking of BioBERT, SciBERT, and other PLMs across multiple hardware configurations and dataset sizes
3. Design controlled experiments testing cross-domain transfer learning capabilities, specifically examining model performance when trained on one specialized domain and evaluated on another
