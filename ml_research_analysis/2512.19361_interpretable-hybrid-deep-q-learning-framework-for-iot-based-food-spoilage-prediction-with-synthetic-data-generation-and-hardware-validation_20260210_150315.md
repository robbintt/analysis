# Interpretable Hybrid Deep Q-Learning Framework for IoT-Based Food Spoilage Prediction with Synthetic Data Generation and Hardware Validation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19361
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Hybrid deep Q-learning framework combining LSTM, RNN, and rule-based classifier achieves 0.82 accuracy on synthetic data and 0.59 on real-time hardware data for food spoilage prediction

## Executive Summary
This research introduces an interpretable hybrid deep reinforcement learning framework for IoT-based food spoilage prediction. The system combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Deep Q-Networks, employing a rule-based classifier for interpretable spoilage thresholds and synthetic data generation from real-time sensor inputs. The framework demonstrates strong performance on synthetic data while maintaining reasonable accuracy in real-time hardware deployments. The approach bridges adaptive intelligence and interpretability, offering a scalable solution for intelligent food safety monitoring.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a hybrid architecture combining LSTM and RNN networks with Deep Q-Learning for food spoilage prediction. A rule-based classifier provides interpretable spoilage thresholds, while synthetic data generation techniques create training data from real-time sensor inputs including temperature, humidity, and gas emissions. The system is evaluated using both synthetic and real-time hardware data, with performance metrics focusing on interpretability-driven measures such as reward-to-step ratio, loss decrease rate, and exploration decay.

## Key Results
- LSTM+RNN agent outperforms alternative models with spoilage accuracy of 0.82 on synthetic data
- Real-time hardware validation achieves accuracy of 0.59, demonstrating practical deployment potential
- Interpretability metrics (reward-to-step ratio, loss decrease rate, exploration decay) demonstrate robust learning dynamics and decision transparency
- Framework successfully bridges adaptive intelligence and interpretability for food safety monitoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid architecture leverages the sequential learning capabilities of LSTM and RNN networks to capture temporal patterns in sensor data, while Deep Q-Learning provides reinforcement-based decision making for spoilage prediction. The rule-based classifier adds interpretability by establishing clear spoilage thresholds based on sensor readings. Synthetic data generation addresses data scarcity issues by augmenting real sensor inputs with realistic variations, enabling more robust model training.

## Foundational Learning

1. Deep Q-Learning
   - Why needed: Provides reinforcement-based decision making for sequential spoilage prediction tasks
   - Quick check: Verify Q-value convergence and policy stability during training

2. LSTM and RNN Networks
   - Why needed: Capture temporal dependencies in sensor data streams for accurate spoilage detection
   - Quick check: Validate sequence learning with time-series sensor data patterns

3. Synthetic Data Generation
   - Why needed: Addresses data scarcity by creating realistic training data from limited real sensor inputs
   - Quick check: Compare statistical properties of synthetic vs. real data distributions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Sensor Data -> Synthetic Data Generator -> LSTM+RNN Agent -> Deep Q-Network -> Rule-based Classifier -> Spoilage Prediction

Critical Path: Real-time sensor inputs are processed through synthetic data generation, fed into the LSTM+RNN agent for temporal pattern recognition, reinforced through Deep Q-Learning, and interpreted via rule-based classification to produce spoilage predictions.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Interpretability vs. accuracy: Rule-based classifier provides transparency but may limit model complexity
- Synthetic vs. real data: Synthetic generation addresses data scarcity but may introduce distribution mismatch
- LSTM+RNN combination vs. single architecture: Increased computational complexity for potentially improved performance

Failure Signatures:
- Performance degradation on real-time data vs. synthetic data indicates distribution mismatch
- Inconsistent interpretability metrics suggest unstable decision boundaries
- High variance in reward-to-step ratio indicates unstable learning dynamics

First Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison: Evaluate single LSTM vs. RNN vs. hybrid performance on synthetic data
2. Interpretability validation: Compare rule-based classification accuracy against human expert judgment
3. Real-time deployment: Test framework on diverse food types and storage conditions
