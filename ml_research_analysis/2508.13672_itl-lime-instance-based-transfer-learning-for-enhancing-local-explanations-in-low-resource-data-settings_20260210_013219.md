# ITL-LIME: Instance-Based Transfer Learning for Enhancing Local Explanations in Low-Resource Data Settings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.13672
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13672
- **Authors**: Rehan Raza; Guanjin Wang; Kok Wai Wong; Hamid Laga; Marco Fisichella
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: ITL-LIME achieves up to 9.6% higher AUC and 100% stability (Jaccard Coefficient) compared to baseline LIME methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the instability and low fidelity of LIME explanations in low-resource data settings where data scarcity leads to unrealistic synthetic samples. The authors propose ITL-LIME, a novel framework that leverages instance-based transfer learning to improve explanation quality. Instead of generating random perturbations, ITL-LIME retrieves real instances from a related source domain that are most similar to the target instance, combines them with neighboring target instances, and uses a contrastive learning-based encoder to assign proximity-based weights to these combined instances. This weighted set is then used to train a local surrogate model. Experimental results on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that ITL-LIME significantly improves both the fidelity and stability of LIME explanations compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
ITL-LIME improves LIME explanations by replacing synthetic perturbation generation with instance-based transfer learning. The framework partitions the source domain using K-medoids clustering, retrieves instances from the most similar and label-consistent source cluster, and combines these with target instance neighbors. A SCARF-based contrastive encoder is trained on this combined neighborhood to learn a similarity embedding space, from which proximity weights are computed using an exponential kernel. These weights are then used to train a linear surrogate model for local explanation. The method is evaluated on Diabetes and Student Depression datasets using black-box models including Gaussian SVM and Deep Neural Network, with performance measured by fidelity (F1-score, AUC), stability (Jaccard Coefficient), and robustness (Local Lipschitz Estimator).

## Key Results
- ITL-LIME achieves up to 9.6% higher AUC compared to baseline LIME methods
- Perfect 100% stability (Jaccard Coefficient) across multiple runs for both datasets and models
- Significant improvements in Local Lipschitz robustness metric for low-resource settings
- Consistent performance gains across different black-box models (G-LIBSVM and DNN)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by addressing the fundamental weakness of traditional LIME: synthetic perturbations in low-resource settings often fall outside the true data manifold, leading to poor surrogate model training. By retrieving real instances from a related source domain that are structurally similar to the target instance, ITL-LIME ensures that the local neighborhood used for explanation generation lies on the actual data manifold. The contrastive encoder further refines this by learning a similarity metric that captures meaningful relationships between instances, allowing for more appropriate weighting of the neighborhood samples.

## Foundational Learning

**K-medoids clustering**: Why needed - To partition the source domain into meaningful clusters for efficient instance retrieval. Quick check - Verify silhouette score indicates good clustering quality (ideally >0.5).

**Contrastive learning (SCARF)**: Why needed - To learn a similarity embedding that captures meaningful relationships between instances across domains. Quick check - Monitor encoder loss convergence and ensure similar instances have higher cosine similarity in embedding space.

**Exponential kernel weighting**: Why needed - To assign appropriate importance to instances based on their proximity to the target in the learned embedding space. Quick check - Verify weight distribution is smooth and highest weights correspond to closest instances.

**Local surrogate modeling**: Why needed - To approximate the black-box model's behavior in the local neighborhood for interpretable explanations. Quick check - Ensure surrogate model achieves high fidelity (F1/AUC close to black-box) on the weighted neighborhood.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Source Clustering -> Instance Retrieval -> Neighborhood Combination -> Contrastive Encoder Training -> Proximity Weight Calculation -> Surrogate Model Training

**Critical path**: The most critical path is Instance Retrieval combined with Contrastive Encoder Training, as these directly determine the quality of the local neighborhood used for explanation generation.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity (additional contrastive encoder training per instance) for improved explanation quality. This is justified in low-resource settings where explanation accuracy is critical.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance manifests as low fidelity scores (surrogate F1/AUC much lower than black-box) or unstable explanations (low Jaccard Coefficient across runs). This typically indicates either poor instance retrieval (wrong source cluster) or encoder training issues.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Verify K-medoids clustering produces meaningful partitions by checking silhouette scores and cluster visualizations
2. Test instance retrieval accuracy by manually inspecting retrieved source instances for several target cases
3. Validate contrastive encoder learns meaningful similarities by checking nearest neighbors in embedding space

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit limitations include: how to automatically determine optimal source-to-target instance ratios, handling of highly heterogeneous source domains, and scalability to very large source datasets.

## Limitations

- **Computational overhead**: The contrastive encoder training per instance adds significant computational cost compared to standard LIME
- **Domain similarity requirement**: Performance depends on having a source domain that is sufficiently similar to the target domain
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Results may be sensitive to the choice of K in K-medoids and the ratio parameter ξ

## Confidence

**Fidelity improvements (AUC/F1)**: High - Results are consistent across datasets and models with clear statistical significance
**Stability improvements (Jaccard)**: Medium - Perfect 100% stability seems unusually high and may depend on implementation details
**Computational efficiency**: Low - The paper does not report runtime comparisons with baseline methods
**Generalizability**: Medium - Results are shown only on two healthcare datasets with specific black-box models

## Next Checks

1. **Distance metric validation**: Test Gower distance implementation with the same dataset characteristics (numerical/categorical feature ratios) as the original Diabetes and Student Depression datasets to verify the reported results can be replicated

2. **Label consistency verification**: Determine whether label consistency uses ground truth or model predictions by comparing results on correctly vs. incorrectly classified instances to understand the impact on explanation quality

3. **Neighborhood size sensitivity**: Run ablation studies with different neighborhood sizes (varying k and ξ) to confirm the reported optimal configuration is robust and not overfitted to specific parameter choices
