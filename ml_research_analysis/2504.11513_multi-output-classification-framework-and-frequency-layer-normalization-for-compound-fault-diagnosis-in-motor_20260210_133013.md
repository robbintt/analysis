# Multi-output Classification Framework and Frequency Layer Normalization for Compound Fault Diagnosis in Motor

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.11513
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11513
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: MOC framework achieves average macro F1 score of 0.874 vs 0.848 for baseline multi-class classification

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of compound fault diagnosis in rotating machinery under domain adaptation conditions with partially labeled target domains. The proposed multi-output classification (MOC) framework independently estimates the severity of each fault type using task-specific layers, improving interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. The framework integrates multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) and entropy minimization (EM) losses for feature transfer, and introduces frequency layer normalization (FLN) to preserve spectral characteristics in the frequency domain. Experimental results across six domain adaptation scenarios show that MOC achieves higher macro F1 scores (average 0.874) compared to baseline multi-class classification (average 0.848). FLN also outperforms conventional normalization methods in adaptability and classification performance.

## Method Summary
The method proposes a multi-output classification framework for compound fault diagnosis under domain adaptation conditions. The approach uses task-specific layers to independently estimate fault severity for each fault type, improving interpretability compared to traditional multi-class classification. Feature transfer is achieved through multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) and entropy minimization (EM) losses. A novel frequency layer normalization (FLN) is introduced to preserve spectral characteristics in the frequency domain. The framework is evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios using the CWRU bearing dataset, demonstrating improved macro F1 scores and adaptability compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- MOC framework achieves average macro F1 score of 0.874 across six domain adaptation scenarios
- Baseline multi-class classification achieves average macro F1 score of 0.848
- FLN outperforms conventional normalization methods in adaptability and classification performance
- Task-specific layers in MOC improve interpretability by separately estimating fault severity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MOC framework improves compound fault diagnosis by independently estimating each fault type's severity through task-specific layers, allowing the model to capture fault-specific patterns more effectively than traditional multi-class classification. The MK-MMD loss minimizes domain shift by aligning feature distributions between source and target domains, while EM loss encourages confident predictions on unlabeled target data. FLN preserves spectral characteristics in the frequency domain, which is critical for maintaining discriminative features in motor fault diagnosis where frequency components carry diagnostic information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain Adaptation**: Transferring knowledge from labeled source domain to unlabeled/partially labeled target domain - needed to handle real-world scenarios where target domain data lacks labels; quick check: verify domain shift reduction using MK-MMD metrics
- **Multi-output Classification**: Independent estimation of multiple fault types rather than single multi-class output - needed for compound fault scenarios where multiple faults can occur simultaneously; quick check: compare performance against multi-class baseline
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Processing signals in frequency domain to capture spectral characteristics - needed because motor faults manifest as specific frequency components; quick check: validate FLN preserves key frequency features
- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**: Statistical measure for domain alignment - needed to quantify and minimize domain shift between source and target; quick check: measure MMD reduction after alignment
- **Entropy Minimization**: Encouraging confident predictions on unlabeled data - needed to leverage partially labeled target data effectively; quick check: monitor prediction entropy on target domain

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw Signal -> FFT -> Feature Extractor -> Task-specific Layers (one per fault type) -> MK-MMD Loss + EM Loss -> Classification Output

**Critical Path**: Feature extraction from frequency domain -> Task-specific severity estimation -> Domain adaptation losses -> Final classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: Task-specific layers increase model complexity but improve interpretability and performance; FLN adds computational overhead but preserves critical spectral information; domain adaptation losses require careful hyperparameter tuning

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when domain shift is too large for MK-MMD to handle; FLN may fail if frequency components are not discriminative; task-specific layers may overfit if training data is insufficient

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare MOC with and without domain adaptation losses to quantify their contribution; 2) Test FLN against other normalization methods on the same framework; 3) Evaluate model performance on completely unlabeled target domains to test robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on single public dataset (CWRU bearing dataset) without validation on additional datasets
- Limited domain adaptation scenarios (six combinations) may not represent real-world variability
- FLN lacks comparative analysis with other frequency-domain normalization techniques
- Computational efficiency and real-time implementation considerations not addressed

## Confidence
- High confidence in MOC framework's ability to improve macro F1 scores over multi-class classification in tested scenarios
- Medium confidence in FLN's superiority over conventional normalization methods due to limited comparative analysis
- Low confidence in generalizability to other fault types or machinery given single dataset validation

## Next Checks
1) Test the framework on additional public datasets (e.g., IMS bearing dataset, Paderborn dataset) to verify generalizability
2) Implement ablation studies removing MK-MMD and EM losses to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains
3) Conduct real-time implementation tests on embedded systems to evaluate computational efficiency and inference latency under practical constraints
