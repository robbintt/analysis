core_contribution: The paper introduces the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM) to address
  bias in image generation by Stable Diffusion models, which inherit and amplify societal
  biases from training data. DDM employs a novel latent representation learning indicator
  that operates independently of predefined sensitive attributes, aiming to produce
  fairer outputs by decoupling these attributes from learned representations.

# Debiasing Diffusion Model: Enhancing Fairness through Latent Representation Learning in Stable Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts

- Introduces DDM to reduce bias in SD image generation via latent representation learning without predefined sensitive attributes

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the Debiasing Diffusion Model (DDM), a method to reduce bias in Stable Diffusion image generation by learning fairer latent representations without relying on predefined sensitive attributes. DDM integrates a novel latent representation learning indicator into the training process, which helps decouple sensitive attributes from generated images while maintaining generation quality. The approach shows promising results in reducing fairness discrepancies across demographic groups in both face and digit generation tasks, though a trade-off between fairness and image quality is observed.

## Method Summary
DDM fine-tunes Stable Diffusion models using LoRA with a combined loss function that balances the original diffusion loss with an indicator loss. The indicator module, consisting of three fully connected layers, takes denoised latent outputs and predicts whether they belong to the target or non-target class. During training, both the indicator and denoising U-Net are updated jointly, with the indicator encouraging the model to learn representations less dependent on sensitive attributes. The method uses a target dataset (80/20 split of biased groups) and a non-target dataset (100 ImageNet images) to train the indicator, with the non-target data helping establish a baseline for unbiased representation learning.

## Key Results
- DDM effectively reduces Fairness Discrepancy (FD) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) across demographic groups
- Trade-off observed between fairness improvements and image quality, with higher debiasing strength sometimes reducing generation fidelity
- Successfully demonstrates attribute-independent bias mitigation without requiring predefined sensitive attributes
- Validated across both gender-balanced face generation and digit generation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DDM works by introducing an indicator module that learns to predict whether generated latents belong to target or non-target classes. By optimizing this indicator jointly with the denoising U-Net, the model is encouraged to produce representations that are less dependent on sensitive attributes. The indicator acts as a regularizer, pushing the model to learn features that are more generalizable and less biased. The use of non-target data provides a reference distribution that helps the model understand what unbiased representations look like, making the debiasing process more effective without requiring explicit attribute labels.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent Diffusion Models**: Understand how diffusion models operate in latent space rather than pixel space; needed to grasp where and how DDM intervenes in the generation process
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Learn how Low-Rank Adaptation modifies model weights efficiently; needed to understand the practical implementation of DDM
- **Fairness Metrics (FD/SPD)**: Grasp Statistical Parity Difference and Fairness Discrepancy calculations; needed to evaluate the effectiveness of bias reduction
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Understand binary classification loss for the indicator; needed to follow the training objective
- **Evaluation Metrics (FID/IS)**: Know how Fréchet Inception Distance and Inception Score measure generation quality; needed to assess the fairness-quality trade-off

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Target Dataset -> Indicator Module -> Combined Loss -> LoRA-Adapted U-Net -> Generated Images
- **Critical Path**: The indicator module sits between the denoising U-Net output and the loss calculation, influencing how the U-Net learns to denoise latents
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing debiasing strength (α) against generation quality; using non-target data increases dataset requirements but enables attribute-independent debiasing
- **Failure Signatures**: High α values causing degraded image quality (increased FID, unrecognizable outputs); indicator learning to use sensitive attributes as shortcuts despite regularization
- **First Experiments**: 1) Train with varying α values to map fairness-quality trade-off; 2) Test indicator performance with different non-target dataset compositions; 3) Evaluate subgroup entropy to detect shortcut learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Adaptive Debiasing Strength**: How to dynamically adjust α during training to prevent quality degradation observed with static high values
- **Maintaining Fidelity**: How to modify the indicator to preserve image texture and detail while enforcing statistical parity
- **Non-Target Dataset Impact**: Whether the specific semantic content of the non-target dataset influences debiasing effectiveness or if its mere presence is sufficient
- **Continuous Attributes**: How the method performs with sensitive attributes on continuous spectrums rather than discrete binary categories

## Limitations
- Trade-off between fairness improvements and generation quality, with higher debiasing strength degrading image fidelity
- Reliance on non-target dataset doubles data requirements and introduces uncertainty about optimal composition
- Current method designed for binary/categorical attributes, limiting application to continuous or intersectional biases
- Lack of adaptive mechanism for dynamically adjusting debiasing strength during training

## Confidence
- **High**: Problem framing and general methodology clearly articulated
- **Medium**: Experimental design reproducible in principle, but missing hyperparameters limit precise replication
- **Low**: Specific architectural and training details required for exact reproduction are absent

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test indicator modules with varying hidden layer sizes and input feature dimensions to determine sensitivity of fairness gains
2. Conduct grid searches over α, learning rates, and batch sizes to map the fairness-quality trade-off space
3. Compute subgroup mean entropy and correlate with sensitive attributes post-training to verify the indicator doesn't exploit protected features
