# How Data Quality Affects Machine Learning Models for Credit Risk Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10964
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: Machine learning model robustness varies significantly with data quality type and severity in credit risk assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how data quality issues impact the performance of machine learning models in credit risk assessment. Using a credit risk dataset, the study systematically introduces controlled data corruption across five dimensions (duplicates, noise, outliers, missing values, and label errors) using the PuckTrick library. Ten common ML models are evaluated on both clean and corrupted training data. Surprisingly, some models perform better with certain types of noise, while others degrade significantly. The study reveals that model robustness varies with both the type and severity of data imperfections, offering practical insights for practitioners to build more resilient credit risk models in real-world settings.

## Method Summary
The study uses a credit risk dataset and systematically introduces controlled data corruption across five dimensions using the PuckTrick library. Ten common machine learning models are evaluated on both clean and corrupted training data. The research employs a controlled experimental design where specific types of data quality issues (duplicates, noise, outliers, missing values, and label errors) are introduced at varying severity levels. Model performance is measured and compared across different corruption scenarios to identify patterns of robustness and vulnerability.

## Key Results
- Some machine learning models actually perform better with certain types of noise in credit risk datasets
- Model robustness varies significantly with both the type and severity of data imperfections
- Performance degradation is not uniform across different ML models when exposed to the same data quality issues

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying these findings relates to how different ML algorithms respond to data imperfections. Some models, particularly those with inherent regularization or robustness properties, can actually benefit from certain types of noise that act as implicit regularization. Conversely, models sensitive to data distribution shifts or outliers experience significant performance degradation. The study demonstrates that the relationship between data quality and model performance is complex and non-linear, with different models exhibiting distinct patterns of resilience or vulnerability to specific types of data corruption.

## Foundational Learning
- **Data corruption types**: Understanding the five main categories of data quality issues (duplicates, noise, outliers, missing values, label errors) and their distinct impacts on ML models. Why needed: Different corruption types affect model learning mechanisms differently. Quick check: Can identify and classify each corruption type in a sample dataset.
- **Model robustness metrics**: Ability to measure and compare model performance across varying data quality conditions. Why needed: Essential for quantifying the impact of data imperfections. Quick check: Can calculate performance metrics on both clean and corrupted datasets.
- **Synthetic data corruption**: Techniques for systematically introducing controlled data quality issues. Why needed: Enables reproducible experiments on data quality impacts. Quick check: Can use PuckTrick or similar tools to introduce specific corruption types.
- **Credit risk assessment fundamentals**: Understanding the domain-specific requirements and evaluation metrics for credit risk models. Why needed: Ensures relevance of findings to real-world applications. Quick check: Can explain key performance metrics in credit risk context.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Performance Evaluation -> Analysis
Critical path: Clean data preparation -> Controlled corruption introduction -> Model training -> Performance comparison
Design tradeoffs: Synthetic corruption vs. real-world data imperfections; controlled experiments vs. ecological validity
Failure signatures: Performance degradation patterns specific to corruption types; unexpected improvements due to implicit regularization
First experiments: 1) Test single corruption type at low severity; 2) Compare two different model families on same corruption; 3) Analyze performance on mixed corruption scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study uses synthetic data corruption rather than real-world data quality issues, which may not fully capture the complexity and interdependencies of actual data imperfections in credit risk datasets.
- The controlled introduction of specific corruption types provides clean experimental conditions but may oversimplify real-world scenarios where multiple quality issues co-occur and interact.
- The paper lacks investigation into how data quality issues affect model interpretability and explainability, which are critical considerations in credit risk assessment where decisions must be justified.

## Confidence
- Model performance varies with data quality type: High
- Some models benefit from certain noise types: Medium
- Practical implications for real-world credit risk modeling: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using real-world credit risk datasets with naturally occurring data quality issues to validate findings from synthetic corruption experiments
2. Test additional robust learning methods and ensemble approaches specifically designed to handle data imperfections to assess their performance relative to standard ML models
3. Conduct a longitudinal study to examine how model performance changes over time as data quality evolves in production credit risk assessment systems
