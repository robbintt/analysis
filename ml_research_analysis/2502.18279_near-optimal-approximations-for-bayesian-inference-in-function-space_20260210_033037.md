# Near-Optimal Approximations for Bayesian Inference in Function Space
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18279
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18279
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Projected Langevin Sampling (PLS) provides near-optimal scalable Bayesian inference in RKHS with O(M³ + JM²) complexity

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Projected Langevin Sampling (PLS), a scalable algorithm for Bayesian inference of functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). PLS approximates the Bayes posterior by projecting an infinite-dimensional Langevin diffusion onto the first M components of the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion, resulting in an M-dimensional diffusion that can be efficiently simulated. The method achieves favorable computational scaling and provides theoretical guarantees, including exponential convergence rates for certain kernel classes.

## Method Summary
PLS works by projecting the infinite-dimensional Langevin diffusion onto the first M components of the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion of the GP prior. This projection yields an M-dimensional diffusion that approximates the original infinite-dimensional process. The algorithm then simulates this finite-dimensional diffusion and maps the samples back to function space using the law of total probability. The computational complexity scales as O(M³ + JM²), where J is the number of samples and M is the projection dimension. Theoretical analysis shows that PLS is provably close to the optimal M-dimensional variational approximation of the Bayes posterior for convex and Lipschitz continuous negative log likelihoods, with discrepancy decaying at least as O(M⁻¹), and even exponentially O(exp(−M)) for certain kernel classes.

## Key Results
- PLS achieves computational complexity of O(M³ + JM²), favorable compared to full GP inference
- Theoretical guarantees include O(M⁻¹) discrepancy decay for convex/Lipschitz likelihoods, with exponential O(exp(−M)) decay for specific kernel classes
- Empirically competitive with sparse variational Gaussian processes while handling non-Gaussian likelihoods and multimodal posteriors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PLS leverages the structure of RKHS and the Karhunen-Loève expansion to project infinite-dimensional inference problems onto finite-dimensional subspaces. By carefully choosing the projection dimension M and exploiting the properties of Langevin diffusion in function space, the method maintains theoretical guarantees while achieving computational efficiency. The projection approach naturally handles the infinite-dimensional nature of GP posteriors while providing a principled approximation framework.

## Foundational Learning
- Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS): Function spaces with special properties that allow kernel methods to work; needed to understand the mathematical foundation of GPs
- Karhunen-Loève expansion: Spectral decomposition of stochastic processes; needed to understand how to project infinite-dimensional processes onto finite-dimensional subspaces
- Langevin dynamics in function space: Stochastic differential equations for sampling from distributions; needed to understand the sampling mechanism in infinite dimensions
- Variational inference: Approximate Bayesian inference framework; needed to understand the connection between PLS and optimal variational approximations
- Convex analysis: Mathematical framework for optimization; needed for theoretical guarantees about approximation quality

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion -> Projection -> Finite-dimensional Langevin diffusion -> Sampling -> Back-mapping to function space

**Critical path:** KL divergence minimization via optimal projection -> Finite-dimensional sampling -> Posterior approximation

**Design tradeoffs:** Projection dimension M vs. computational cost (M³ scaling) vs. approximation quality

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on non-convex likelihoods, computational bottlenecks for large M, degradation in high-dimensional input spaces

**First experiments:**
1. Test PLS on simple 1D regression with Gaussian likelihood to verify basic functionality
2. Compare PLS approximation quality vs. M for a fixed kernel class
3. Benchmark PLS against SVGPs on a standard GP regression dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees assume convex and Lipschitz negative log likelihoods, limiting applicability to many real-world scenarios
- M³ computational scaling may still be prohibitive for very large function spaces
- Performance on high-dimensional input spaces and non-stationary kernels not thoroughly explored
- Empirical validation limited to few benchmark datasets without comprehensive comparison to state-of-the-art methods

## Confidence
- Theoretical claims for convex/Lipschitz case: High
- General applicability beyond convex/Lipschitz assumptions: Medium
- Empirical results across diverse scenarios: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test PLS on non-convex likelihoods and multimodal posteriors beyond simple cases shown
2. Benchmark against other scalable GP methods (inducing point methods, stochastic variational inference) on larger, more diverse datasets
3. Evaluate performance and computational efficiency in high-dimensional input spaces and with non-stationary kernels
