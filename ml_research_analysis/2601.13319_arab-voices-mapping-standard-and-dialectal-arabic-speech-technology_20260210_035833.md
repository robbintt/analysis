# Arab Voices: Mapping Standard and Dialectal Arabic Speech Technology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13319
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13319
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Arab Voices, a standardized framework for evaluating and benchmarking dialectal Arabic speech recognition systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Arab Voices, a standardized framework for evaluating and benchmarking dialectal Arabic speech recognition systems. The authors curate and harmonize 31 heterogeneous datasets spanning 14 Arabic dialects, resolving inconsistencies in dialect labeling and metadata. They characterize each dataset using automated measures of dialectness and audio quality, and conduct a human-in-the-loop validation. A standardized benchmark with per-dialect adaptation splits is established. Benchmarking of 14 recent ASR models reveals strong performance by Omnilingual LLM 7B (e.g., WER 23.5% on Levantine Arabic) and Qwen3 (e.g., WER 28.8% on Egyptian Arabic), while highlighting remaining challenges, particularly for North African and Iraqi varieties. The work underscores the need for richer metadata, standardized evaluation, and further data collection for low-resource dialects.

## Method Summary
The authors curate and harmonize 31 heterogeneous Arabic speech datasets spanning 14 dialects, resolving inconsistencies in dialect labeling and metadata. Datasets are standardized to mono 16kHz/16-bit PCM audio. Automated measures of dialectness and audio quality are computed for each dataset, followed by human-in-the-loop validation. A standardized benchmark is established with per-dialect adaptation splits (5 hours adaptation, 1 hour dev, 1 hour test). Fourteen pre-trained ASR models are evaluated zero-shot, applying text normalization (removing diacritics, normalizing characters like Ta-Marbuta to Ha) before scoring WER/CER.

## Key Results
- Omnilingual LLM 7B achieves the lowest WER (23.5%) on Levantine Arabic and strong performance across other dialects.
- Qwen3 shows competitive results, with WER 28.8% on Egyptian Arabic.
- Persistent challenges remain for North African and Iraqi dialect varieties.
- Automated audio-quality proxies (PESQ, STOI, SI-SDR, NMR-MOS) do not consistently track human judgments or ASR performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by harmonizing heterogeneous dialectal datasets into a unified evaluation schema, enabling apples-to-apples comparison of ASR models across dialects. By curating 31 datasets and creating standardized per-dialect splits, the authors eliminate confounding variables like inconsistent metadata and labeling. Automated dialectness and audio-quality measures allow rapid dataset characterization, while human validation ensures reliability. Zero-shot benchmarking of diverse ASR architectures (Whisper, MMS, SeamlessM4T, Omnilingual, Qwen3) reveals relative strengths and weaknesses, guiding future research toward low-resource dialect modeling.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dialect Identification (DI)**: Needed to map utterances to their correct dialect label for fair evaluation. Quick check: Verify that dialect labels are consistent across all 31 datasets and match human-annotated references.
- **Text Normalization (N(x))**: Required to remove diacritics and normalize orthographic variants (e.g., Ta-Marbuta → Ha) before scoring WER/CER. Quick check: Apply normalization to a small sample of reference and hypothesis texts and confirm consistency.
- **Zero-shot ASR Evaluation**: Core method to assess pre-trained models without fine-tuning, isolating model capability from adaptation effects. Quick check: Run inference on a held-out test set and confirm that no model weights are updated during evaluation.
- **Audio Standardization (16kHz/mono PCM)**: Ensures consistent input format across datasets, avoiding performance variance due to sampling rate or channel differences. Quick check: Verify that all audio files in the test set have the same format before inference.
- **Per-dialect Adaptation Splits**: Enables controlled evaluation by providing dialect-specific adaptation data, preventing overfitting to high-resource dialects. Quick check: Confirm that adaptation, dev, and test sets are disjoint and dialect-balanced.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Raw datasets → Standardization (audio, metadata) → Dialectness/Audio-quality characterization → Human validation → Standardized splits → Model inference → Text normalization → WER/CER scoring
- **Critical Path**: Raw datasets → Standardization → Splits → Model inference → Scoring
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Zero-shot evaluation avoids fine-tuning costs but may underutilize in-domain adaptation; automated quality proxies are fast but less reliable than human judgments; text normalization improves comparability but may obscure orthographic dialect markers.
- **Failure Signatures**: Whisper producing excessively long outputs (WER > 200) indicates hallucination or termination failure; mismatched text normalization inflates error rates; inconsistent dialect labels cause unfair evaluation.
- **First Experiments**: 1) Run inference on a single dialect’s test set to verify pipeline integrity; 2) Compare normalized vs. unnormalized WER to confirm normalization impact; 3) Cross-validate automated dialectness scores against human annotations on a sample.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can an audio-based “spoken ALDi” be developed to measure dialectal intensity directly from speech signals, capturing pronunciation differences that text-based metrics miss?
- How do predicted audio-quality measures (PESQ, STOI, SI-SDR, NMR-MOS) correlate with downstream ASR performance across diverse Arabic dialects?
- Can language models designed for CTC decoding substantially improve Arabic ASR performance, particularly for low-resource dialects?

## Limitations
- Exact model inference parameters (beam size, temperature, checkpoints) are not fully specified, introducing potential variability in reproduced results.
- Many curated datasets are subject to LDC or other institutional licenses, limiting open reproduction.
- Automated audio-quality proxies do not consistently track human judgments or correlate with ASR performance, limiting their utility for dataset selection.

## Confidence
- **High**: Benchmark framework design, dialect-specific split quality, general model ranking trends.
- **Medium**: Exact numerical WER/CER scores due to unspecified inference parameters and normalization nuances.

## Next Checks
1. Verify that the exact model checkpoints and inference parameters (beam size, temperature, etc.) used in the original experiments are retrievable and reproducible from public repositories.
2. Confirm that the text normalization pipeline N(x) is applied consistently in both hypothesis generation and reference scoring to avoid inflated error rates.
3. Test model inference on a small subset of the standardized splits to ensure no hallucination or termination failures (e.g., excessive WER spikes) occur for underrepresented dialects like Mesopotamian Arabic.
