# Post-Training Probability Manifold Correction via Structured SVD Pruning and Self-Referential Distillation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2602.00372
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00372
- **Reference count:** 33
- **Primary result:** 39% perplexity improvement from self-referential distillation alone on dense model; 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs

## Executive Summary
Sparse Knowledge Distillation (SparseKD) is a post-training method that combines structured SVD pruning with self-referential knowledge distillation to compress transformer models. The method teaches the model to match its own probability distribution from before compression, enabling quality recovery after aggressive pruning. Key results include 39% perplexity improvement from self-referential distillation alone on a dense model (Qwen3-0.6B), 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs, and 1.17x inference speedup at 65% sparsity on batch=64. The approach is pruning-method agnostic, works across different model scales (0.6B and 3.8B parameters), and requires no external teachers or architectural changes.

## Method Summary
SparseKD operates through a two-phase process: first, it caches the dense model's top-k=32 probability distributions on a calibration corpus; second, it applies SVD-based low-rank pruning to MLP weight matrices with tiered retention and trains the pruned model to match the cached distributions via KL divergence + cross-entropy loss (α=0.5). The method uses temperature scaling (T=1.5-3.0) and trains for 1-2 epochs with learning rates of 1e-5 to 5e-5 in bfloat16 precision. The approach is designed to be pruning-method agnostic and works iteratively for high sparsity levels.

## Key Results
- 39% perplexity improvement from self-referential distillation alone on dense model (Qwen3-0.6B)
- 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs
- 1.17x inference speedup at 65% sparsity on batch=64

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by preserving the probability manifold of the original dense model through self-referential distillation after structured pruning. By caching the dense model's probability distributions and training the pruned model to match them, SparseKD prevents catastrophic forgetting that typically occurs with aggressive compression. The structured SVD pruning reduces computational complexity while the distillation phase recovers lost information by aligning the compressed model's output distribution with the original.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structured SVD pruning**: Matrix factorization technique for low-rank approximation; needed to reduce MLP layer parameters while maintaining computational structure; quick check: verify rank retention thresholds preserve >95% energy
- **Knowledge distillation**: Teacher-student training paradigm; needed to transfer knowledge from dense to sparse model; quick check: ensure temperature scaling (T>1) is applied
- **Probability manifold**: The geometric structure of model output distributions; needed to understand what information is preserved during compression; quick check: visualize output distribution changes pre/post pruning
- **Tiered retention**: Layer-specific rank preservation strategy; needed to balance quality vs compression across different model depths; quick check: verify embedding-adjacent layers retain higher ranks than mid-layers

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Dense model -> Calibration corpus caching -> SVD pruning -> Self-referential KD training -> Sparse model
- **Critical path**: Probability caching → Structured pruning → KD training → Quality evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Quality vs compression ratio, speed vs accuracy, single-round vs iterative pruning
- **Failure signatures**: PPL explosion (>100×) post-pruning (expected, recoverable with KD), NaN losses during training (switch to bfloat16, reduce LR)
- **First experiments**: 1) Baseline PPL evaluation on WikiText-2 test; 2) SVD pruning with 15% target reduction; 3) Self-referential KD training and quality comparison

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two model scales (0.6B, 3.8B) and one task (perplexity on WikiText-2)
- SVD pruning only addresses MLP layers, leaving attention matrices uncompressed
- Quality improvements diminish at larger scales (39% vs 15% PPL improvement)
- Speedups are modest (1.17x at 65% sparsity) and depend entirely on feed-forward compression

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology is technically sound; empirical quality recovery results are reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: Method-agnostic claims lack empirical validation across diverse pruning techniques
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to larger models and other domains remains speculative

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test tiered rank retention with empirically determined per-layer thresholds to verify claimed compression range
2. Apply SparseKD to non-text generation tasks to validate cross-domain performance
3. Extend approach to include attention layer compression and measure combined impact on quality and speed
