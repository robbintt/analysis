# The Mind in the Machine: A Survey of Incorporating Psychological Theories in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.00003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00003
- Reference count: 40
- Systematic review of 227 papers mapping psychological theories to LLM development stages

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of how psychological theories are integrated across the LLM development lifecycle, examining 227 papers that span six psychological domains mapped onto four key stages of LLM development. The authors identify current trends in theory application, such as developmental psychology's use in preprocessing and behavioral psychology in reinforcement learning from human feedback, while highlighting significant gaps in exploring theories like Social Identity Theory and Schema Theory. The work addresses critical challenges including terminology mismatches between psychology and NLP communities and offers a structured framework to guide more thoughtful, theory-aligned integration of psychological insights into future LLM research. By systematically cataloging existing approaches and identifying under-explored opportunities, the survey aims to bridge disciplinary divides and advance more psychologically-informed AI systems.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology, using keyword-based retrieval from papers published between 2018-2024, followed by manual review of 227 papers. The authors map six psychological domains—developmental, cognitive, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and psycholinguistics—onto four LLM development stages: preprocessing, architecture design, training/inference, and applications. They employ a stage-wise framework for analysis, identifying current trends and gaps through cross-domain analysis. The methodology includes qualitative assessment of theoretical discrepancies and evaluation challenges at the intersection of psychology and NLP.

## Key Results
- Six psychological domains systematically mapped to four LLM development stages across 227 reviewed papers
- Developmental psychology predominantly used in preprocessing; behavioral psychology mainly applied in RLHF
- Three under-explored theories identified: Social Identity Theory, Schema Theory, and partial reinforcement schedules
- Terminology mismatches between psychology and NLP communities documented with specific examples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's systematic approach works by creating a structured framework that bridges two traditionally separate disciplines. By mapping psychological theories to specific LLM development stages, it reveals patterns in current practice and identifies gaps where psychological insights could enhance AI systems. The methodology leverages comprehensive literature review combined with cross-domain analysis to establish connections between theoretical frameworks and practical implementation strategies.

## Foundational Learning

**Psychological Domains (6 total)**
Why needed: Understanding the scope of psychological theories available for AI integration
Quick check: Can you name all six domains and their primary focus areas?

**LLM Development Stages (4 total)**
Why needed: Identifying where psychological theories can be applied in the AI pipeline
Quick check: What are the four stages and which psychological domains dominate each?

**Cross-Domain Mapping Framework**
Why needed: Creating systematic connections between psychology and NLP
Quick check: How does the framework handle theories that span multiple categories?

**Terminology Mismatches**
Why needed: Recognizing communication barriers between disciplines
Quick check: What are three specific examples of terminology conflicts identified?

**Under-Explored Theories**
Why needed: Identifying opportunities for novel research directions
Quick check: Which three theories are highlighted as particularly under-utilized?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Psychological Theories -> LLM Development Stages -> Integration Points -> Evaluation Methods

**Critical Path**
1. Identify relevant psychological theories
2. Map theories to appropriate development stages
3. Implement theory-aligned approaches
4. Evaluate effectiveness and address challenges

**Design Tradeoffs**
Theoretical fidelity vs. practical implementation constraints
Domain specificity vs. generalizability across applications
Complexity of psychological models vs. computational efficiency

**Failure Signatures**
Superficial integration without deep theoretical understanding
Misapplication due to terminology confusion
Evaluation methods that don't capture psychological validity

**3 First Experiments**
1. Test Schema Theory implementation in data preprocessing
2. Apply Social Identity Theory to improve model alignment
3. Experiment with partial reinforcement schedules in RLHF

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Keyword-based retrieval may miss relevant work using different terminology
- Manual review of 227 papers may not capture all approaches, particularly grey literature
- Categorization framework involves subjective decisions in mapping theories to stages
- Claims about under-explored theories rely on current publication trends rather than feasibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Six psychological domains mapping to four LLM stages is well-supported
- Developmental psychology in preprocessing and behavioral psychology in RLHF patterns are consistently evidenced
- Terminology mismatches between communities are clearly demonstrated

**Medium Confidence:**
- Under-explored theories' value is based on theoretical reasoning rather than empirical validation
- "Superficial" integration claims lack quantitative measures of depth or effectiveness

## Next Checks

1. Conduct citation network analysis to verify under-explored theories' minimal attention in LLM literature and their application in related AI/ML domains

2. Perform controlled experiment testing Schema Theory incorporation in LLM development stage compared to standard approaches

3. Execute terminology mapping study with domain experts from both psychology and NLP to create standardized reference guide for future research
