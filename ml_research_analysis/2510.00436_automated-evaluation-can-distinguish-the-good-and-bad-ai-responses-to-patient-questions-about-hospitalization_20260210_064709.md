# Automated Evaluation can Distinguish the Good and Bad AI Responses to Patient Questions about Hospitalization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00436
- Authors: Sarvesh Soni; Dina Demner-Fushman
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automated metrics, particularly BERTScore, reliably rank AI systems on patient-centered Q&A when compared against clinician-authored reference answers.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating AI-generated responses to patient questions about hospitalization, a task critical for ensuring safe and effective patient-clinician communication. Human expert review, while reliable, is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. The authors propose a systematic study comparing automated evaluation metrics with human judgments across three clinically relevant dimensions: whether responses answer the question, use clinical evidence appropriately, and incorporate general medical knowledge. They collected 2800 responses from 28 AI systems and annotated them using clinician-authored reference answers. Automated rankings closely matched expert ratings, particularly for semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore, suggesting that carefully designed automated evaluation can effectively scale comparative assessment of AI systems. This approach offers a practical, reliable alternative to human review, enabling rapid benchmarking and improving patient-centered medical AI evaluation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 28 AI systems on 100 patient questions about hospitalization from the ArchEHR-QA dataset, generating 2800 total responses. Each question includes a clinician-interpreted formulation and clinical note excerpt with sentence-level relevance labels. Three annotators (medical students) evaluate each response on three dimensions: answers-question, uses-evidence, and uses-knowledge. Two ranking methods reconcile annotations: Pyramid (sum of dimension scores) and MACE (automated competence estimation). Automated metrics compare system outputs against clinician-authored reference answers and evidence sentences, including BERTScore, ROUGE variants, SARI, BLEU, AlignScore, MEDCON, and citation F1. Kendall's τ correlation measures agreement between automated and human rankings at the system level.

## Key Results
- BERTScore against clinician-authored references showed strongest correlation with human rankings for answers-question (τ=0.56 with Pyramid; 0.52 with MACE)
- SARI and other text-overlap metrics correlated most strongly with human rankings for uses-evidence (τ=0.55-0.66)
- System-level rank correlations were consistently higher than item-level judgments, supporting automated evaluation for benchmarking

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semantic similarity metrics comparing AI outputs to clinician-authored reference answers can substitute for human evaluation when ranking systems on answer quality and knowledge use.
- Mechanism: BERTScore computes contextualized token embeddings for both generated and reference text, measuring cosine similarity while accounting for paraphrasing and synonymy. When the reference answer captures the clinically appropriate response, high semantic overlap indicates the system answered correctly.
- Core assumption: Clinician-authored reference answers represent valid gold-standard responses that encode what a "good" answer should contain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics, automated rankings closely matched expert ratings, particularly for semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore"
  - [Results] "For answers-question, metrics that compare system outputs to clinician-authored references yielded the strongest correspondence: BERTScore (human) (τ=0.56 with Pyramid; 0.52 with MACE)"
  - [corpus] The ASTRID paper notes similar challenges with automated RAG metrics in clinical contexts, though doesn't replicate this specific finding.
- Break condition: When no high-quality reference answers exist for a question type, or when valid responses diverge significantly from the single reference (multiple acceptable answers).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different evaluation dimensions require fundamentally different metric families—semantic metrics for answer quality, lexical overlap metrics for evidence integration.
- Mechanism: Lexical overlap metrics (SARI, BLEU, ROUGE-L) measure n-gram sharing between generated text and source evidence. For evidence use, these capture whether the system transformed and incorporated source sentences, while semantic metrics may assign high scores to fluent responses that ignore evidence.
- Core assumption: Evidence use is better captured by measuring text transformation from source material than by semantic similarity to a reference answer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Results] "The pattern reverses for uses-evidence, where text-overlap metrics correlate most strongly with human rankings: SARI (0.55–0.66), BLEU (0.31–0.44), and ROUGE-L (0.26–0.38)"
  - [Discussion] "text-based metrics (e.g., SARI) aligned more closely with our uses-evidence dimension than the dedicated citation-based F1 scores"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—neighbor papers don't directly address this dimension-specific metric alignment pattern.
- Break condition: When systems use architectural patterns that decouple citation selection from answer generation differently than the studied pipeline.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automated metrics are substantially more reliable for system-level rank-order comparison than for individual response assessment.
- Mechanism: Aggregating metric scores across 100 cases per system reduces variance and noise. Kendall's τ correlation measures ordinal agreement between metric-induced rankings and human-induced rankings, which is robust to scale differences and non-linear score relationships.
- Core assumption: The practical goal is comparative benchmarking (which system is better) rather than absolute quality scoring of individual responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Discussion] "we observed stronger correspondence at the system level than at the level of individual human scores, reinforcing that automatic metrics are more reliable for system-level comparisons than for item-level judgments"
  - [Discussion] "system-level rank correlations provide a concise indicator of metric utility"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support for this system-level vs. item-level distinction.
- Break condition: When evaluating a small number of cases (<20-30) where aggregation benefits diminish, or when item-level decisions (accept/reject individual responses) are required.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **BERTScore and embedding-based similarity**
  - Why needed here: Core metric driving the paper's strongest results for answers-question dimension; requires understanding contextual embeddings, token-level matching, and why it outperforms lexical overlap for semantic quality.
  - Quick check question: Given two sentences—"The patient has pneumonia" and "The patient was diagnosed with a lung infection"—would BERTScore rate these as similar? Would BLEU?

- Concept: **Kendall's τ rank correlation**
  - Why needed here: Paper's primary evaluation metric for comparing automated vs. human rankings; measures ordinal agreement rather than score correlation, which is critical for understanding benchmarking validity.
  - Quick check question: If System A scores [0.8, 0.6, 0.4] and System B scores [0.75, 0.55, 0.35] on three test cases, what does high Kendall's τ tell you that comparing mean scores would not?

- Concept: **MACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation)**
  - Why needed here: Paper uses MACE to reconcile 3 annotations per response into single labels; understanding this helps interpret label quality and the finding that robust ranking is possible with fewer annotations.
  - Quick check question: If three annotators disagree on a label [Yes, Partially, No], how does MACE differ from majority voting in producing a reconciled label?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Patient question -> Clinician-interpreted formulation -> Clinical note excerpt (with relevance labels) -> 28 AI systems (evidence selection -> answer generation -> citation assignment -> reformulation) -> System responses -> Clinician-authored reference answers -> Automated metrics (BERTScore, ROUGE, SARI, BLEU, AlignScore, MEDCON, Citation F1) -> System rankings -> Kendall's τ correlation with human rankings

- Critical path:
  1. Obtain clinician-authored reference answers for test questions (bottleneck—requires medical expertise)
  2. Collect system-generated responses (scales easily via API calls)
  3. Compute automated metrics against references and evidence
  4. Generate rankings and correlate with human judgment baseline
  5. **Key constraint**: Reference answers must exist before automated evaluation works; paper shows investing in reference creation (100 cases) enables scalable evaluation of unlimited systems

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Reference-based vs. reference-free**: Reference-based metrics (BERTScore vs. clinician answers) showed strongest correlations; reference-free metrics (vs. evidence sentences) performed worse for answers-question (τ=-0.40 to -0.32)
  - **Annotation budget**: MACE with only 1-2 annotations closely tracked full 3-annotation Pyramid rankings (τ=0.91-0.96), suggesting reduced annotation is viable
  - **Dimension coverage**: No single metric works across all dimensions—must select metric family based on what you're measuring

- Failure signatures:
  - **Wrong metric for dimension**: Using SARI for answers-question yields negative correlations (τ=-0.40); using BERTScore vs. evidence (not reference) also fails
  - **Missing reference answers**: Paper's approach requires clinician-authored answers; cannot evaluate novel question types without this investment
  - **Citation F1 overinterpretation**: Citation F1 correlated weaker than text metrics for evidence use (τ=0.33-0.39 vs. 0.55-0.66 for SARI)—high citation scores don't guarantee evidence integration

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Metric-dimension mapping validation**: On a held-out 20-case subset, compute all metrics against both reference answers and evidence sentences; verify that BERTScore(human) → answers-question and SARI → uses-evidence patterns replicate
  2. **Annotation budget threshold**: Run MACE with 1, 2, and 3 annotators on subset; confirm τ≥0.90 agreement threshold is reached with 2 annotators before reducing human labeling effort
  3. **Out-of-domain stress test**: Apply the metric selection strategy (BERTScore for answer quality, SARI for evidence use) to a different question type (e.g., medication questions vs. hospitalization questions); measure whether correlations degrade and by how much

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can large language model (LLM)-based evaluators ("LLM-as-a-judge") outperform semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore in correlating with human expert judgments for patient-centered question answering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that LLM-as-a-judge is an "emerging strand of metrics" with mixed results in healthcare, noting it is "an interesting direction for further investigations into automated evaluation."
- Why unresolved: The study focused on n-gram and embedding-based metrics; LLM-based evaluators were not included in the comparative analysis, leaving their specific efficacy for this task unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: A follow-up study correlating LLM-as-a-judge scores with the existing human expert rankings on the ArchEHR-QA dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can automated metrics be designed to specifically capture "evidence integration" within the generated narrative, distinct from simple citation selection fidelity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors found that citation-F1 scores correlated poorly with human judgments of "uses-evidence," likely because citation metrics reflect retrieval modules rather than how well the text leverages the evidence.
- Why unresolved: Current text-overlap metrics (e.g., SARI) act as better proxies for evidence use than specialized citation metrics, but they lack the granularity to distinguish between selecting evidence and effectively integrating it into the answer.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development and validation of a new metric that scores the semantic coherence between cited sentences and the generated answer claims, showing higher correlation with human "uses-evidence" labels than SARI.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the strong correlations observed between BERTScore and human rankings for hospitalization questions generalize to other clinical domains, such as preventative care or chronic disease management?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that metric choice is "often context-dependent" and limit their scope to hospitalization-related questions.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the finding—that semantic similarity to a reference answer is sufficient for evaluation—holds when the clinical context, and therefore the nature of "evidence," shifts significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the study's methodology on a dataset of outpatient or primary care questions to determine if BERTScore maintains high Kendall’s τ correlation with human rankings.

## Limitations

- The approach requires clinician-authored reference answers, creating a bottleneck for novel question types or clinical domains without this infrastructure.
- The study focuses on hospitalization questions and clinical notes, limiting generalizability to other medical contexts like preventative care or chronic disease management.
- The 28 AI systems represent a specific shared task cohort, potentially biasing findings toward particular architectural patterns and limiting external validity.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The system-level ranking methodology and Kendall's τ correlation framework are sound and well-established. The finding that semantic metrics work better for answer quality while lexical metrics work better for evidence integration is internally consistent.
- **Medium confidence**: The practical utility claim for automated evaluation as a substitute for human review assumes continued availability of clinician-authored reference answers and that the observed correlations hold across different clinical domains.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that automated metrics can replace human evaluation for item-level assessment lacks support, given the paper's own finding of stronger system-level vs. item-level correlations.

## Next Checks

1. **Reference answer sensitivity test**: Systematically vary the reference answer quality (e.g., use partial vs. complete clinician answers) and measure how correlation strength degrades for BERTScore on the answers-question dimension.
2. **Cross-domain transferability**: Apply the identified metric-dimension mapping (BERTScore for answer quality, SARI for evidence use) to a different clinical domain (e.g., medication or diagnostic questions) and measure correlation decay.
3. **Annotation budget optimization**: Conduct a controlled experiment varying the number of human annotations per response (1, 2, 3) and measure the point at which MACE-reconciled rankings drop below τ=0.90 agreement with full 3-annotator Pyramid scores.
