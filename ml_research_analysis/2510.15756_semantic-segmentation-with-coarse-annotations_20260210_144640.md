core_contribution: This paper proposes a regularization method to improve semantic

# Semantic segmentation with coarse annotations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.15756
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15756
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** Regularization method improves semantic segmentation boundary alignment when training on coarse annotations, achieving up to 60.3% improvement in boundary recall on SUIM dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a regularization method that enhances semantic segmentation performance when trained on coarse annotations. The approach encourages superpixels in encoder-decoder models with superpixel-based upsampling to align with SLIC-superpixels based on pixel color and position. The method is evaluated across three datasets (Cityscapes, PanNuke, SUIM) and demonstrates significant improvements in boundary recall and pixel accuracy, particularly on challenging cases where baseline models struggle with boundary alignment. The approach adds no inference time overhead and offers a practical solution for reducing annotation costs in semantic segmentation model development.

## Method Summary
The proposed method implements a regularization term that encourages superpixels in encoder-decoder segmentation models to align with SLIC-superpixels, which are computed independently of segmentation annotations based on pixel color and position. This regularization is applied to models with superpixel-based upsampling mechanisms, specifically targeting HCFCN-16 architecture. The method is evaluated across three datasets with varying annotation coarseness levels, demonstrating improved boundary alignment while maintaining or improving pixel accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning is performed for regularization strength and compactness to optimize performance.

## Key Results
- Boundary recall improved by up to 60.3% on SUIM dataset when trained on coarse annotations
- Pixel accuracy also improved on coarse annotations across all tested datasets
- Most effective on challenging datasets where baseline models struggle with boundary alignment
- No increase in inference time compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The regularization method works by encouraging the model to learn superpixel structures that align with SLIC-superpixels, which are based on inherent image characteristics (color and position) rather than segmentation annotations. This creates a stronger inductive bias that helps the model maintain consistent boundaries even when training annotations are coarse. By regularizing the upsampling process to follow natural image structures, the model can better generalize from incomplete annotation boundaries to produce more accurate segmentations.

## Foundational Learning

**SLIC-superpixels**: Region-based image segmentation method that groups pixels into perceptually meaningful atomic regions based on color and spatial proximity. *Why needed*: Provides a reference structure for regularization that's independent of annotation quality. *Quick check*: Verify SLIC implementation correctly segments images into coherent regions.

**Encoder-decoder architecture**: Neural network structure where encoder compresses spatial information while decoder reconstructs it for pixel-level predictions. *Why needed*: Enables the upsampling process that can be regularized. *Quick check*: Confirm skip connections properly preserve spatial information.

**Superpixel-based upsampling**: Upsampling technique that uses superpixel structures to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained predictions. *Why needed*: The regularization specifically targets this component. *Quick check*: Validate superpixel boundaries align with expected image structures.

**Regularization in segmentation**: Technique that adds constraints to model training to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. *Why needed*: Enables training on less precise annotations. *Quick check*: Monitor validation loss for signs of overfitting on coarse data.

**Boundary recall metric**: Evaluation metric measuring how well predicted boundaries align with ground truth boundaries. *Why needed*: Primary metric for assessing boundary alignment improvements. *Quick check*: Verify boundary detection algorithm correctly identifies segmentation edges.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input image → Encoder (feature extraction) → Superpixel-based upsampling (with regularization) → Decoder output → Semantic segmentation map

**Critical path**: The regularization term applied during superpixel-based upsampling is the critical path, as it directly influences boundary alignment quality. This occurs between the encoder feature maps and the final segmentation output.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades some flexibility in superpixel shape for improved boundary alignment. The regularization strength must be balanced against the risk of over-constraining the model. Using SLIC-superpixels as a reference provides dataset-independent structure but may not capture all semantic boundaries.

**Failure signatures**: If regularization is too strong, the model may produce overly smooth segmentations that miss fine details. If too weak, coarse annotations will continue to produce poor boundary alignment. The method may underperform on datasets where semantic boundaries don't align well with color-based superpixels.

**First experiments**: 1) Test regularization strength sweep to find optimal values, 2) Compare boundary recall on coarse vs. fine annotations with and without regularization, 3) Visualize superpixel alignment with SLIC-superpixels to verify regularization effect.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method effectiveness limited to encoder-decoder architectures with superpixel-based upsampling
- Performance depends on hyperparameter tuning for regularization strength and compactness
- May not generalize well to datasets where semantic boundaries don't align with color-based SLIC-superpixels
- Uncertainty about effectiveness on annotation coarseness levels beyond those tested

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core technical contribution and methodology are sound and well-supported by empirical results
**Medium confidence**: Claims about cross-dataset generalization and performance on varying annotation coarseness
**Medium confidence**: Relationship between regularization strength and performance gains requires further validation

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on alternative segmentation architectures (e.g., transformer-based models, FPN variants) to verify architecture independence
2. Evaluate performance degradation as annotation coarseness varies systematically to establish robustness bounds
3. Compare against additional state-of-the-art coarse annotation techniques to benchmark relative effectiveness
