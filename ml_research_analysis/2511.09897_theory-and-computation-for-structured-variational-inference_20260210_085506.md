# Theory and computation for structured variational inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09897
- Reference count: 40
- This paper establishes the first theoretical framework for star-structured variational inference (SSVI), proving existence/uniqueness of the minimizer and providing quantitative approximation guarantees.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces star-structured variational inference (SSVI), a method for approximating complex posterior distributions that exhibit a natural star graph structure where one root variable influences all leaf variables. The authors provide the first theoretical analysis of SSVI, proving existence and uniqueness of the minimizer under log-concavity assumptions, characterizing its structure through self-consistency equations, and deriving quantitative approximation guarantees. They also develop a computationally tractable projected gradient descent algorithm with provable convergence guarantees by reformulating the problem in optimal transport geometry.

## Method Summary
The method minimizes KL divergence between a star-structured variational family (one root variable affecting all leaves) and the true posterior. The optimization is formulated in optimal transport geometry using a Gaussian reference measure and transport maps. A key innovation is representing these maps using a finite-dimensional dictionary of piecewise linear "star-separable" functions, enabling projected gradient descent with provable polynomial-time convergence. The approach provides approximation guarantees that improve upon standard mean-field VI when root-leaf interactions dominate inter-leaf correlations.

## Key Results
- Proves existence, uniqueness, and self-consistency of the SSVI minimizer under log-concavity assumptions
- Derives approximation error bounds that strictly improve upon mean-field VI when root-leaf interactions dominate
- Provides explicit characterization of the SSVI minimizer for Gaussian posteriors
- Develops a projected gradient descent algorithm with ε-accuracy in polynomial time w.r.t. dimension and log(1/ε)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dynamic Programming Decomposition
The SSVI problem admits a unique solution because it decomposes into a dynamic programming recursion over root and leaf nodes. The KL divergence splits via the chain rule: the inner problem optimizes leaf distributions conditioned on the root (a mean-field problem), and the outer problem optimizes the root distribution by integrating the cost of these conditional fits. This requires strong log-concavity of the posterior.

### Mechanism 2: Root-Dominated Approximation Error
SSVI provides tighter approximation error bounds than mean-field VI when root-leaf correlations are stronger than inter-leaf correlations. The error bound scales with sum of squared inter-leaf interactions, while mean-field scales with all pairwise interactions. By capturing strong root-leaf dependencies via the star structure, SSVI eliminates these dominant terms from the error bound.

### Mechanism 3: Convex Optimization over Transport Maps
Projected gradient descent on a finite-dimensional parameter space can approximate the minimizer in polynomial time. The problem is reformulated as convex optimization over transport maps, and while the space is infinite-dimensional, a finite-dimensional dictionary of piecewise linear star-separable maps preserves convexity, allowing gradient descent to converge to the global optimum.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence & Mean-Field Approximation
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding that VI projects a true posterior π onto a tractable family C. Mean-field assumes μ(z) = ∏μᵢ(zᵢ), while this paper extends this to C_star (root + leaves), crucial for understanding why error bounds improve when dependencies exist.
  - **Quick check question**: Why does standard Mean-Field VI fail to capture the covariance between the root and leaves in a hierarchical model?

- **Concept**: Optimal Transport & Brenier's Theorem
  - **Why needed here**: The computational engine relies on representing probability measures as pushforwards of a Gaussian reference measure ρ via transport maps T. The "star-separable" structure of T(x) = (T₁(x₁), T₂(x₂|T₁(x₁)), ...) enforces the graphical structure.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the triangular structure of the Knothe-Rosenblatt map enforce conditional independence of the leaves given the root?

- **Concept**: Log-Concavity & Strong Convexity
  - **Why needed here**: This is the primary theoretical engine. Strong log-concavity implies the KL functional is convex in Wasserstein geometry, guaranteeing a unique minimizer and allowing use of functional inequalities (Poincaré, Log-Sobolev) to derive error bounds.
  - **Quick check question**: What property of the potential V(z) ensures that the optimal transport map T* is Lipschitz?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Potential V(z) → Reference ρ = N(0,I) → Solver: Projected Gradient Descent → Parameters θ* → Transport map T*

- **Critical path**:
  1. Verify SLC: Check if posterior π is strongly log-concave (required for Theorem 2.2 uniqueness)
  2. Parameterize Maps: Define dictionary of piecewise linear functions for T₁ (root) and Tᵢ(·|z₁) (leaves) based on mesh size δ and range R
  3. Gradient Loop: Iterate θ ← Proj_Θ,||·||_Θ[θ - h∇_θ KL(T_θ#ρ || π)]

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Graph Structure: Star-structure captures root-leaf covariance but assumes leaves are independent given the root. If true posterior has strong inter-leaf correlations, this model introduces bias (Theorem 2.9)
  - Dictionary Size vs. Complexity: Smaller mesh δ reduces approximation error but increases dimension |Θ| and cost of computing Gram matrix Q

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Non-Convergence: If π is not log-concave, the objective is non-convex; gradient descent may converge to a local minimum or cycle
  - High Approximation Bias: If dictionary range R is too small, tail behavior of posterior is truncated, leading to poor KL estimates

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Gaussian Posterior Recovery: Implement solver for known multivariate Gaussian π = N(m,Σ) with star-structured covariance. Compare recovered Σ* to analytical solution in Theorem 2.10 to validate gradient implementation
  2. Hierarchical GLM (Location Prior): Apply method to Bayesian GLM where βⱼ ~ N(ϑ,τ⁻²). Verify SSVI better captures posterior variance of ϑ compared to naive MFVI baseline
  3. Scalability Test: Vary dimension d and dictionary granularity δ. Plot wall-clock time vs. KL error to validate polynomial-time convergence claim (Theorem 3.8)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees hinge critically on strong log-concavity and root domination assumptions, which may not hold in many practical Bayesian models with multi-modal posteriors
- Computational scheme's polynomial-time complexity assumes specific asymptotic choices for dictionary parameters R and δ that are not fully specified for finite-sample settings
- Star structure itself may introduce significant bias when inter-leaf correlations dominate root-leaf correlations

## Confidence

- **Existence and Uniqueness**: High confidence - Decomposition argument is rigorous and supported by Proposition 2.1 and stability results from related literature
- **Approximation Error Bounds**: Medium confidence - Bounds are proven under RD assumption, but practical regimes where RD holds are not fully characterized beyond Gaussian example
- **Polynomial-Time Convergence**: Medium confidence - Projected gradient descent analysis is sound, but hidden constants in dictionary construction and conditioning of Gram matrix Q could impact practical convergence rates

## Next Checks

1. **Structural Assumption Test**: Apply SSVI to a hierarchical model where leaves have strong inter-correlations (e.g., multivariate t-distribution with low degrees of freedom). Quantify approximation error and compare to theoretical upper bound to test when star structure fails.

2. **Log-Concavity Verification**: For a non-log-concave posterior (e.g., mixture of Gaussians with well-separated modes), run projected gradient descent and monitor whether it converges to meaningful solution or exhibits predicted instability.

3. **Dictionary Sensitivity Analysis**: Fix a log-concave test case and systematically vary dictionary parameters (R, δ). Plot KL error versus computational cost to empirically verify polynomial-time complexity claim and identify practical parameter choices for target accuracy.
