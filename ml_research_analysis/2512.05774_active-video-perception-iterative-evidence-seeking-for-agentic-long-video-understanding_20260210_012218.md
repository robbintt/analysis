core_contribution: The paper proposes Active Video Perception (AVP), an iterative
  evidence-seeking framework for long video understanding. Unlike passive caption-based
  approaches, AVP treats videos as interactive environments, actively deciding what,
  when, and where to observe through a plan-observe-reflect loop.

# Active Video Perception: Iterative Evidence Seeking for Agentic Long Video Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05774
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AVP achieves 5.7% average accuracy improvement over DVD while using 18.4% of inference time and 12.4% of input tokens across five long video understanding benchmarks

## Executive Summary
Active Video Perception (AVP) introduces an iterative evidence-seeking framework for long video understanding that treats videos as interactive environments rather than passive sequences. The system employs a three-stage plan-observe-reflect loop where a planner proposes targeted observation strategies, an observer extracts time-stamped evidence from pixels, and a reflector evaluates evidence sufficiency against the query. This active approach outperforms passive caption-based methods and previous agentic systems by 5.7% average accuracy across five benchmarks while achieving significant efficiency gains.

## Method Summary
AVP addresses long video understanding through an iterative evidence-seeking framework that breaks from traditional passive approaches. The system operates through a plan-observe-reflect loop where the planner generates observation strategies based on the query, the observer extracts targeted video segments as evidence, and the reflector determines if collected evidence is sufficient to answer the query. This architecture allows AVP to actively seek relevant information rather than passively processing entire videos, making it particularly effective for long-form content where exhaustive processing would be computationally prohibitive.

## Key Results
- AVP achieves 5.7% average accuracy improvement over the leading agentic method (DVD) across five benchmarks
- Uses only 18.4% of the inference time compared to DVD
- Requires only 12.4% of the input tokens compared to DVD
- Demonstrates superior performance on MINERVA, LVBench, MLVU, Video-MME, and LongVideoBench benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AVP works by treating video understanding as an interactive evidence-gathering task rather than a passive information extraction problem. The planner module strategically determines what evidence to seek based on the query, avoiding the computational waste of processing irrelevant content. The observer module directly extracts time-stamped visual evidence from video pixels, maintaining temporal context that captions alone cannot provide. The reflector module evaluates evidence sufficiency iteratively, allowing the system to request additional evidence only when needed. This targeted approach combines the efficiency of selective processing with the richness of direct visual evidence.

## Foundational Learning

### Video Understanding Challenges
- **Why needed**: Long videos contain vast amounts of information where most content is irrelevant to specific queries
- **Quick check**: Can the system identify relevant segments without processing the entire video?

### Active Learning Framework
- **Why needed**: Passive processing of long videos is computationally prohibitive and inefficient
- **Quick check**: Does the system improve accuracy while reducing computational cost?

### Temporal Evidence Extraction
- **Why needed**: Captions lose critical temporal and visual details needed for accurate understanding
- **Quick check**: Can the system maintain temporal context while extracting relevant evidence?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Planner -> Observer -> Reflector -> (feedback to Planner)

### Critical Path
Query -> Planner (strategy generation) -> Observer (evidence extraction) -> Reflector (sufficiency check) -> Answer or repeat loop

### Design Tradeoffs
- Selective evidence extraction vs. comprehensive processing
- Iterative refinement vs. one-pass processing
- Direct pixel observation vs. caption-based approaches

### Failure Signatures
- Insufficient evidence collection leading to incorrect answers
- Over-collection of irrelevant evidence wasting computational resources
- Failure to recognize when sufficient evidence has been gathered

### First Experiments to Run
1. Test AVP on a simple video with clear, localized evidence to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate performance on videos where captions alone are insufficient
3. Measure evidence collection efficiency across different query types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on accuracy metrics without extensive ablation studies on the three-component architecture
- Benchmarks may not fully capture real-world long video scenarios with natural ambiguity
- Claims of "interactive environments" are somewhat overstated given the constrained plan-observe-reflect loop
- Efficiency claims lack absolute runtime measurements and scalability analysis

## Confidence

### Major Uncertainties and Limitations:
The paper demonstrates strong empirical performance but has several important limitations. The evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy metrics without extensive ablation studies on the three-component architecture (planner, observer, reflector), making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of each module. The benchmarks used, while diverse, may not fully capture real-world long video scenarios with natural ambiguity and incomplete information. The claim that AVP "treats videos as interactive environments" is somewhat overstated - the interaction remains within a constrained plan-observe-reflect loop rather than demonstrating true environmental engagement. Additionally, the computational efficiency claims (18.4% inference time, 12.4% tokens) are relative to DVD and lack absolute runtime measurements, making it unclear how AVP scales to longer videos or real-time applications.

### Confidence Labels:
- **High confidence**: AVP's superior performance over DVD across all five benchmarks (5.7% average accuracy improvement)
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that AVP "activates pertinent evidence and avoids irrelevant content" - supported by accuracy metrics but lacking qualitative analysis of evidence selection
- **Medium confidence**: The efficiency claims (18.4% inference time, 12.4% tokens) - supported by relative comparisons but lacking absolute measurements and scalability analysis

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on architectural components**: Remove each of the three modules (planner, observer, reflector) individually to quantify their specific contributions to the 5.7% accuracy improvement, providing clearer insight into which component drives performance gains.

2. **Qualitative analysis of evidence selection**: Conduct human evaluation of the evidence clips selected by AVP across diverse query types to verify that the system is indeed "avoiding irrelevant content" rather than simply processing more efficiently, including case studies where AVP succeeds or fails.

3. **Scalability and real-time performance testing**: Measure absolute inference times and memory usage for videos of varying lengths (e.g., 5, 10, 30 minutes) to validate the claimed efficiency benefits in practical scenarios and assess whether the 12.4% token reduction holds at scale.
