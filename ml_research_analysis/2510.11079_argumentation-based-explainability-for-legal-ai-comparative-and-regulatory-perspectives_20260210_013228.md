# Argumentation-Based Explainability for Legal AI: Comparative and Regulatory Perspectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.11079
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11079
- Authors: Andrada Iulia Prajescu; Roberto Confalonieri
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Computational argumentation frameworks provide the most robust foundation for explainable AI in legal contexts, aligning well with legal reasoning's defeasible, contestable, and value-sensitive nature while meeting GDPR and AIA regulatory requirements.

## Executive Summary
This paper examines explainability approaches for legal AI systems, comparing example-based, rule-based, hybrid, and argumentation-based explanation methods. The authors argue that computational argumentation frameworks offer superior alignment with legal reasoning because they capture the inherently defeasible and contestable nature of law. The work demonstrates how argumentation-based explanations satisfy the transparency and contestability requirements of EU regulations including GDPR and AIA, positioning them as more suitable than alternative XAI techniques for legal applications.

## Method Summary
The paper provides a theoretical comparative analysis of different explanation approaches for legal AI systems, evaluating their suitability based on how well they align with legal reasoning principles and regulatory requirements. The authors examine four categories of explanation methods—example-based, rule-based, hybrid, and argumentation-based—through the lens of legal reasoning characteristics such as defeasibility, contestability, and value sensitivity. They analyze regulatory compliance requirements from GDPR and AIA, assessing how each explanation method addresses transparency and contestability mandates. The analysis synthesizes legal theory, XAI research, and regulatory frameworks to construct a theoretical framework positioning argumentation-based explanations as optimal for legal AI.

## Key Results
- Argumentation-based explanations align well with legal reasoning's defeasible, contestable, and value-sensitive nature
- Computational argumentation frameworks satisfy GDPR and AIA transparency and contestability requirements
- Argumentation-based methods are positioned as superior to example-based, rule-based, and hybrid approaches for legal AI applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Argumentation-based explanations work by representing legal reasoning as structured arguments that can be attacked, defended, and weighed against competing arguments, mirroring how legal professionals actually reason through cases. This approach captures the defeasible nature of legal reasoning where conclusions can be overturned by new evidence or counterarguments, unlike rule-based systems that treat legal reasoning as deterministic. The framework naturally incorporates value judgments and policy considerations that are central to legal decision-making but difficult to express in pure rule-based systems. By making the reasoning process contestable and transparent, argumentation-based explanations satisfy regulatory requirements for explainability while providing legal professionals with explanations that match their own reasoning processes.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Defeasible reasoning** - Why needed: Legal reasoning often involves conclusions that can be overturned by new evidence or counterarguments; quick check: Can the system handle "yes, but..." type legal reasoning?

2. **Argumentation frameworks** - Why needed: Provides formal structure for representing competing arguments and their relationships; quick check: Can arguments attack and defend each other in a structured way?

3. **Contestability in legal AI** - Why needed: Legal decisions must be open to challenge and review; quick check: Can users meaningfully question and debate the system's reasoning?

4. **Regulatory transparency requirements** - Why needed: GDPR and AIA mandate specific levels of explainability; quick check: Does the explanation satisfy documented regulatory criteria?

5. **Legal reasoning characteristics** - Why needed: Understanding how lawyers actually think is crucial for effective legal AI; quick check: Does the explanation match how legal professionals would explain the same decision?

6. **Value-sensitive reasoning** - Why needed: Legal decisions often involve balancing competing values and interests; quick check: Can the system represent and weigh different policy considerations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Query -> Legal Reasoning Engine -> Argumentation Graph -> Explanation Generator -> User Interface

**Critical path**: Legal Reasoning Engine -> Argumentation Graph (this is where the core legal reasoning and argumentation structure is built)

**Design tradeoffs**: Argumentation frameworks provide richer, more contestable explanations but require more computational resources and expertise to implement compared to rule-based systems. Rule-based approaches are simpler and more efficient but fail to capture the nuanced, defeasible nature of legal reasoning.

**Failure signatures**: Poor argumentation structure leading to circular reasoning or unexplained assumptions; inability to handle conflicting legal precedents; explanations that don't connect to actual legal reasoning practices; computational complexity making real-time explanations impractical.

**First experiments**:
1. Implement a simple argumentation-based explanation for a basic contract dispute scenario
2. Compare user comprehension of argumentation-based versus rule-based explanations in a controlled study
3. Test scalability by applying the argumentation framework to increasingly complex legal scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework lacks empirical validation with actual legal professionals
- No concrete case studies demonstrating argumentation-based explanations in practice
- Regulatory analysis depends on specific interpretations of GDPR and AIA requirements
- Practical implementation challenges and computational overhead are not fully explored

## Confidence
- Alignment with legal reasoning: High
- Regulatory compliance claims: Medium
- Practical implementation feasibility: Low
- Empirical validation through user studies: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with legal professionals comparing comprehension, trust, and usability of argumentation-based versus rule-based explanations in simulated legal AI scenarios
2. Develop and test a prototype legal AI system implementing argumentation-based explanations to measure computational overhead and scalability
3. Seek feedback from regulatory bodies or conduct legal analysis of how argumentation-based explanations would fare under regulatory scrutiny in actual compliance audits
