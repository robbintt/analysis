core_contribution: The paper addresses bias in LLM-as-a-judge evaluations caused by
  imperfect sensitivity and specificity, which leads to overestimation or underestimation
  of true accuracy. It proposes a plug-in framework that corrects this bias and provides

# How to Correctly Report LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.21140
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21140
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposes bias-corrected LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with confidence intervals that remain unbiased under distribution shift

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental problem in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems: the bias introduced by imperfect sensitivity and specificity of language models used as judges. When LLMs evaluate other LLMs or AI systems, their imperfect ability to correctly identify true positives and true negatives leads to systematic overestimation or underestimation of true accuracy. The authors propose a statistical framework that corrects this bias using calibration data and provides reliable confidence intervals that account for uncertainty in both test and calibration datasets. Their method remains theoretically unbiased even when test and calibration datasets have different distributions, a critical advantage over existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework uses a plug-in approach that corrects bias in LLM-based accuracy estimates by estimating the judge's sensitivity and specificity from calibration data. The core technique employs the Rogan & Gladen (1978) estimator, which adjusts raw accuracy scores based on sensitivity and specificity estimates to provide an unbiased estimate of true accuracy. To minimize interval length and improve efficiency, the framework includes an adaptive calibration allocation strategy that dynamically determines the optimal split between test and calibration data. The method provides confidence intervals that account for uncertainty in both datasets, offering a complete statistical characterization of the evaluation results. Unlike existing methods, the framework maintains unbiasedness even under distribution shift between test and calibration data.

## Key Results
- Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate significantly reduced bias compared to uncorrected methods across multiple parameter settings
- Confidence intervals maintain proper coverage probability, accounting for uncertainty from both test and calibration datasets
- Experimental validation on Chatbot Arena benchmark shows practical utility and reliable uncertainty quantification
- Theoretical analysis proves the method remains unbiased under distribution shift between test and calibration datasets
- Framework enables statistically sound LLM-based evaluation with provable guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling the imperfect nature of LLM judges as binary classifiers. By estimating sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) from calibration data, the method can mathematically correct for the systematic errors that LLMs introduce when evaluating outputs. The Rogan & Gladen estimator provides the theoretical foundation for this correction, transforming observed accuracy into an unbiased estimate of true accuracy. The adaptive allocation strategy optimizes the trade-off between bias reduction and interval width by determining the optimal amount of calibration data needed for reliable estimation.

## Foundational Learning

**Binary Classification Metrics** (why needed: to understand judge performance characteristics; quick check: can you calculate sensitivity and specificity from confusion matrix)
**Confidence Interval Construction** (why needed: to quantify uncertainty in accuracy estimates; quick check: can you explain coverage probability?)
**Rogan & Gladen Estimator** (why needed: provides bias correction formula; quick check: can you derive the unbiased accuracy estimate?)
**Distribution Shift** (why needed: to understand when methods fail; quick check: can you distinguish covariate shift from label shift?)
**Plug-in Estimators** (why needed: to understand the statistical framework; quick check: can you explain plug-in vs. direct estimation?)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Calibration Data -> Sensitivity/Specificity Estimation -> Rogan & Gladen Correction -> Unbiased Accuracy Estimate -> Confidence Interval Construction -> Final Report

**Critical Path:** The sequence from calibration data collection through Rogan & Gladen correction to final accuracy estimate represents the essential processing pipeline that cannot be bypassed without losing the bias correction property.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Fixed vs. adaptive calibration allocation (adaptive minimizes interval length but requires more complex implementation); Rogan & Gladen vs. alternative bias correction methods (Rogan & Gladen provides theoretical guarantees but can be unstable near boundaries).

**Failure Signatures:** Interval estimates exceeding [0,1] range indicate calibration data quality issues; NaN values suggest sensitivity/specificity estimates are at boundary values; wide confidence intervals relative to point estimate suggest insufficient calibration data.

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Monte Carlo simulation with known ground truth to verify bias correction accuracy; 2) Sensitivity analysis varying calibration data quality to establish robustness thresholds; 3) Cross-dataset validation to test distribution shift performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends critically on sufficient high-quality calibration data for reliable sensitivity/specificity estimation
- Rogan & Gladen estimator can be unstable when true accuracy approaches 0 or 1, potentially producing invalid interval estimates
- Adaptive allocation strategy assumes justification for additional calibration data cost, which may not hold in resource-constrained scenarios
- Performance under extreme distribution shift, while theoretically unbiased, may degrade practically due to increased variance in calibration estimates

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Theoretical framework using Rogan & Gladen estimator is well-established; mathematical proof of unbiasedness under distribution shift is rigorous; Monte Carlo simulations show consistent bias reduction across parameter settings.

**Medium Confidence:** Chatbot Arena benchmark validation demonstrates practical utility; comparison with human-only evaluation variance depends on assumptions about human inter-rater reliability that may not generalize across all task types.

**Low Confidence:** Claims of enabling "statistically sound" evaluation in general settings require broader validation across diverse domains; adaptive allocation strategy performance relative to fixed allocation needs more empirical comparison.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation:** Test framework on diverse LLM evaluation tasks (code generation, summarization, question answering) to verify robustness across different output types and evaluation criteria.

2. **Calibration data efficiency:** Systematically vary calibration-to-test data ratios to quantify bias-variance tradeoff and establish practical allocation guidelines for different resource scenarios.

3. **Distribution shift sensitivity:** Conduct controlled experiments with varying degrees of distribution shift between test and calibration datasets to characterize performance degradation and identify practical utility thresholds.
