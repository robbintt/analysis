# eSapiens: A Platform for Secure and Auditable Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.09588
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09588
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: Enterprise-grade AI platform integrating hybrid vector retrieval, structured document ingestion, and no-code orchestration for secure, auditable RAG workflows

## Executive Summary
eSapiens is an enterprise AI platform designed to securely integrate large language models with proprietary business data and workflows. The system supports major LLMs including OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek, and features specialized engines for citation-aware retrieval-augmented generation (DEREK) and SQL-style database queries (THOR). Two key experiments validate its performance: legal corpus retrieval benchmarks show 512-token chunks achieve 91.3% top-3 accuracy, while generation quality tests demonstrate up to 23% improvement in factual alignment and context consistency compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The platform employs hybrid vector retrieval combined with structured document ingestion through a no-code orchestration layer built on LangChain. It integrates multiple LLM providers and implements specialized retrieval and generation engines for different enterprise use cases. Performance validation was conducted through two experiments: retrieval accuracy testing on legal corpora across different chunk sizes, and generation quality assessment using TRACe metrics across five different LLMs compared to baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- Legal corpus retrieval achieves 91.3% top-3 accuracy with 512-token chunk size
- Generation quality shows up to 23% improvement in factual alignment and context consistency
- Platform supports major LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and enterprise database queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform's effectiveness stems from its hybrid retrieval approach that combines vector search with structured document processing, enabling accurate context retrieval across diverse enterprise data formats. The no-code orchestration layer democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities while maintaining security and auditability requirements. By supporting multiple LLM providers and implementing specialized engines for different query types (textual vs. SQL-style), the system can optimize performance for specific enterprise workflows while maintaining consistency and traceability across all operations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hybrid Vector Retrieval**: Combines semantic and keyword-based search to improve accuracy across different document types. Why needed: Pure semantic search often misses critical context in structured documents. Quick check: Test retrieval precision on both unstructured text and structured data formats.
- **Chunk Size Optimization**: Determines optimal tokenization strategy for retrieval performance. Why needed: Different chunk sizes affect both retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency. Quick check: Benchmark retrieval accuracy across multiple chunk sizes (128, 512, 1024 tokens).
- **TRACe Metrics**: Framework for evaluating factual alignment and context consistency in generated outputs. Why needed: Standard LLM evaluation metrics often miss domain-specific accuracy requirements. Quick check: Compare TRACe scores against traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE.
- **No-Code Orchestration**: Visual workflow builder that enables non-technical users to create complex AI pipelines. Why needed: Reduces barrier to entry for enterprise AI adoption while maintaining governance controls. Quick check: Measure development time reduction compared to traditional coding approaches.
- **Citation-Aware Generation**: Ensures generated content can be traced back to source documents. Why needed: Critical for auditability in regulated industries like legal and finance. Quick check: Verify citation accuracy across different document types and query complexities.
- **Multi-Provider LLM Integration**: Supports multiple LLM providers within unified framework. Why needed: Enables optimization for cost, performance, and compliance requirements. Quick check: Compare response quality and latency across different LLM providers for identical queries.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Interface -> No-Code Orchestrator -> DEREK Engine -> Vector Database -> Document Store -> LLM Gateway -> Response Generator

**Critical Path**: Query submission → Document retrieval (DEREK) → Context assembly → LLM generation → Response formatting → Audit logging

**Design Tradeoffs**: The platform prioritizes security and auditability over maximum performance speed, implementing comprehensive logging and citation tracking that may introduce latency but ensures compliance. The no-code approach sacrifices some customization flexibility for broader accessibility, while multi-provider support adds complexity but enables optimization for different use cases.

**Failure Signatures**: Retrieval failures typically manifest as incomplete or irrelevant context being passed to LLMs, resulting in hallucinated responses. Generation quality issues often stem from insufficient context rather than model limitations, particularly in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. Performance bottlenecks commonly occur at the document ingestion stage when processing large volumes of structured data.

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Retrieval accuracy testing across different chunk sizes on legal corpus; 2) Generation quality comparison using TRACe metrics across five LLMs; 3) Audit trail completeness verification across different document types and query patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content

## Limitations
- Retrieval performance validation limited to legal corpora, raising questions about generalizability to other domains
- Statistical significance of 23% improvement not established with confidence intervals
- No discussion of computational overhead, latency, or scalability in production environments
- Security and auditability claims not demonstrated through testing or adversarial evaluation

## Confidence
- Confidence in retrieval accuracy claims: **Medium** (domain-specific validation, no statistical detail)
- Confidence in generation quality improvements: **Medium** (lacks baseline specification and significance testing)
- Confidence in enterprise integration capabilities: **Medium** (architecture described but no usage data)
- Confidence in security and auditability: **Low** (stated but not demonstrated)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct retrieval-augmented generation experiments on non-legal, high-stakes datasets (medical records, financial reports) to assess cross-domain robustness
2. Perform statistical significance testing and report confidence intervals for the 23% improvement across multiple LLMs and benchmarks
3. Benchmark platform computational overhead and latency in production-scale deployment with concurrent queries and large-scale document ingestion
