# An Evolutionary Framework for Automatic Optimization Benchmark Generation via Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.12723
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12723
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLM-EBG successfully generates benchmarks that induce significant performance differences between GA and DE, with GA-favoring benchmarks being highly sensitive to variable scaling while DE-favoring benchmarks exhibit more moderate curvature.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-EBG, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as generative operators within an evolutionary algorithm to automatically create optimization benchmarks. The framework represents optimization problems as symbolic expressions and evolves them based on fitness functions that measure performance differences between optimization algorithms. By treating the LLM as a black-box generator that can create diverse problem structures, LLM-EBG addresses the challenge of manually designing benchmarks that can effectively differentiate between algorithm capabilities. The approach successfully generates benchmarks that consistently favor either genetic algorithms or differential evolution, demonstrating the framework's ability to capture the distinct search behaviors of different optimization methods.

## Method Summary
LLM-EBG combines evolutionary algorithms with LLM-based generation to create optimization benchmarks. The framework operates by encoding optimization problems as symbolic expressions, which are then evolved through mutation and crossover operations. The LLM serves as a generative operator, creating new problem instances based on prompts derived from existing benchmarks. Fitness evaluation measures how well a benchmark distinguishes between algorithm performance, using metrics such as the ratio of successful solutions or the difference in objective function values. The evolutionary process iteratively refines the benchmark population, selecting for problems that maximize performance gaps between target algorithms. This approach automates the traditionally labor-intensive process of benchmark design while ensuring the generated problems are structurally diverse and algorithmically discriminative.

## Key Results
- LLM-EBG generated benchmarks favoring GA in 8 out of 10 trials and favoring DE in 9 out of 10 trials
- GA-favoring benchmarks showed high sensitivity to variable scaling, while DE-favoring benchmarks exhibited moderate curvature
- The framework successfully created structurally diverse benchmarks that reflect distinct search behaviors of different optimization algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the LLM's ability to generate diverse symbolic expressions while using evolutionary pressure to guide the generation toward benchmarks that maximize algorithmic performance differences. The fitness function acts as a selection mechanism that rewards benchmarks capable of inducing significant performance gaps between algorithms. By encoding problems as symbolic expressions, the framework maintains mathematical interpretability while allowing the LLM to explore the space of possible benchmark structures. The evolutionary operators (mutation, crossover) provide systematic variation, while the LLM introduces creative diversity that might not emerge from purely deterministic operations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Symbolic Expression Encoding**: Mathematical problems represented as parse trees or strings; needed for LLM compatibility and evolutionary manipulation; quick check: verify expressions parse correctly and evaluate to valid objective functions.
- **Evolutionary Algorithm Mechanics**: Population-based search with selection, mutation, and crossover; needed to iteratively improve benchmark quality; quick check: confirm population diversity is maintained across generations.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts to guide LLM output toward desired problem structures; needed to ensure relevant and diverse benchmark generation; quick check: test prompt variations on sample expressions to assess output quality.
- **Fitness Landscape Analysis**: Measuring algorithmic performance differences across benchmark instances; needed to quantify benchmark effectiveness; quick check: verify fitness calculations match expected performance gaps between algorithms.
- **Variable Scaling Sensitivity**: How optimization performance changes with parameter magnitude transformations; needed to understand GA-favoring benchmark characteristics; quick check: test algorithm performance across different variable scaling ranges.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Evolutionary Algorithm -> LLM Generator -> Fitness Evaluator -> Selection Operator

**Critical Path**: Problem encoding → LLM generation → Fitness evaluation → Selection → New population creation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Using LLM as black-box generator trades interpretability for diversity and creativity; evolutionary pressure ensures algorithmic relevance but may converge prematurely; symbolic expression representation balances mathematical rigor with computational tractability.

**Failure Signatures**: Premature convergence to similar benchmark structures, LLM generating invalid or non-discriminative problems, fitness evaluations failing to capture meaningful performance differences, or the evolutionary process getting stuck in local optima.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test LLM-EBG with a single algorithm pair (GA vs DE) on low-dimensional problems to verify basic functionality.
2. Evaluate the impact of different LLM prompting strategies on benchmark diversity and quality.
3. Compare evolutionary convergence rates with and without LLM generation to assess the contribution of LLM-based diversity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to only two specific algorithms (GA and DE), restricting generalizability
- Potential bias inheritance from LLM training data and evolutionary operator choices
- Uncertainty about performance with higher-dimensional problems beyond tested scope
- Landscape analysis based on relatively small sample sizes (10 trials per algorithm type)

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Framework successfully generates benchmarks with measurable performance differences between GA and DE
- Qualitative landscape analysis findings are internally consistent

**Medium Confidence**:
- General applicability to other algorithm pairs
- Reproducibility of specific benchmark characteristics

**Low Confidence**:
- Scalability to higher-dimensional problems
- Robustness across diverse optimization domains

## Next Checks
1. Test LLM-EBG with a broader range of optimization algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct larger-scale experiments with 20+ trials per algorithm type to strengthen statistical significance of landscape analysis findings.
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on benchmark problems with dimensions higher than those tested to assess scalability limitations.
