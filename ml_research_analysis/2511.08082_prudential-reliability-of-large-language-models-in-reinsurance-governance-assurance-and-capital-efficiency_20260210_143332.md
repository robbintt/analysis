# Prudential Reliability of Large Language Models in Reinsurance: Governance, Assurance, and Capital Efficiency

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08082
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08082
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A five-pillar prudential framework for LLM reliability in reinsurance, implemented via RAIRAB benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a prudential framework for evaluating the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance applications. The framework consists of five pillars: governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment, translating supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and international guidance into measurable lifecycle controls. Through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), the study demonstrates that retrieval-grounded LLM configurations achieve 0.90 grounding accuracy, reduce hallucination and interpretive drift by approximately 40%, and nearly double transparency compared to baseline configurations. The research shows that governance-embedded LLMs can meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability, functioning as information-processing intermediaries that lower search, reconciliation, and oversight costs, thereby reducing informational frictions that influence solvency and capital efficiency.

## Method Summary
The study develops and implements the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB) to evaluate LLM performance across six task families in reinsurance. The framework translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls organized around five pillars: governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment. Retrieval-grounded LLM configurations were tested against baseline models to assess grounding accuracy, hallucination rates, interpretive drift, and transparency metrics. The evaluation methodology combines quantitative performance metrics with qualitative assessment of governance mechanisms and their impact on informational frictions affecting capital efficiency.

## Key Results
- Retrieval-grounded LLM configurations achieved grounding accuracy of 0.90
- Hallucination and interpretive drift reduced by approximately 40% compared to baseline
- Transparency nearly doubled with governance-embedded LLM configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by translating existing prudential doctrines into LLM-specific controls that address the unique challenges of AI in financial services. The five-pillar architecture creates systematic guardrails around data quality, decision transparency, and accountability. Retrieval-grounded configurations reduce reliance on parametric memory by incorporating verifiable external sources, thereby minimizing hallucination risks. Governance mechanisms function as information-processing intermediaries that lower search, reconciliation, and oversight costs, reducing informational frictions that directly impact solvency and capital efficiency. The alignment with established supervisory expectations (Solvency II, SR 11-7) provides a familiar regulatory framework while adapting to AI-specific requirements for transparency and accountability.

## Foundational Learning

**Prudential AI Governance**
- Why needed: Ensures AI systems meet financial stability and consumer protection standards
- Quick check: Framework aligns with Solvency II, SR 11-7, and international supervisory guidance

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Why needed: Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in verifiable external sources
- Quick check: Achieved 0.90 grounding accuracy versus baseline performance

**Informational Friction Analysis**
- Why needed: Quantifies how governance mechanisms affect capital efficiency and solvency
- Quick check: Reduced search, reconciliation, and oversight costs through intermediary functions

**Regulatory Alignment Mapping**
- Why needed: Translates AI-specific challenges into existing supervisory language
- Quick check: Five-pillar framework maps directly to established prudential doctrines

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Governance Layer -> Data Lineage Module -> Assurance Engine -> Resilience Framework -> Regulatory Alignment Interface

**Critical Path**
1. Data validation and lineage tracking
2. Retrieval-grounded response generation
3. Transparency logging and audit trail
4. Regulatory compliance verification
5. Performance monitoring and drift detection

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Precision vs. recall in grounding accuracy
- Computational overhead of retrieval vs. parametric memory
- Granularity of audit trails vs. operational efficiency
- Static vs. dynamic regulatory alignment mechanisms

**Failure Signatures**
- Increased hallucination rates indicate breakdown in retrieval grounding
- Interpretive drift suggests model degradation or data drift
- Transparency gaps reveal governance mechanism failures
- Regulatory misalignment indicates inadequate framework adaptation

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Baseline vs. retrieval-grounded accuracy comparison across all six task families
2. Transparency metric evaluation with varying governance layer configurations
3. Long-term performance stability assessment under changing data conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to six task families, potentially missing edge cases and diverse applications
- Framework assumes adequacy of existing prudential doctrines for evolving AI challenges
- Does not address potential biases in training data or long-term performance stability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Framework alignment with established prudential standards and effectiveness in reducing informational frictions

**Medium Confidence**: Observed improvements in grounding accuracy (0.90) and transparency metrics

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability to all reinsurance applications and long-term effectiveness in dynamic regulatory environments

## Next Checks
1. Test RAIRAB benchmark across broader range of reinsurance tasks, including edge cases and high-stakes scenarios
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess LLM performance stability and framework effectiveness over time
3. Investigate potential biases in training data and model outputs, evaluating framework's mitigation capabilities
