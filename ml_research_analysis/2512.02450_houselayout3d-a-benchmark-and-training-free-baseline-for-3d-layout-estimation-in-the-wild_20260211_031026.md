# HouseLayout3D: A Benchmark and Training-Free Baseline for 3D Layout Estimation in the Wild

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02450
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02450
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces first real-world benchmark for 3D layout estimation in large-scale multi-floor buildings

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HOUSELAYOUT3D, the first real-world benchmark for 3D layout estimation in large-scale multi-floor buildings. The dataset contains complex buildings with up to five floors and forty rooms per floor, including detailed annotations for walls, floors, ceilings, stairs, doors, and windows. The authors propose MultiFloor3D, a training-free baseline that combines modern scene reconstruction with layout fitting to handle multi-floor layouts without splitting scenes into individual floors. MultiFloor3D outperforms existing deep learning approaches on both HOUSELAYOUT3D and prior datasets, achieving F1 scores of 0.38 for structural elements and 0.41 for stairs on HOUSELAYOUT3D.

## Method Summary
MultiFloor3D is a training-free baseline that processes entire multi-floor buildings holistically using reconstructed point clouds as input. The method combines modern scene reconstruction techniques with layout fitting algorithms to estimate 3D building layouts without requiring per-floor scene splitting. By maintaining global context across all floors, the approach can reason about inter-floor structures like staircases while preserving spatial relationships throughout the building. The system leverages existing reconstruction pipelines and applies geometric constraints to extract architectural elements from the resulting point cloud.

## Key Results
- MultiFloor3D achieves F1 scores of 0.38 for structural elements (walls, floors, ceilings) on HOUSELAYOUT3D
- The method scores 0.41 F1 for stairs detection on HOUSELAYOUT3D
- MultiFloor3D outperforms existing deep learning approaches on both HOUSELAYOUT3D and prior datasets
- Successfully demonstrates navigation application using generated layouts and large language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The training-free approach succeeds by leveraging the completeness of modern scene reconstruction methods while avoiding the architectural context loss that occurs when splitting multi-floor scenes. By processing entire buildings as unified 3D spaces, MultiFloor3D maintains spatial relationships crucial for understanding vertical connectivity through stairs and elevators. The method exploits geometric priors inherent in building architecture - planar surfaces, orthogonal relationships, and hierarchical room structures - to extract layouts without requiring extensive training data. This design choice enables zero-shot generalization to new building types while avoiding domain shift issues that plague supervised approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **3D Scene Reconstruction**: Converting sensor data into complete 3D point clouds - needed to create the geometric foundation for layout extraction; quick check: verify point cloud completeness and noise levels
- **Geometric Layout Fitting**: Algorithms that extract architectural primitives from 3D data - needed to identify walls, floors, ceilings from raw geometry; quick check: test fitting accuracy on synthetic primitives
- **Multi-floor Spatial Reasoning**: Maintaining global context across vertical dimensions - needed for understanding inter-floor connectivity; quick check: validate staircase detection in mixed-floor scenarios
- **Architectural Element Classification**: Distinguishing between structural components (walls vs. doors vs. windows) - needed for semantic understanding of layouts; quick check: test classification on isolated geometric primitives
- **Point Cloud Processing**: Efficient manipulation of large-scale 3D data - needed to handle buildings with thousands of points; quick check: measure processing time vs. point cloud size
- **Zero-shot Learning**: Making predictions without task-specific training - needed for the training-free approach; quick check: test on held-out building types

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Point Cloud Reconstruction -> Geometric Preprocessing -> Floor Segmentation -> Room Layout Extraction -> Structural Element Classification -> Output Layout

Critical Path: The reconstruction quality directly impacts all downstream components. Poor reconstruction leads to geometric errors that propagate through floor segmentation and room extraction, ultimately degrading the final layout accuracy. The method's reliance on holistic building processing means errors in early stages affect the entire building's layout estimation.

Design Tradeoffs: The training-free design sacrifices potential accuracy gains from learned features in exchange for zero-shot generalization and reduced data requirements. Processing entire buildings maintains architectural context but increases computational complexity compared to per-floor approaches. The method trades fine-grained detail for global consistency across floors.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include incorrect floor segmentation when vertical structures are poorly reconstructed, missed staircases when inter-floor connections are obscured in the point cloud, and wall detection failures in areas with heavy occlusion or reflective surfaces. The system may struggle with non-orthogonal architecture or buildings with significant geometric irregularities.

First Experiments:
1. Test MultiFloor3D on synthetic buildings with known ground truth to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate the method on buildings with varying reconstruction qualities to assess robustness
3. Compare holistic vs. per-floor processing approaches on the same dataset to quantify the benefit of global context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method relies on reconstructed point clouds, inheriting potential noise and artifacts from the reconstruction process
- Systematic evaluation of how reconstruction quality affects layout estimation accuracy remains limited
- The training-free approach may struggle with highly irregular architectural designs or non-standard building geometries

## Confidence

High confidence:
- MultiFloor3D outperforms existing deep learning approaches on HOUSELAYOUT3D benchmark
- The method's ability to process entire multi-floor buildings holistically without splitting scenes is validated

Medium confidence:
- Claims about generalizability to real-world scenarios are supported by the dataset's diversity but require broader testing across different building types and capture conditions
- The navigation application demonstration shows promise but represents a preliminary proof-of-concept rather than comprehensive validation of practical utility

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MultiFloor3D performance on point clouds generated from different reconstruction methods to assess robustness to reconstruction quality variations
2. Test the method on buildings with unconventional architectural designs (e.g., circular layouts, split-level designs) to identify failure modes
3. Conduct user studies with architects and building professionals to validate the practical utility of generated layouts for real-world applications beyond the demonstrated navigation example
