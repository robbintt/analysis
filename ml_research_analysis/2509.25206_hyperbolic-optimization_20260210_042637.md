- Hyperbolic AdamW optimizer achieves faster convergence in diffusion models on butterfly dataset

## Executive Summary
This work extends Riemannian optimization to hyperbolic manifolds by developing a Hyperbolic AdamW optimizer for training diffusion models. The key idea is to adapt the AdamW update rules to the Poincaré ball geometry, transforming gradients according to the hyperbolic metric and projecting parameters to remain within the manifold. Experiments on a butterfly image generation dataset show that the hyperbolic optimizers achieve faster convergence in terms of FID score compared to standard Euclidean optimizers, particularly in the early training stages.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces hyperbolic variants of AdamW and SGD optimizers by adapting the standard update rules to the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. The gradients are transformed using the hyperbolic metric tensor before applying the optimizer update, and parameters are projected back onto the manifold to ensure they remain within the valid region. Additionally, a hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics is proposed for the diffusion process, replacing the standard Euclidean time steps with hyperbolic time sampling.

## Key Results
- Hyperbolic optimizers achieve faster convergence in FID scores compared to Euclidean counterparts, especially in early training stages
- Improvements observed for both hyperbolic SGD and hyperbolic AdamW variants
- Visual inspection confirms improved sample quality at lower epochs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper proposes adapting standard optimization algorithms to hyperbolic geometry by transforming gradients and parameters according to the Poincaré ball metric. This geometric adaptation allows the optimization process to better capture the hierarchical and tree-like structures often present in data, potentially leading to faster convergence and improved sample quality in generative models.

## Foundational Learning
- Poincaré ball model: Why needed - Provides a concrete representation of hyperbolic space for implementing geometric adaptations. Quick check - Verify that the metric tensor and exponential/logarithmic maps are correctly implemented.
- Riemannian gradient: Why needed - Captures the direction of steepest descent in curved spaces. Quick check - Ensure gradients are properly transformed using the metric tensor.
- Exponential and logarithmic maps: Why needed - Enable moving between tangent spaces and the manifold itself. Quick check - Test that parameter updates correctly project back onto the manifold.

## Architecture Onboarding
The hyperbolic optimization pipeline consists of: Data -> Hyperbolic time sampling -> Langevin dynamics -> Hyperbolic gradient computation -> Parameter update (AdamW/SGD) -> Manifold projection -> Updated parameters. The critical path is the gradient transformation and parameter update steps, which must correctly handle the hyperbolic geometry. A key design tradeoff is between computational complexity (due to the geometric transformations) and potential gains in convergence speed and sample quality. Failure signatures include exploding gradients or parameters moving outside the valid manifold region. Three first experiments: 1) Verify manifold projection works correctly, 2) Test gradient transformations on simple functions, 3) Compare convergence on a simple toy dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope: experiments conducted on only one synthetic dataset and one model architecture
- Modest improvements in FID scores raise questions about practical significance
- Lack of theoretical convergence guarantees or rigorous analysis of the hyperbolic optimization algorithms

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mathematical formulation of hyperbolic AdamW and SGD adaptations
- Medium confidence in the experimental results due to limited dataset and model diversity
- Low confidence in the practical significance and generalizability of the improvements

## Next Checks
1. Test the hyperbolic optimizers on multiple real-world datasets across different domains (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, text data) and model architectures (CNNs, transformers) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of hyperbolic time sampling versus hyperbolic parameter updates, and evaluate different hyperbolic manifold geometries (e.g., hyperboloid model).
3. Perform rigorous statistical analysis comparing convergence rates and final performance metrics across multiple random seeds to establish the significance and consistency of observed improvements.
