# GuidNoise: Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for Generalized Noise Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04456
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04456
- Authors: Changjin Kim; HyeokJun Lee; YoungJoon Yoo
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Achieves KLD/AKLD scores of 0.014/0.113 on SIDD-Validation using single guidance pair

## Executive Summary
GuidNoise introduces a novel approach to noise synthesis that addresses the limitations of traditional guided diffusion methods by requiring only a single noisy-clean image pair as guidance. This single-pair guided diffusion framework relaxes the need for extensive paired datasets and camera metadata while maintaining strong performance. The method employs guidance-aware affine feature modification and a noise-aware refine loss to effectively capture noise distributions. By enabling self-augmentation, GuidNoise allows smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models trained on full datasets.

## Method Summary
The core innovation of GuidNoise lies in its ability to perform generalized noise synthesis using minimal guidance data. The method modifies the standard diffusion framework by incorporating guidance-aware affine feature transformation, which adjusts the noise synthesis process based on the characteristics of a single guidance pair. A noise-aware refine loss is introduced to better capture the underlying noise distribution during training. The framework also leverages self-augmentation strategies, where synthesized noisy images are used to enhance model training without requiring additional real noisy-clean pairs. This approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining or improving synthesis quality.

## Key Results
- Achieves KLD/AKLD scores of 0.014/0.113 on SIDD-Validation dataset
- Outperforms NAFlow (0.031/0.131) and NeCA-W (0.048/0.144) on the same benchmark
- Demonstrates strong generalization across multiple noise datasets (SIDD+, PolyU, Nam)
- Enables small models to match or exceed larger models through self-augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by addressing the fundamental limitation of guided diffusion: the need for extensive paired data. By using a single guidance pair, GuidNoise captures the essential characteristics of the noise distribution through its guidance-aware affine feature modification. This allows the model to adapt to specific noise patterns without overfitting to a particular dataset. The noise-aware refine loss ensures that the synthesized noise closely matches the target distribution, while the self-augmentation capability enables the model to generate additional training samples, effectively expanding its knowledge without external data.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Image -> Guidance-Aware Feature Modifier -> Diffusion U-Net -> Noise Synthesis -> Loss Calculation -> Model Update

Critical Path: The most important sequence is the integration of the guidance pair through the affine feature modifier into the diffusion process, followed by the noise-aware refine loss computation.

Design Tradeoffs: The single-pair approach trades data diversity for practicality and efficiency, accepting potential limitations in capturing highly multimodal noise distributions in exchange for dramatically reduced data requirements.

Failure Signatures: Poor guidance pair quality leads to biased noise synthesis; over-reliance on augmentation can cause mode collapse; insufficient model capacity may result in poor generalization across diverse noise types.

First Experiments:
1. Test baseline diffusion model on SIDD-Validation to establish performance floor
2. Implement single-pair guidance with synthetic noise to validate feature modification approach
3. Evaluate self-augmentation effectiveness by comparing model performance with and without augmentation on small datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on representativeness of single guidance pair
- Metrics focus on distributional similarity (KLD/AKLD) rather than perceptual quality
- Limited evaluation on real-world images with mixed or complex noise characteristics
- Self-augmentation effectiveness tied to initial guidance pair quality

## Confidence
- **High**: KLD/AKLD score improvements over baseline methods on SIDD-Validation
- **Medium**: Generalization across different noise datasets
- **Medium**: Self-augmentation effectiveness for small models

## Next Checks
1. Test method performance with multiple guidance pairs to quantify the trade-off between guidance quality and diversity
2. Evaluate perceptual quality using human studies alongside KLD/AKLD metrics
3. Assess performance on mixed noise scenarios combining multiple noise types or sensor-specific artifacts
