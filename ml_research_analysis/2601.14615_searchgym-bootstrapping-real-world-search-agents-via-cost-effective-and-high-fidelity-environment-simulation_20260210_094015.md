# SearchGym: Bootstrapping Real-World Search Agents via Cost-Effective and High-Fidelity Environment Simulation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14615
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14615
- Authors: Xichen Zhang; Ziyi He; Yinghao Zhu; Sitong Wu; Shaozuo Yu; Meng Chu; Wenhu Zhang; Haoru Tan; Jiaya Jia
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieved 42.72% on GAIA benchmark, outperforming web-trained ASearcher by +3.89% with 37.3% fewer search actions

## Executive Summary
SearchGym addresses the high cost and misalignment issues in training real-world search agents by creating a simulated environment with verifiable knowledge graphs and aligned document corpora. The system trains agents via reinforcement learning on synthetic, fictional entities, ensuring they must rely on tool execution rather than parametric memory. This approach achieves strong performance on real-world benchmarks while reducing computational costs by orders of magnitude compared to web-based training.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a knowledge graph and document corpus where every reasoning path is verifiably retrievable before use, eliminating corrupted reward signals. A two-stage curriculum trains agents first on simple QA tasks (1-6 hops) then progresses to complex tasks (6-12 hops) involving parallel and combo reasoning. Agents are trained on fictional entities unseen during pretraining, forcing reliance on search tools rather than internal knowledge. The approach uses GRPO optimization with 8 rollouts per query, achieving stable training through verified data alignment.

## Key Results
- Achieved 42.72% Pass@1 on GAIA benchmark, outperforming web-trained ASearcher (+3.89%)
- Demonstrated 37.3% reduction in search actions while maintaining superior performance
- Showed stable training curves versus web-based methods that exhibited policy collapse
- Validated effective sim-to-real transfer through minimal alignment phase on Wikipedia data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Eliminating corrupted reward signals via a verified, closed-loop environment stabilizes RL training for search agents.
- **Mechanism:** SearchGym constructs a knowledge graph G and corpus D where every reasoning path is verifiably retrievable before use. Edge verification filters out paths where the target document isn't reliably discoverable via search queries (Eq. 1: edge retained only if ≥5/15 queries retrieve the target). This ensures the agent is never penalized for correct reasoning due to data misalignment.
- **Core assumption:** Clean reward signals are the primary bottleneck in search agent RL training; removing them enables stable policy optimization.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "misalignment generates corrupted reward signals that destabilize training by penalizing correct reasoning or rewarding hallucination"
  - [Section 3.1, Edge verifiability]: "This filtering ensures the reasoning path is discoverable via search, decoupling the agent's reasoning capability from stochastic retrieval failures"
  - [Section 5.1, Training stability]: Figure 3 shows SearchGym exhibits "stable, monotonic improvement" while Search-R1 shows "volatility and eventual policy collapse"
  - [corpus]: Related work on Multi-Fidelity Hybrid RL (arXiv:2509.14848) supports that training stability improves with higher-fidelity simulators

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Two-stage curriculum learning enables progressive acquisition of hierarchical search skills, preventing sparse-reward collapse.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 trains on Simple QA (1-6 hops) to master query formulation, document parsing, and sequential evidence. Stage 2 introduces Parallel and Combo QA (6-12 hops) requiring problem decomposition and information synthesis. The curriculum ensures the agent has foundational skills before attempting long-horizon planning.
- **Core assumption:** Complex multi-hop reasoning decomposes into learnable primitives that can be acquired sequentially.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.2]: "To address [sparse rewards destabilizing learning], we employ a two-stage curriculum that leverages the structured difficulty of tasks"
  - [Table 4 ablation]: Removing Stage 2 drops GAIA performance from 42.72% to 28.16%; Mixed Training underperforms explicit curriculum (47.04% vs 52.09% avg)
  - [Section 5, Scalability]: Extending max reasoning depth from 6 to 12 hops yields "substantial gains" on challenging tasks
  - [corpus]: Weak direct corpus support for curriculum learning in search agents specifically

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Training on synthetic, fictional entities forces agents to learn search-tool reliance rather than exploiting parametric memory, enabling sim-to-real transfer.
- **Mechanism:** All entities in SearchGym are fictional (e.g., "Jackerimu Bellator," "Ysox Vorpa"), unseen during pretraining. The agent must execute search actions to resolve any entity—it cannot rely on internal knowledge. This compels robust tool-use patterns that generalize when deployed with real search engines.
- **Core assumption:** The reasoning patterns learned on synthetic entities transfer to real-world information-seeking behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 1]: "by training on synthetic data unseen during pretraining, we compel the agent to rely exclusively on tool execution rather than parametric memory"
  - [Table 3]: SearchGym-trained agents outperform web-trained ASearcher on GAIA (+3.89%) and xbench-DeepSearch (+17.00%) with 37.3% fewer search actions
  - [Section 5.2, SearchGymBench]: Qwen3-8B achieves 40.6% on Complex QA in the held-out synthetic benchmark, "confirming effective acquisition of robust reasoning primitives"
  - [corpus]: MedAgentGym (arXiv:2506.04405) similarly uses synthetic training environments for agentic coding tasks, supporting the paradigm

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradients (specifically GRPO)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses Group Relative Policy Optimization to update the agent's policy based on trajectory rewards. Understanding advantage normalization and the clipped surrogate objective is essential for debugging training instability.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why GRPO normalizes rewards within a group of N trajectories rather than using absolute reward values?

- **Concept: Knowledge Graph Construction (schema-driven, with typed relations)**
  - **Why needed here:** SearchGym's world model W = ⟨G, D⟩ relies on a schema defining entity types, attributes, and cardinality constraints. Understanding this structure is necessary for extending the environment or diagnosing path-sampling failures.
  - **Quick check question:** Given a schema where Person has a 1-1 "spouse" relation, what constraint does this impose on the knowledge graph topology?

- **Concept: Curriculum Learning (task difficulty progression)**
  - **Why needed here:** The two-stage training approach is central to SearchGym-RL's success. Understanding why simpler tasks are prerequisites for complex ones helps diagnose whether a failure is due to insufficient Stage 1 training or premature Stage 2 introduction.
  - **Quick check question:** If an agent achieves 80% accuracy on Stage 1 tasks but 20% on Stage 2, what does this suggest about the curriculum transition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Schema Config → Knowledge Graph Synthesis (entities + edges)
                          ↓
              Edge Verification (retrievability filter)
                          ↓
              Constrained Path Sampling (acyclic, diverse hops)
                          ↓
              QA Synthesis (Simple / Parallel / Combo verbalization)
                          ↓
              Document Corpus Generation (Wikipedia-style pages)
                          ↓
              SearchGym Environment (Meilisearch index + action space)
                          ↓
              SearchGym-RL Training (Stage 1 → Stage 2 curriculum)

- **Critical path:** The edge verification step (Section 3.1, Eq. 1) is the most consequential—if edges aren't verified as retrievable, downstream QA tasks become unsolvable, corrupting rewards. Validate this step first when debugging.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Synthetic vs. real corpus:** Synthetic guarantees solvability and zero API cost, but may not surface edge cases in real web content (ads, paywalls, mixed-language pages). The paper notes 20.64% of Search-R1's real data had quality issues (Table 9).
  - **Dual action space (Search + Access) vs. Search-only:** Search+Access improves GAIA by ~19% relative (Table 4) but requires longer training trajectories and more tokens.
  - **Fictional entities vs. real entities:** Fictional eliminates parametric-memory shortcuts but creates a distribution gap the minimal alignment phase (200 steps on Wikipedia) attempts to bridge.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Policy collapse (Figure 3):** Training reward becomes volatile and drops—caused by corrupted reward signals from data misalignment. Check edge verification coverage.
  - **Stage 2 underperformance:** If GAIA/xbench scores remain low after Stage 2, verify max hop depth is ≥12 and Combo QA proportion is sufficient.
  - **Sim-to-real gap:** If local performance is high but web performance is low, the minimal alignment phase may be insufficient—consider increasing from 200 steps.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate edge verification:** Sample 50 edges from G*, run the 15 verification queries through Meilisearch, confirm ≥5 retrieve the target document. If pass rate <95%, adjust query generation or retrieval parameters.
  2. **Curriculum ablation:** Train three models—(a) Stage 1 only, (b) Mixed training, (c) Full curriculum—on the same compute budget. Compare on SearchGymBench and one external benchmark (HotpotQA). Expected: Full curriculum > Mixed > Stage 1 only.
  3. **Sim-to-real transfer test:** Train on SearchGym, evaluate immediately on GAIA without the minimal alignment phase. Then add the 200-step alignment and re-evaluate. Quantify the delta to confirm whether alignment is necessary or if synthetic training alone transfers.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** Can agents trained in SearchGym generalize to the real web without the "Minimal Alignment Phase"?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Appendix C.6 states, "To bridge the distributional gap... we perform a minimal alignment phase using data derived from open-source benchmarks... but limit execution to only 200 optimization steps."
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the performance gains are solely due to the synthetic reasoning curriculum or if this short, domain-specific fine-tuning on real Wikipedia data (200 steps) is a strictly necessary precondition for the observed Sim-to-Real transfer.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An ablation study evaluating the Qwen2.5-7B agent on GAIA/xbench using a checkpoint saved strictly before the 200-step minimal alignment phase.

- **Question:** Does the rigidity of a schema-driven synthetic environment limit generalization to the unstructured nature of the live Web?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 3.1 states the knowledge graph is built on a "predefined schema S" where "schema defines valid entity types... and relational constraints."
- **Why unresolved:** While SearchGym ensures solvability, the real web lacks such rigid schemas. Agents might overfit to the clean, structured relationships of the synthetic world, struggling with the messy, ambiguous, and conflicting information structures typical of real-world search.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative analysis of agent behavior when encountering "messy" web pages (e.g., forum posts, unstructured blogs) versus the clean, Wikipedia-style documents generated in the synthetic corpus.

- **Question:** Is training on fictional entities sufficient to prevent hallucination on real-world entities during deployment?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 1 states the method "compel[s] the agent to rely exclusively on tool execution rather than parametric memory" by using unseen synthetic data.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper validates reasoning capabilities, but does not deeply analyze if the model still attempts to rely on parametric memory for real-world entities (which it *does* know about) during live deployment, potentially ignoring retrieved evidence in favor of pre-trained hallucinations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A specific evaluation metric tracking the rate of "knowledge conflicts" on live benchmarks—measuring how often the model ignores retrieved real-world context in favor of its internal parametric knowledge.

## Limitations

- Edge verification guarantees may not transfer to real-world search engines with different ranking algorithms
- The 200-step minimal alignment phase may be insufficient for bridging the domain gap between fictional and real entities
- Synthetic environment rigidity may limit generalization to unstructured, messy web content

## Confidence

- **High:** Training stability improvements via edge verification; sim-to-real transfer via synthetic training; quantitative performance gains over baselines
- **Medium:** Curriculum learning benefits; generalizability of synthetic data patterns to real-world queries
- **Low:** Long-term robustness to adversarial or out-of-distribution queries

## Next Checks

1. **Edge verification transferability:** Sample 50 verified edges from the synthetic corpus, query them through a commercial search engine (e.g., Google/Bing), and measure top-K retrieval success rate. Compare against Meilisearch baseline to quantify distribution shift.

2. **Curriculum robustness test:** Train three variants—(a) Full curriculum, (b) Stage 1 only, (c) Mixed training—on a held-out synthetic benchmark with unseen entity types. Measure generalization to ensure curriculum benefits aren't overfitting to the training schema.

3. **Minimal alignment sufficiency:** Vary the alignment phase duration (0, 50, 200, 500 steps) and measure GAIA/xbench performance after each. Determine whether 200 steps is optimal or if longer alignment improves real-world transfer.
