## Executive Summary
BENCHMARKPROFILING is a systematic framework that diagnoses which cognitive abilities LLM benchmarks truly measure. The method operationalizes ten cognitively grounded abilities, generates targeted synthetic diagnostic datasets, and quantifies each ability's contribution via gradient-based importance scoring and targeted parameter ablation. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten benchmarks reveals that benchmarks combine multiple abilities rather than testing single skills, datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, code-generation tasks demand broad multi-skill competence, and irrelevant abilities can negatively impact performance. The framework offers transparent diagnostics for benchmark audit and model interpretability.

## Method Summary
The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute Ability Impact Scores (AIS). First, synthetic diagnostic datasets targeting ten cognitive abilities are generated and validated by experts (92.2% accuracy). For each ability, the model is fine-tuned on its diagnostic dataset to compute importance scores via first-order Taylor approximation (I_j = |∂L/∂θ_j × θ_j|) for MLP parameters. The top 1.024% of MLP weights per ability are zeroed to create ablated models. These ablated models are then evaluated on target benchmarks, and AIS values are computed by normalizing performance drops against each benchmark's chance baseline. AIS near 1 indicates strong dependence, near 0 indicates irrelevance, and negative values indicate detrimental effects.

## Key Results
- Benchmarks combine multiple abilities rather than testing a single skill
- Datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures
- Code-generation tasks demand broad multi-skill competence with modest gains from narrow fine-tuning
- Irrelevant abilities can negatively impact performance (negative AIS on LogiQA and WinoGrande)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Gradient-based importance isolates ability-specific parameters
- **Claim:** If parameters with high gradient magnitude on a diagnostic dataset are critical for that ability, then ablating them should selectively impair that ability
- **Mechanism:** Compute first-order Taylor approximation: `I_j = |∂L/∂θ_j · θ_j|` via fine-tuning on diagnostic dataset Da. Rank all MLP weights, zero top 1.024%. This localizes functional circuits while preserving attention pathways for fluency
- **Core assumption:** Gradient magnitude correlates with causal contribution to ability performance (not just correlation)
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation"; [section 6.2/Table 2] MLP-only ablation yields "modest accuracy drops" while all-layer ablation "slashes performance" and produces "repetitive, incoherent text"
- **Break condition:** If ablating top-k% parameters impairs fluency or damages multiple abilities equally, the importance scoring is not isolating ability-specific circuits

### Mechanism 2: Performance delta normalized by chance yields interpretable AIS
- **Claim:** The Ability Impact Score `AIS = (P_baseline - P_ablated) / (P_baseline - P_chance)` quantifies benchmark reliance on each ability on a comparable scale
- **Mechanism:** Normalize absolute performance drops by each benchmark's improvement-over-chance margin. AIS near 1 = strong dependence; near 0 = irrelevant; negative = detrimental (ablating improves performance)
- **Core assumption:** Linear normalization preserves relative importance across benchmarks with different chance baselines
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3] Formal definition of AIS with interpretation; [section 5/Key Finding 4] Negative AIS values appear on LogiQA and WinoGrande, indicating "abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance"
- **Break condition:** If AIS values are unstable across random seeds, prompt formats, or model scales, the normalization is capturing noise rather than ability structure

### Mechanism 3: Cognitive-grounded ability taxonomy reflects functional decomposition
- **Claim:** Ten abilities derived from CHC theory map onto separable parameter clusters in LLMs
- **Mechanism:** Define abilities (e.g., Deductive Reasoning, Contextual Recall) via cognitive science. Generate synthetic diagnostic datasets targeting each. Expert validation confirms items match intended ability (92.2% accuracy)
- **Core assumption:** Abilities are sufficiently independent that ablating one minimally affects others (dominant association, not orthogonality)
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3/Table 1] Full operationalization of ten abilities with cognitive grounding; [section 6.1] Expert evaluation: 92.2% label accuracy across abilities; [section 5/Figure 4] Jensen-Shannon Similarity (0.53-0.89, mean 0.64) shows cross-model profile consistency
- **Break condition:** If diagnostic datasets correlate highly with each other (i.e., models solve them with same parameters), the taxonomy is not functionally separable

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gradient-based sensitivity analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** The method relies on first-order Taylor approximation to identify important parameters. You need to understand how gradients connect loss landscapes to parameter importance
  - **Quick check question:** Why does `|gradient × parameter|` estimate importance better than gradient magnitude alone?

- **Concept: Ablation as causal intervention**
  - **Why needed here:** The core evidence for ability-benchmark links comes from zeroing parameters and measuring performance drops. This is a causal intervention, not correlation
  - **Quick check question:** If ablating ability A improves performance on benchmark B, what does that imply about the relationship between A and B?

- **Concept: Multi-collinearity in cognitive abilities**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper acknowledges abilities are "correlated but separable" (CHC theory). Understanding why orthogonality is neither feasible nor desirable helps interpret overlap
  - **Quick check question:** If two abilities share 40% variance, how would that manifest in AIS profiles?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Diagnostic Dataset Generator -> Gradient Computer -> Parameter Selector -> Ablator -> Evaluator -> AIS Calculator
- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate and validate diagnostic datasets (expert review: 92.2% accuracy)
  2. Compute gradients on each dataset (25 min on 8×A100 for 7-8B model)
  3. Ablate top-k% MLP parameters (5 min on 1×A100)
  4. Evaluate baseline and ablated models on benchmarks using standard harness (e.g., EleutherAI)
  5. Compute AIS matrix and visualize as radar plots

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **MLP-only vs. all-layer ablation:** MLP preserves fluency; attention ablation destroys coherence. Trade specificity for interpretability
  - **k=1.024% vs. larger:** Smaller k minimizes collateral damage; larger k yields stronger signal but risks widespread impairment. Paper chose smallest k with "clear, ability-specific signal"
  - **Synthetic vs. naturalistic diagnostic data:** Synthetic allows control over ability isolation; naturalistic may better reflect real distributions. Paper validates with expert review

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Ablated model loses fluency:** Attention weights accidentally modified or k too large
  - **AIS values near zero across all benchmarks:** Diagnostic dataset doesn't isolate ability, or gradient computation failed
  - **Negative AIS on benchmarks not designed for adversarial shortcuts:** May indicate spurious cue conflicts (expected only on LogiQA, WinoGrande per paper)
  - **Cross-model profiles diverge (JSS < 0.5):** Architectural differences dominate ability structure; taxonomy may not transfer

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce AIS matrix for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** on subset of benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, ARC-C, HumanEval). Compare to Table 3 values. Deviation >0.1 suggests implementation error
  2. **Ablation sanity check:** Verify MLP-only ablation maintains fluency (generate 10 samples, rate coherence). Compare to all-layer ablation (should degrade, per Table 4)
  3. **k-sensitivity analysis:** Run profiling with k ∈ {0.256%, 0.512%, 1.024%, 2.048%}. Plot AIS stability vs. k. Confirm 1.024% is minimum for clear signal without fluency loss

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method's core assumption—that gradient magnitude on diagnostic datasets identifies ability-specific parameters—lacks independent validation
- Cross-model AIS profile consistency (JSS 0.53-0.89) shows meaningful architectural variation that may limit generalizability
- The 1.024% ablation threshold was empirically determined for 7-8B models but may not generalize to larger models or different architectures
- Negative AIS values appear only on LogiQA and WinoGrande, raising questions about whether the framework can identify detrimental ability contributions beyond these adversarial-style benchmarks

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** AIS normalization mechanism works as specified (AIS values are interpretable and bounded); MLP-only ablation preserves fluency while achieving measurable performance drops; cross-model profile consistency suggests some degree of transferability
- **Medium confidence:** Ten-ability taxonomy reflects functional decomposition in LLMs (expert validation supports construct validity but doesn't prove causal separation); 1.024% threshold represents optimal tradeoff for 7-8B models (empirically determined but not theoretically grounded)
- **Low confidence:** Gradient-based importance scoring isolates ability-specific parameters (no ablation stability analysis across seeds; inter-method attribution variability is well-documented in literature)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation stability analysis:** Repeat profiling with three different random seeds for diagnostic dataset generation and gradient computation. Compute coefficient of variation for AIS values across seeds. CV > 0.1 indicates instability in the importance scoring mechanism
2. **Transferability test:** Apply the same diagnostic datasets and AIS methodology to a completely different architecture (e.g., Mistral 7B or Phi-3-mini). Compare cross-model JSS values and AIS correlations. JSS < 0.5 would suggest the taxonomy doesn't transfer across architectures
3. **Counterfactual ability manipulation:** Generate synthetic inputs that require ability A but explicitly forbid using ability B. Run through baseline and ability-ablated models. If ablating B doesn't improve performance on these inputs, the negative AIS findings may reflect spurious correlations rather than true interference
