# Technical report: Impact of Duration Prediction on Speaker-specific TTS for Indian Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.16875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16875
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Speaker-prompted duration predictor improves speaker similarity across Indian languages, while infilling predictor improves intelligibility for Tamil

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how different duration prediction strategies affect speaker-specific text-to-speech synthesis for Indian languages. The researchers compare two approaches: an infilling-style duration predictor and a speaker-prompted duration predictor. Through experiments on speech infilling tasks across five Indian languages, they find language-dependent trade-offs between intelligibility and speaker similarity. The speaker-prompted predictor consistently improves speaker similarity but shows varying effects on intelligibility across languages, while the infilling predictor generally enhances intelligibility but with less consistent speaker similarity results.

## Method Summary
The study employs two distinct duration prediction strategies in a speaker-specific TTS framework for Indian languages. The infilling-style predictor is trained to predict durations for missing speech segments within longer utterances, while the speaker-prompted predictor uses explicit speaker conditioning to generate durations aligned with target speaker characteristics. Both approaches are integrated into a standard TTS pipeline and evaluated on speech infilling tasks across Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Odia. The evaluation includes both quantitative metrics (WER for intelligibility, Sim-o for speaker similarity) and human perceptual tests (QMOS and SMOS) for Hindi and Tamil.

## Key Results
- Tamil shows significant improvement with speaker-prompted predictor: WER reduced from 0.2806 to 0.2622 and Sim-o improved from 0.6833 to 0.6925
- Speaker-prompted predictor consistently improves speaker similarity across all five tested Indian languages
- Infilling predictor generally enhances intelligibility but shows less consistent speaker similarity results
- Human evaluations (QMOS and SMOS) for Hindi and Tamil confirm quantitative findings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The duration prediction mechanism critically influences how well synthesized speech matches target speaker characteristics while maintaining intelligibility. Speaker-prompted prediction leverages explicit speaker embeddings to generate durations that align with the target speaker's natural rhythm and prosody patterns, explaining its consistent improvement in speaker similarity. The infilling approach, optimized for filling gaps in continuous speech, appears better at maintaining local acoustic coherence, which benefits intelligibility in some languages but may sacrifice speaker-specific timing patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Duration prediction in TTS**: Essential for controlling phoneme timing and rhythm; quick check: verify duration prediction accuracy on held-out test set
- **Speaker embedding conditioning**: Enables speaker-specific synthesis by conditioning model parameters on speaker identity vectors; quick check: test speaker similarity with and without speaker embeddings
- **WER (Word Error Rate)**: Standard metric for measuring speech intelligibility; quick check: compare WER across different duration prediction methods
- **Speaker similarity metrics (Sim-o)**: Quantifies how closely synthesized speech matches target speaker characteristics; quick check: conduct A/B tests comparing similarity scores
- **QMOS/SMOS (Quality/Speaker MOS)**: Human perceptual ratings for speech quality and speaker match; quick check: validate model rankings with human listeners

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Text input -> Text frontend -> Duration predictor -> Acoustic model -> Vocoder -> Speech output

Critical path: Duration prediction directly influences acoustic model input, which determines the final speech characteristics. The duration predictor's accuracy and speaker conditioning determine both intelligibility and speaker similarity outcomes.

Design tradeoffs: The choice between infilling and speaker-prompted predictors involves balancing local acoustic coherence (infilling) versus global speaker consistency (speaker-prompted). Infilling may better preserve local speech patterns but struggle with speaker-specific rhythm, while speaker-prompted excels at speaker identity but may introduce timing artifacts.

Failure signatures: Poor duration prediction manifests as unnatural pauses, timing discontinuities, or speaker identity mismatches. Infilling failures typically show as choppy or misaligned speech, while speaker-prompted failures often result in prosody that doesn't match target speaker characteristics.

First experiments:
1. Compare WER and Sim-o metrics for both predictors on a held-out test set
2. Conduct human listening tests comparing speaker similarity for the two approaches
3. Perform ablation study removing speaker embeddings from the speaker-prompted predictor

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on five Indian languages may not generalize to all language families or other Indian languages
- Findings specific to speech infilling task configuration may not extend to full sentence synthesis or other TTS applications
- Potential confounding factors from overall TTS architecture not fully isolated from duration prediction effects

## Confidence
- High confidence in observed trends within tested languages, particularly consistent speaker similarity improvement with speaker-prompted predictor
- Medium confidence in generalization to other Indian languages beyond the five tested
- Strong support from human evaluation results for Hindi and Tamil

## Next Checks
1. Test duration prediction strategies on additional Indian languages from different language families (Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, etc.) to validate language-specific patterns
2. Evaluate strategies on different TTS tasks beyond speech infilling, such as full sentence synthesis or cross-lingual adaptation
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate duration prediction effects from other model components
