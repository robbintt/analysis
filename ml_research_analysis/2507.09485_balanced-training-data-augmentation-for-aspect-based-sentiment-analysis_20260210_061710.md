# Balanced Training Data Augmentation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.09485
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09485
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: LLM-based balanced data augmentation with RL quality control improves ABSA F1 scores on benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in social media contexts, where short texts, limited training data, and unbalanced label distributions hinder performance. The authors propose a balanced training data augmentation approach that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate additional training data, creating a more balanced dataset for training an ABSA model. To ensure high-quality augmented data, they employ a reinforcement learning approach with a reward function that assesses sentiment consistency and topic relevance. Experiments on four English benchmark datasets (LAP14, REST14, REST15, REST16) demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, achieving superior performance over strong baselines and most existing studies, with accuracy and F1 scores showing significant improvements, particularly in F1 score.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach combines LLM-based data generation with reinforcement learning for quality control. First, an LLM generates synthetic training examples to balance underrepresented classes. Then, a reinforcement learning framework with a custom reward function evaluates and filters the generated data based on sentiment consistency and topic relevance. The final augmented dataset is used to train an ABSA model. The reward function specifically measures whether the generated text maintains consistent sentiment with respect to the aspect and stays relevant to the topic. This two-stage process aims to both balance the training data distribution and ensure high-quality synthetic examples.

## Key Results
- Superior performance over strong baselines and most existing studies on LAP14, REST14, REST15, REST16 datasets
- Significant improvements in F1 scores compared to unbalanced approaches
- Accuracy and F1 scores demonstrate the value of quality augmented data and balanced label distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing two key limitations in ABSA: data scarcity and label imbalance. By using LLMs to generate synthetic examples, the method increases the effective training data size. The reinforcement learning component ensures that only high-quality, relevant examples are retained, preventing the noise that can degrade model performance. The balanced distribution of labels helps the model learn better representations across all classes rather than overfitting to dominant ones. The combination of data augmentation with intelligent filtering through RL creates a virtuous cycle where quality and quantity of training data are both optimized.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Extracting sentiment for specific aspects within text; needed because general sentiment analysis loses fine-grained information; quick check: can identify "food was great but service was poor" as mixed sentiment for different aspects

2. **Reinforcement Learning for Data Quality**: Using reward functions to filter synthetic data; needed because LLM-generated data can be noisy or irrelevant; quick check: reward function must capture both sentiment consistency and topic relevance

3. **Label Imbalance Effects**: Dominant classes overshadow minority classes in training; needed because ABSA datasets often have skewed distributions; quick check: measure class distribution before and after augmentation

4. **LLM Data Generation**: Large language models creating synthetic examples; needed to overcome limited training data; quick check: generated examples should be fluent and contextually appropriate

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Raw Data -> LLM Augmentation -> RL Quality Filter -> Balanced Dataset -> ABSA Model

Critical path: The RL quality filter is the critical path as it determines which generated examples make it to the final training set. Poor quality filtering would undermine both the data augmentation and balancing benefits.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades computational cost (LLM generation + RL filtering) for improved model performance and generalization. Alternative designs could use simpler heuristics for quality filtering, but this would likely reduce effectiveness.

Failure signatures: If the RL reward function is poorly designed, the system might filter out useful examples or retain low-quality ones. If the LLM generates examples that are too similar to training data, the augmentation provides little benefit. If balancing is too aggressive, it might create unrealistic distributions.

3 first experiments:
1. Run the pipeline without RL filtering to quantify the impact of quality control
2. Test with different LLM models to evaluate sensitivity to generation quality
3. Apply the approach to an imbalanced subset of data to measure balancing effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance claims rely on relatively clean benchmark datasets that may not represent real social media complexity
- Limited evaluation scope to restaurant and laptop domains without cross-domain testing
- Lack of transparency in reward function design and computational cost analysis

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| LLM-based augmentation with RL quality control improves ABSA performance | High |
| Performance improvements are significant but lack statistical validation | Medium |
| Generalizability to real-world social media and other domains is uncertain | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on additional diverse datasets including social media platforms with more varied language patterns, informal expressions, and cross-domain reviews to test generalizability beyond restaurant and laptop domains

2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (data augmentation vs. balancing vs. quality control) and include statistical significance testing to validate performance improvements against specific baseline models

3. Implement a cost-benefit analysis comparing the computational overhead of the LLM-based augmentation and reinforcement learning approach against simpler data augmentation techniques, and test the approach's robustness to varying degrees of label imbalance
