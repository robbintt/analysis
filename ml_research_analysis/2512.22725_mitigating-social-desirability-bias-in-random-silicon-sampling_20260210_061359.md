- Primary result: Reformulated prompts most effectively mitigate SDB in LLM-based population sampling

## Executive Summary
This study investigates mitigating Social Desirability Bias (SDB) in LLM-based population sampling, where models tend to produce socially acceptable rather than representative responses to sensitive questions. The researchers tested four prompt-based strategies—reformulated (neutral third-person phrasing), reverse-coded (semantic inversion), priming (rational-mode instruction), and preamble (non-judgmental assurance)—against a baseline replicate condition. Results show that reformulated prompts most effectively improved alignment with human survey data, reducing JS-divergence and increasing response diversity across multiple LLMs. Reverse-coding had inconsistent effects, while priming and preamble generally worsened alignment by increasing response uniformity. Higher decoding temperature minimally improved alignment but did not resolve structural biases. These findings validate neutral question framing as a practical approach for reducing SDB in silicon sampling, enhancing representativeness of LLM-generated survey responses.

## Method Summary
The study uses random silicon sampling with ANES 2020 data to test SDB mitigation strategies. Researchers sample 5,441 synthetic demographic profiles from ANES marginals and condition three LLMs (Llama-8B, Llama-70B, GPT-4.1-mini) with five prompt conditions across 10 sensitive survey questions. The primary metric is Jensen-Shannon Divergence between silicon and human response distributions, computed with bootstrap confidence intervals. Llama-8B uses deterministic decoding, Llama-70B uses classification-based answer selection, and GPT-4.1-mini uses temperature 0. Each response is generated in a fresh session to prevent context leakage.

## Key Results
- Reformulated prompts achieved the largest JSD reduction (-0.143 to -0.349) across models and questions
- Reverse-coding showed inconsistent effects with severe semantic drift on Gender Role questions (JSD increase of 0.75-0.85)
- Priming and preamble strategies increased response uniformity and generally worsened alignment
- Temperature increase from 0 to 1 provided marginal improvement (10-15% JSD reduction) but didn't resolve structural biases
- Llama-70B classification-based decoding successfully avoided refusals while maintaining distributional alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Third-Person Framing Reduces Evaluative Pressure
Neutral, third-person question phrasing reduces LLMs' perception of being evaluated, thereby decreasing social desirability bias. Direct "what do you think" prompts trigger defensive alignment behavior where models default to socially safe answers. Reformulation to "what would this respondent think" removes the first-person evaluative frame, allowing the model to access more diverse response patterns without activating alignment-trained safeguards.

### Mechanism 2: Explicit Sincerity Instructions Backfire
Meta-instructions explicitly encouraging sincerity or analytical reasoning increase response uniformity and worsen SDB alignment. Instructions like "please answer honestly" or "value logic and objectivity" may activate evaluation-awareness in the model, reinforcing socially safe response patterns rather than reducing them.

### Mechanism 3: Stochasticity Mitigates Mode Collapse but Not Structural Bias
Higher decoding temperature provides marginal alignment improvement by reducing mode collapse, but does not address underlying SDB structural issues. Low-entropy decoding (T=0) concentrates probability mass on socially acceptable tokens. Higher temperature allows sampling from broader plausible responses, partially offsetting concentration effects.

## Foundational Learning

- **Social Desirability Bias (SDB)**: Why needed: The entire paper operationalizes SDB as LLMs' tendency to generate socially approved rather than demographically representative answers. Quick check: If an LLM consistently outputs "I support gender equality" regardless of whether it's simulating a conservative or liberal persona, is this SDB or accurate simulation?

- **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JS-divergence)**: Why needed: The paper uses JS-divergence as its primary metric for comparing silicon vs. human response distributions. Understanding that lower values indicate better alignment is essential for interpreting results. Quick check: If JS-divergence between silicon and human distributions is 0.05 for Reformulated vs. 0.10 for Replicate, which condition shows better alignment?

- **Silicon Sampling**: Why needed: The methodology conditions LLMs on demographic profiles and generates synthetic survey responses. This is the core application being improved. Quick check: What's the difference between silicon sampling and simply asking an LLM for its opinion on a topic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Demographic sampling module -> Prompt construction module -> LLM inference layer -> Evaluation pipeline
- **Critical path**: Sample demographic profile from ANES marginals → Construct prompt with question variant → Generate response in isolated session → Aggregate responses and compute JS-divergence → Bootstrap for confidence intervals
- **Design tradeoffs**: Llama-70B classification vs. generation (classification avoids refusals but may miss nuance); Fresh sessions vs. efficiency (prevents context leakage but increases costs); Temperature 0 vs. 1 (deterministic improves reproducibility but may concentrate responses)
- **Failure signatures**: Mode collapse (single answer dominates); Polarization without moderation (extreme options only); Semantic drift in reverse-coding (construct changes)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline replication on all 10 questions to establish SDB presence; 2) Reformulation A/B test on 3-5 sensitive questions measuring JS-divergence and diversity; 3) Temperature sensitivity test comparing Reformulated performance at T=0 vs. T=1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question Order Bias**: How do prompt-based mitigation strategies perform in full-scale sequential survey simulations where "Question Order Bias" and cumulative context affect responses? The study uses "single-item prompting" and doesn't account for "cumulative contextual biases" present in real-world survey sequences.

- **Distinguishing SDB from Lack of Knowledge**: How can social desirability bias be disentangled from a model's lack of accurate internal representations of specific subgroup preferences? Current metrics measure alignment but cannot pinpoint whether a "safe" response stems from normative pressure or "insufficient population knowledge."

- **Topic-Specific Efficacy**: Why does neutral question reformulation yield less improvement for economic topics compared to politically or socially sensitive ones? The paper observes this trend but doesn't establish a causal mechanism for why reformulation efficacy varies by topic category.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies entirely on JS-divergence to a single human dataset (ANES), potentially missing other dimensions of bias
- Reverse-coding showed severe semantic drift on Gender Role questions, suggesting some questions may be unsuitable for semantic inversion
- Temperature effects provide only modest improvements (10-15% JSD reduction), indicating structural rather than purely decoding-related bias
- Classification-based decoding for Llama-70B may not fully capture distributional nuances compared to generation-based approaches

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Reformulated prompts consistently reduce SDB across multiple models and questions
- **Medium confidence**: Temperature effects on SDB mitigation (small but consistent improvements)
- **Medium confidence**: Priming/Preamble strategies generally worsen alignment (though effect varies)
- **Low confidence**: Reverse-coding effectiveness (highly variable, sometimes severe semantic drift)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test reformulated prompts on a different survey dataset (e.g., GSS or Eurobarometer) to verify that improvements generalize beyond ANES.

2. **Semantic drift analysis**: Systematically evaluate reverse-coded items for construct validity by comparing human responses to inverted questions versus original questions.

3. **Demographic subgroup analysis**: Disaggregate results by demographic strata (e.g., age, race, education) to identify whether reformulation benefits are uniform across populations.
