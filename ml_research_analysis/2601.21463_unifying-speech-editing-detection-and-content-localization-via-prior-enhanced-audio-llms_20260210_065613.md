# Unifying Speech Editing Detection and Content Localization via Prior-Enhanced Audio LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.21463
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21463
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: PELM achieves 0.57% EER on HumanEdit and 9.28% EER on AiEdit localization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and localizing speech editing in audio content, where neural editing techniques create highly seamless forgeries that are difficult to identify using existing methods. To tackle this, the authors construct AiEdit, a large-scale bilingual dataset featuring diverse editing operations (addition, deletion, modification) generated using advanced neural speech editing models and LLM-driven semantic tampering. They propose PELM (Prior-Enhanced Audio Large Language Model), a framework that reformulates speech editing detection and localization as an audio question answering task. PELM incorporates word-level probability priors to inject acoustic evidence and an acoustic consistency-aware loss to enforce subtle anomaly detection.

## Method Summary
PELM reformulates speech editing detection and localization as an audio question answering task. It uses Qwen-2.5-Omni-3B as the base model, fine-tuned with word-level probability priors generated by BAM frame detector and MFA alignment, plus an acoustic consistency loss based on centroid clustering. The model is trained on AiEdit dataset with LoRA (r=32, α=64) and full finetuning of last 3 audio encoder layers. Training uses AdamW optimizer (LR=1e-5, cosine scheduler, warmup=0.2) for 5 epochs with batch_size=8.

## Key Results
- PELM achieves 0.57% EER on HumanEdit benchmark localization task
- PELM achieves 9.28% EER on AiEdit localization task
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across detection and localization metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Prior Injection
Injecting external frame-level detection probabilities as text prompts calibrates the reasoning boundaries of Audio LLMs, mitigating "forgery bias" (over-predicting forgeries). A pre-trained frame-level detector (BAM) generates probability scores for audio frames, which are aggregated by word boundaries (via Montreal Forced Aligner) into a structured text prompt. This explicit low-level acoustic evidence constrains the LLM, preventing it from relying solely on semantic context.

### Mechanism 2: Acoustic Consistency Loss
An asymmetric centroid-clustering loss enforces sensitivity to local acoustic anomalies in edited speech while preserving feature compactness in bona fide speech. The loss computes a feature centroid for the audio. For bona fide audio, it minimizes the distance of all frames to this centroid (cohesion). For edited audio, it maximizes the distance of the top-K% most anomalous frames from the centroid (dispersion).

### Mechanism 3: AQA Formulation
Formulating detection as an Audio Question Answering (AQA) task with strict output formatting allows the model to unify detection and precise content localization. Instead of binary classification, the model generates natural language responses (e.g., "Yes, 'bad' was modified in speech."), leveraging the LLM's inherent token-generation capabilities to pinpoint specific words.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Neural Speech Editing vs. Splicing**
  - Why needed: Traditional detection relies on "splicing artifacts" (discontinuities). AiEdit uses neural editing which reconstructs the signal via codecs, leaving only subtle "reconstruction artifacts" similar to compression.
  - Quick check: Does the audio signal show a sharp phase discontinuity at the edit boundary (splicing), or is the modification acoustically seamless but potentially inconsistent in high-dimensional feature space (neural)?

- **Concept: Semantic-Priority Bias in Audio LLMs**
  - Why needed: Base models like Qwen-Audio prioritize understanding *what* is being said over *how* it sounds. They may miss inaudible acoustic manipulations if the sentence logic remains intact.
  - Quick check: If an audio sentence says "I love apples" but the word "hate" is seamlessly dubbed over "love" with perfect prosody, would a standard Audio LLM notice the inconsistency, or just process the semantics?

- **Concept: Feature Centroid Clustering**
  - Why needed: The core loss function relies on vector space geometry. You must understand calculating a mean vector (centroid) and cosine distance to implement the consistency loss.
  - Quick check: In a 768-dimension feature space, does a high average distance of frames from the centroid indicate a "consistent" or "inconsistent" audio stream?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Frame Detector (BAM) + MFA → Word-level Probs → Prior Prompt → LLM Backbone → Next Token Prediction (CE Loss) + Feature Centroid Calculator (Acoustic Loss)

- **Critical path:** The Acoustic Consistency Loss is applied to the Audio Encoder features, while the Prior Prompt influences the LLM Backbone attention. Engineers must ensure the MFA alignment is accurate; misalignment breaks the "Word: Prob" prior.

- **Design tradeoffs:** LoRA vs. Full FT: Full fine-tuning of the Audio Encoder (11.19% params) offers marginal gains over just tuning the last 3 layers (2.27% params) at a massive memory cost. *Recommendation: Start with "Last 3 Layers" full FT + LoRA for rest.*

- **Failure signatures:** Hallucinated Edits (claims edits occurred where they didn't), Semantic Drift (ignores acoustic input and generates response based on text transcript).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Validation: Run Zero-shot Qwen-Audio on AiEdit to confirm "Semantic-Priority Bias"
  2. Prior Ablation: Train PELM without word-level probabilistic prior to quantify performance gap
  3. Loss Validation: Visualize t-SNE of audio features with and without L_audio to verify clustering behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does PELM performance vary when distinguishing neural editing reconstruction artifacts from acoustic degradations typical of real-world communication channels (e.g., low-bitrate codecs or packet loss)? The paper identifies that reconstruction artifacts are acoustically similar to compression distortions encountered in real-world communication scenarios, but doesn't test this specific confusion scenario.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the framework generalize to proprietary or future neural editing architectures not included in the AiEdit training or testing splits? While cross-model performance is evaluated, the field is described as having "rapid advancement" and the dataset relies on currently available models.

### Open Question 3
How does the framework's reliance on the external frame-level probability prior impact robustness when the prior itself is incorrect or adversarial? The paper shows massive performance drops when removing the prior and explicitly warns the LLM to "Treat this report with caution," but doesn't analyze scenarios where the frame-level detector provides corrupted probability scores.

## Limitations
- The mechanism by which the LLM associates specific acoustic anomalies with specific output words remains poorly understood, creating risk of hallucinating wrong edited words
- The prior generation pipeline depends entirely on BAM's accuracy and MFA alignment quality, with no validation of prior quality
- Generalization across editing techniques remains unproven - may have learned patterns specific to training editors rather than truly general acoustic anomaly detection

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Dataset construction methodology and overall AQA formulation are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims of state-of-the-art performance are supported by experimental results but may be dataset-specific
- **Low Confidence**: Assertion that PELM overcomes "semantic drift" and consistently localizes edits to specific words is not empirically validated

## Next Checks
1. Measure MFA-BAM alignment accuracy on held-out validation set to quantify reliability of acoustic evidence injection
2. Analyze false positive cases on HumanEdit to determine if forgery bias has been truly mitigated
3. Evaluate PELM on truly out-of-distribution editing technique (different model not seen in training or test) to measure real-world robustness
