# Gaussian process surrogate with physical law-corrected prior for multi-coupled PDEs defined on irregular geometry

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02617
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02617
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: LC-prior GP achieves prediction errors ~10⁻³, outperforming standard GP by ~1 order of magnitude

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) framework for surrogate modeling of multi-coupled parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) on irregular geometries. The approach combines proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for dimensionality reduction with Gaussian process surrogate modeling, enhanced by physical law corrections through interpolation functions. The method addresses key challenges in surrogate modeling for complex PDE systems by incorporating physics constraints directly into the GP prior.

The framework demonstrates significant improvements over standard GP and DMD-wiNN methods through numerical experiments on reaction-diffusion, miscible flooding, and Navier-Stokes equations. The LC-prior GP achieves prediction errors on the order of 10⁻³ while enabling efficient parameter estimation through Bayesian inference using MCMC sampling.

## Method Summary
The LC-prior GP framework integrates POD-based dimensionality reduction with GP surrogate modeling for multi-coupled parametric PDEs. The approach constructs a low-dimensional POD basis from high-fidelity solution snapshots, then builds a GP surrogate in this reduced space. Physical law corrections are incorporated through interpolation functions that enforce PDE constraints, with RBF-FD methods providing efficient differentiation matrices for irregular domains. The framework enables efficient parameter estimation through Bayesian inference, using MCMC sampling to quantify uncertainty in the model parameters.

## Key Results
- LC-prior GP achieves prediction errors on the order of 10⁻³
- Outperforms standard GP and DMD-wiNN methods by approximately one order of magnitude
- Demonstrates efficient parameter estimation through Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling
- Successfully handles irregular geometries using RBF-FD differentiation matrices

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LC-prior GP framework works by combining the strengths of dimensionality reduction, surrogate modeling, and physics-informed constraints. POD captures the dominant solution modes, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential dynamics. The GP surrogate models the reduced-order system efficiently, while physical law corrections through interpolation functions ensure that the surrogate respects underlying PDE constraints. This integration allows the model to learn from limited high-fidelity data while maintaining physical consistency, leading to improved prediction accuracy and robustness.

## Foundational Learning

**Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**
- Why needed: Reduces high-dimensional PDE solution spaces to lower-dimensional representations
- Quick check: Verify energy capture ratio exceeds 99% for retained modes

**Gaussian Process (GP) Surrogate Modeling**
- Why needed: Provides probabilistic predictions with uncertainty quantification
- Quick check: Ensure kernel hyperparameters are properly optimized

**RBF-FD Methods**
- Why needed: Enables efficient differentiation on irregular geometries
- Quick check: Validate differentiation matrix accuracy against analytical derivatives

**Physical Law Correction**
- Why needed: Enforces PDE constraints within the surrogate model
- Quick check: Monitor residual errors after correction implementation

**Bayesian Inference with MCMC**
- Why needed: Enables parameter estimation with uncertainty quantification
- Quick check: Verify MCMC chain convergence using trace plots and R-hat statistics

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: POD -> GP Surrogate -> Physical Law Correction -> Bayesian Inference

Critical path: High-fidelity data → POD basis construction → Reduced-order GP training → Physical constraint enforcement → Parameter estimation

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances computational efficiency (through POD reduction) against model fidelity (through physical corrections). The RBF-FD method enables handling of irregular geometries but requires careful node distribution and stencil selection.

Failure signatures: Poor POD energy capture leads to inadequate dimensionality reduction. Insufficient physical law corrections result in violation of PDE constraints. Improper MCMC sampling causes unreliable parameter estimates.

First experiments:
1. Test POD energy capture ratio for different numbers of retained modes
2. Validate RBF-FD differentiation accuracy on known analytical functions
3. Compare GP prediction accuracy with and without physical law corrections

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on high-dimensional multi-physics problems with strong nonlinearities is not established
- RBF-FD accuracy depends on node distribution quality and stencil selection
- Physical law corrections may require careful tuning for different PDE types
- Computational efficiency gains may diminish for problems requiring high-fidelity resolution across entire parameter space

## Confidence

High confidence: POD-GP integration methodology is well-established and correctly implemented
Medium confidence: Physical law correction mechanism shows consistent improvement but needs broader validation
Medium confidence: Computational efficiency claims are supported but require testing on more complex problems

## Next Checks

1. Test LC-prior GP on a high-dimensional multi-physics problem with strong coupling between multiple physics models
2. Compare performance against state-of-the-art neural operator methods on identical test problems
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis on RBF-FD node distribution and stencil size impact on surrogate accuracy
