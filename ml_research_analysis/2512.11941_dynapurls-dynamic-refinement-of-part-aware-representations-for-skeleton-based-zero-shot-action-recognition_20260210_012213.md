# DynaPURLS: Dynamic Refinement of Part-aware Representations for Skeleton-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.11941
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11941
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves 89.06% accuracy on NTU RGB+D 120 and 90.04% on NTU RGB+D 120, setting new state-of-the-art records for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition

## Executive Summary
DynaPURLS addresses limitations in skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition by establishing robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refining them at inference time. The framework generates hierarchical textual descriptions via GPT-3, captures fine-grained motion patterns through adaptive attention-based partitioning, and performs test-time adaptation using a confidence-aware memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets.

## Method Summary
DynaPURLS employs a three-stage approach: (1) GPT-3 generates hierarchical textual descriptions at global, body-part, and temporal levels, encoded via CLIP; (2) an adaptive attention-based partitioning module learns soft, context-aware visual-semantic alignment by treating text embeddings as queries over spatio-temporal skeleton features; (3) during inference, a dynamic refinement module adapts semantic embeddings via lightweight affine transformations guided by high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples stored in a class-balanced memory bank. The method is trained using symmetric InfoNCE loss with learnable importance weights, and refinement is performed with Adam optimization at a higher learning rate.

## Key Results
- Achieves 89.06% accuracy on NTU RGB+D 120 and 90.04% on NTU RGB+D 120, setting new state-of-the-art records
- Outperforms baseline PURLS by 9.3% (88.52% vs 79.22%) on NTU RGB+D 60 55/5 split
- Dynamic refinement with memory bank improves performance from 79.22% to 88.52% on NTU RGB+D 60 55/5 split

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-granularity semantic descriptions enable more precise visual-semantic alignment than single global embeddings. GPT-3 generates hierarchical textual descriptions at three levels—global action summaries, body-part-specific movements (head, hands, torso, legs), and temporal phases (start, middle, end). These are encoded via CLIP and aligned with visual features through contrastive learning, allowing transfer of fine-grained motion patterns across classes (e.g., similar arm motions in "shooting a basketball" and "hitting with an object"). Core assumption: Local motion primitives (body-part movements, temporal phases) are shared across semantically distinct actions and can be decomposed via language models.

### Mechanism 2
Adaptive attention-based partitioning outperforms static body-part segmentation for aligning semantics with skeleton features. Instead of rigid joint groupings, cross-modal attention treats text embeddings as queries over all spatio-temporal visual nodes. The attention matrix learns soft, context-aware aggregation—each semantic description attends to its most relevant joints/timestamps regardless of predefined boundaries. Core assumption: Action-relevant joints vary by action and cannot be predetermined; an attention mechanism can learn this mapping from data.

### Mechanism 3
Test-time refinement of semantic embeddings via lightweight affine transformations addresses domain shift in unseen classes. During inference, learnable scale and bias parameters transform static text embeddings. A class-balanced memory bank stores high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples, providing stable supervision for gradient updates. Only the adaptation parameters are updated; the main network remains frozen. Core assumption: High-confidence predictions correlate with correctness; pseudo-labels from confident predictions are reliable adaptation signals.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) vs. Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL)**
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates both settings; GZSL requires balancing seen/unseen class recognition and introduces harmonic mean (H) as the key metric
  - Quick check question: In GZSL, why does harmonic mean penalize models that perform well only on seen classes?

- **Concept: Cross-Modal Attention (Query-Key-Value)**
  - Why needed here: The adaptive partitioning module uses text embeddings as queries attending over visual features; understanding attention weights is essential for debugging alignment
  - Quick check question: If attention weights are uniform across all joints, what does that imply about the learned alignment?

- **Concept: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)**
  - Why needed here: DynaPURLS's core innovation is adapting at inference time; standard training/validation splits don't apply—you must simulate online test streams
  - Quick check question: Why must TTA avoid updating the main backbone to prevent catastrophic forgetting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Skeleton input → Shift-GCN → G → attention(R) → MLP → similarity with text embeddings → prediction → confidence check → memory bank update → refinement loss → S, ΔF update
- **Critical path**: Skeleton input → Shift-GCN → G → attention(R) → MLP → similarity with text embeddings → prediction → confidence check → memory bank update → refinement loss → S, ΔF update. The first forward pass uses static F; subsequent passes use refined F′.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Memory bank capacity K: Small K limits diversity; large K risks accumulating incorrect pseudo-labels. Paper recommends K∈[8,16]
  - Confidence threshold τ: Low τ admits noisy samples; high τ restricts refinement. τ=0.2 works best
  - Refinement learning rate β: Must be higher than training LR (0.01 vs. 1e-4) for fast adaptation, but not so high it destabilizes
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Collapse to seen classes: In GZSL, if U (unseen accuracy) is near zero while S is high, the model hasn't learned transferable alignment
  - Attention uniformity: If attention matrix A shows near-uniform weights across joints, the adaptive partitioning isn't learning meaningful groupings
  - Memory bank imbalance: If certain classes dominate storage, the class-balanced constraint may not be enforced
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce baseline (PURLS) vs. DynaPURLS: Train on NTU 60 55/5 split with static alignment only, then add dynamic refinement. Compare ZSL accuracy
  2. Ablate memory bank: Run refinement with and without class-balanced memory bank. Expect significant drop (88.52% → 78.02%)
  3. Visualize attention patterns: For actions with known part-level similarities, extract attention weights and verify that hand-related queries attend to hand joints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can test-time adaptation frameworks for skeleton-based ZSL effectively prevent error propagation when high-confidence predictions are systematically biased? The current method relies on a confidence threshold to filter samples, but does not distinguish between correct high-confidence predictions and systematic biases towards seen classes, risking the stabilization of incorrect features during online refinement. Demonstrating that integrating uncertainty estimation techniques significantly reduces error accumulation would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
Can replacing the static "start-middle-end" temporal decomposition with a variable-length or hierarchical segmentation scheme improve recognition of actions with complex temporal dependencies? The current model treats temporal segments independently using fixed intervals, which fails to capture sequential dynamics or variable-length phases inherent in different human actions. Ablation studies showing performance improvements on datasets with high temporal variance when using adaptive segmentation would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the performance of DynaPURLS generalize to "in-the-wild" environments given its exclusive evaluation on controlled laboratory datasets? The paper acknowledges that the controlled settings of current benchmarks (lighting, background, demographics) may inflate performance metrics, leaving the model's robustness to naturalistic variability unproven. Evaluating the model on diverse, unscripted skeleton datasets would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on GPT-3 prompt quality and consistency, introducing an external, non-reproducible dependency
- Test-time adaptation reliability critically depends on confidence calibration; poor calibration could cause semantic drift through incorrect pseudo-labels
- Results are limited to specific skeleton benchmarks; generalization to different joint counts, skeletal topologies, or action vocabularies remains untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Multi-granularity alignment mechanism is well-supported by explicit text and ablation evidence
- **Medium confidence**: Adaptive attention-based partitioning lacks direct comparative baselines in the corpus, though performance gains are shown
- **Medium confidence**: Test-time refinement is the most novel component, but its success critically depends on confidence calibration and memory bank management

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation of confidence threshold τ**: Systematically vary τ∈[0.05, 0.3] and measure impact on GZSL H-score and memory bank composition to isolate whether refinement quality depends on strict confidence gating
2. **Attention weight visualization**: For a set of actions with known part-level similarities, extract and visualize attention weight matrices to verify that semantically related body-part descriptions attend to the same joint regions across classes
3. **Memory bank diversity audit**: Log per-class sample counts and feature diversity in the memory bank after adaptation to check for class imbalance or feature collapse, indicating poor pseudo-label quality or overfitting
