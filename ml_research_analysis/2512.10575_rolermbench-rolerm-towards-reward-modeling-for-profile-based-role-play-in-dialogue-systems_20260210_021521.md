# RoleRMBench & RoleRM: Towards Reward Modeling for Profile-Based Role Play in Dialogue Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.10575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10575
- Reference count: 40
- This work introduces RoleRMBench and RoleRM, demonstrating over 24% improvement in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity for persona-grounded role-play dialogue.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning reward models with human judgment in subjective, persona-grounded role-playing dialogue systems. It introduces RoleRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark with seven fine-grained evaluation dimensions, and RoleRM, a reward model trained using Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP). The approach leverages continuous pairwise supervision to capture nuanced human preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that RoleRM outperforms existing models by over 24% on average, particularly excelling in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. The findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and consistent annotation quality for achieving subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a two-fold approach to improve reward modeling for profile-based role play in dialogue systems. First, it introduces RoleRMBench, a benchmark consisting of seven fine-grained evaluation dimensions specifically designed to assess persona-grounded dialogue quality. Second, it presents RoleRM, a reward model trained using Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which employs continuous pairwise supervision to capture subtle human preferences. The model is trained to predict continuous preference scores rather than discrete labels, allowing for more nuanced alignment with human judgment. The evaluation demonstrates that RoleRM achieves substantial improvements over both open- and closed-source models, particularly in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

## Key Results
- RoleRM outperforms existing open- and closed-source models by over 24% on average in persona-grounded dialogue evaluation.
- The model demonstrates significant improvements in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity, the two most challenging dimensions.
- Continuous preference representation and consistent annotation quality are identified as critical factors for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of RoleRM stems from its ability to capture continuous human preferences through pairwise supervision, rather than relying on discrete labels. This continuous representation allows the model to better align with the nuanced and subjective nature of human judgment in role-playing dialogue. By incorporating seven fine-grained evaluation dimensions, RoleRMBench provides a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of persona-grounded interactions. The Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP) training method enables the model to learn from subtle preference signals, resulting in improved narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity compared to traditional reward modeling approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Continuous Preference Representation**: Why needed - To capture the nuanced and subjective nature of human judgment in role-playing dialogue; Quick check - Compare model performance using discrete vs. continuous labels.
- **Pairwise Supervision**: Why needed - To learn relative preferences between dialogue responses rather than absolute quality scores; Quick check - Evaluate model performance with and without pairwise training signals.
- **Fine-grained Evaluation Dimensions**: Why needed - To comprehensively assess the multiple aspects of persona-grounded dialogue quality; Quick check - Analyze model performance across individual dimensions to identify strengths and weaknesses.
- **Annotation Consistency**: Why needed - To ensure reliable training signals for subjective alignment; Quick check - Measure inter-annotator agreement and its impact on model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: RoleRMBench (benchmark) -> CIP training data generation -> RoleRM (reward model) -> evaluation
**Critical Path**: Continuous pairwise supervision generation → RoleRM training → fine-grained evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Continuous preferences provide nuanced alignment but require more complex annotation; seven dimensions offer comprehensive assessment but increase evaluation complexity
**Failure Signatures**: Poor narrative coherence scores indicate issues with context understanding; low stylistic fidelity suggests problems with persona adherence
**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing continuous preference representation, 2) Evaluation on reduced set of dimensions, 3) Training with discrete rather than continuous labels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the generalizability of its approach. These include the extent to which the seven evaluation dimensions capture all relevant aspects of persona-grounded dialogue, the scalability of continuous annotation processes to larger datasets, and the potential for domain adaptation beyond the tested scenarios. The authors also question how well the Continuous Implicit Preferences method transfers to other subjective alignment tasks beyond role-playing dialogue.

## Limitations
- The reliance on Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP) introduces potential subjectivity in continuous supervision signals, as these may not fully capture the diversity of human judgment.
- The evaluation dimensions, while fine-grained, are based on a limited set of dialogue scenarios, which may not generalize to broader conversational contexts.
- The claim of outperforming existing models by over 24% is significant but may be influenced by the specific evaluation setup and dataset characteristics.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The necessity of continuous preference representation and consistent annotation quality for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that RoleRM outperforms existing models by over 24% on average, given the potential variability in evaluation setups and datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the seven fine-grained evaluation dimensions to diverse conversational contexts beyond the tested scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluations to assess the generalizability of RoleRM's performance across different dialogue scenarios and domains.
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of continuous preference representation versus other model components on subjective alignment.
3. Expand the annotation process to include a more diverse set of annotators to evaluate the robustness of continuous supervision signals against varying human judgments.
