- Introduces MultiZebraLogic benchmark with 128+1024 puzzles per language and size

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces MultiZebraLogic, a multilingual logical reasoning benchmark designed to evaluate both reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs across nine Germanic languages. The authors generate zebra puzzles with varying sizes (2×3 and 4×5), 14 clue types, and 8 red herring types to increase difficulty. They find that puzzle size 2×3 is sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (non-reasoning), while 4×5 is suitable for o3-mini (reasoning). Including 5 red herrings reduces o3-mini's puzzle-level accuracy by 15±7% on 4×5 puzzles. Performance is not significantly affected by language (English vs. Danish) or theme (houses vs. smørrebrød). The authors observe no correlation between clue type selection and difficulty. They publish datasets of 128+1024 puzzles per language and size, along with code for puzzle generation. The benchmark fills a gap in multilingual logical reasoning evaluation, providing resources for comparing LLMs' reasoning capabilities across languages and puzzle complexities.

## Method Summary
The authors developed MultiZebraLogic by generating zebra puzzles with two sizes (2×3 and 4×5 grids), 14 distinct clue types including direct comparisons, positional relationships, and logical negations, and 8 types of red herrings to increase difficulty. Puzzles were created in nine Germanic languages including English, Danish, German, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese, and Afrikaans. The generation process involved creating random puzzle configurations, generating clues based on selected clue types, and validating solvability through constraint satisfaction checking. The benchmark was evaluated using GPT-4o mini and o3-mini models across different puzzle sizes, red herring counts, languages, and themes (traditional houses vs. Danish smørrebrød).

## Key Results
- Puzzle size 2×3 provides sufficient challenge for GPT-4o mini while 4×5 challenges o3-mini
- Including 5 red herrings reduces o3-mini's puzzle-level accuracy by 15±7% on 4×5 puzzles
- Performance is not significantly affected by language (English vs. Danish) or theme (houses vs. smørrebrød)
- No correlation observed between clue type selection and puzzle difficulty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MultiZebraLogic works by systematically varying puzzle complexity through grid size, clue diversity, and red herring inclusion while maintaining multilingual consistency. The benchmark leverages the structured nature of zebra puzzles where logical constraints must be satisfied simultaneously, providing a controlled environment to measure reasoning capabilities. By generating puzzles algorithmically, the authors ensure reproducibility and scalability while maintaining consistent difficulty levels across languages. The inclusion of red herrings specifically tests models' ability to filter irrelevant information, a crucial aspect of logical reasoning. The systematic evaluation across multiple language pairs and model types establishes baseline performance metrics for multilingual logical reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zebra puzzle mechanics**: Understanding constraint satisfaction problems where multiple categorical relationships must be logically deduced - needed for puzzle generation and evaluation
- **Multilingual text generation**: Ability to create coherent, solvable puzzles across different Germanic languages - needed to ensure linguistic validity and consistency
- **Red herring integration**: Skill in embedding misleading information that increases difficulty without breaking puzzle solvability - needed to create appropriate challenge levels
- **Statistical evaluation**: Knowledge of significance testing and confidence intervals for comparing model performance - needed to validate experimental results
- **LLM reasoning assessment**: Understanding how different model architectures (reasoning vs. non-reasoning) approach logical deduction tasks - needed for proper benchmark interpretation
- **Puzzle validation algorithms**: Ability to verify that generated puzzles have unique solutions - needed to ensure benchmark quality

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Puzzle generator -> Language translator -> LLM evaluator -> Performance analyzer -> Benchmark repository
**Critical path:** Random puzzle configuration creation → Clue generation (14 types) → Red herring addition (0-8) → Puzzle validation → LLM evaluation → Accuracy measurement
**Design tradeoffs:** Algorithmic generation vs. human-curated puzzles (scalability vs. authenticity), multiple languages vs. depth per language (breadth vs. focused analysis), simple vs. complex clue types (accessibility vs. challenge level)
**Failure signatures:** Non-unique solutions indicate generation algorithm errors, inconsistent performance across languages suggests translation issues, high variance in red herring impact suggests puzzle difficulty scaling problems
**3 first experiments:** 1) Test single puzzle across all nine languages to verify translation consistency, 2) Evaluate model performance on 2×3 puzzles without red herrings to establish baseline, 3) Measure accuracy drop when adding one red herring type incrementally

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark covers only nine Germanic languages, limiting applicability to other language families
- No correlation between clue type selection and difficulty may reflect insufficient statistical power
- Lack of human-verified ground truth for puzzle solutions introduces uncertainty about absolute accuracy measurements

## Confidence
- Puzzle size difficulty calibration: **High** - multiple systematic experiments across models and languages
- Red herring impact quantification: **Medium-High** - statistically significant but with notable variance
- No clue-type correlation finding: **Medium** - negative result requiring larger sample sizes for robust validation
- Language independence of performance: **Medium** - limited to nine closely-related Germanic languages

## Next Checks
1. Expand puzzle generation to include Romance and Slavic language families to test language family effects
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to establish ground truth accuracy and validate automated scoring
3. Increase puzzle sample sizes per configuration to 500+ to test statistical significance of clue-type difficulty correlations
