# LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.13302
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13302
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: OSST-based methods outperform LLM prompting baselines and match contrastively trained models without labeled data.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces OSST-based methods, a family of unsupervised approaches to authorship attribution and verification that leverage the causal language modeling (CLM) pre-training of modern LLMs. The method uses in-context few-shot style transfer, computing style similarity via LLM log-probabilities after neutralizing text style. OSST-based methods substantially outperform LLM prompting baselines at similar model sizes and exceed contrastively trained models when controlling for topical overlap. Performance improves with model size and scales effectively for both attribution and verification tasks across multiple languages and datasets. A key contribution is the ability to perform flexible, resource-aware authorship analysis without labeled data or spurious semantic correlations.

## Method Summary
The method uses a two-stage approach: (1) neutralize input text using an instruction-tuned LLM with a specific prompt to remove style markers while preserving semantics, and (2) compute OSST scores via in-context learning using a template that compares neutral and styled versions of texts. For attribution, average OSST scores across candidate texts. For verification, use normalized variants (nOSST-ZS or nOSST-RS) that adjust for text length and style differences. The approach is evaluated on PAN competition datasets spanning fanfiction, corporate emails, StackExchange posts, and Reddit, with preprocessing including truncation to 384 tokens and removal of non-alphabetic lines.

## Key Results
- OSST-based methods outperform LLM prompting baselines (LIP, PromptAV) at similar model sizes
- OSST exceeds STAR (contrastive baseline) when controlling for topical overlap in PAN23/24 Task 3
- Performance improves with model size and scales effectively across 15+ datasets and multiple languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OSST leverages the causal language modeling pre-training of LLMs to extract style information through log-probability scoring. By neutralizing text style first, it isolates genuine authorial characteristics from topical content, avoiding the spurious correlations that plague traditional semantic approaches. The in-context few-shot style transfer allows the model to learn what constitutes "style" through comparison rather than requiring labeled examples. This creates a flexible, resource-efficient pipeline that can adapt to different authorship tasks without retraining.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**: LLM training objective predicting next tokens; needed for log-probability scoring, check by verifying model supports logprobs=True
- **Style neutralization**: Removing stylistic markers while preserving semantics; needed to isolate authorship from content, check by comparing neutralized vs original vocabulary
- **In-context learning**: Few-shot prompting without parameter updates; needed for flexible adaptation, check by testing template format with different text pairs
- **Log-probability scoring**: Using negative log-likelihood as similarity metric; needed for style comparison, check by computing scores for identical vs different author pairs
- **Anchor-based normalization**: Using reference texts to standardize scores; needed for verification robustness, check by sampling anchors and comparing score distributions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Neutralization model -> Style transfer template -> Log-probability extraction -> Score aggregation/normalization -> Attribution/verification decision

**Critical path:**
Text preprocessing → Neutralization → OSST scoring → Threshold decision (verification) or candidate ranking (attribution)

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Model size vs. computational cost: Larger models improve accuracy but increase inference time
- Anchor selection vs. generalization: In-distribution anchors improve verification but limit domain flexibility
- Neutralization strength vs. semantic preservation: Stronger neutralization may remove useful style markers

**Failure signatures:**
- Poor performance on topic-controlled datasets indicates leakage of semantic content during neutralization
- nOSST-ZS instability across text lengths suggests position-dependent score patterns
- Cross-domain threshold transfer failures indicate distributional shift issues

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test neutralization effectiveness by comparing vocabulary overlap between original and neutralized texts
2. Verify OSST scoring by computing scores for identical vs different author pairs
3. Validate anchor normalization by checking score distribution consistency across different text lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do OSST-based methods perform when scaling base models beyond 24B parameters, and does the observed performance trend show diminishing returns or continued improvement?
- Can alternative anchor selection mechanisms, specifically contrastively trained retrieval models, effectively replace the requirement for in-distribution anchors in the nOSST-RS variant?
- How robust is the nOSST decision boundary under extreme distribution shifts, such as significant text length disparities or domain changes (e.g., fiction vs. corporate email)?

## Limitations
- Exact implementation details of neutralization pipeline and anchor selection are underspecified
- Performance improvements with model size lack analysis of computational trade-offs
- Reliance on in-distribution anchors for nOSST-RS limits real-world applicability
- No exploration of alternative neutralization prompts or ablation studies

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core OSST methodology effectiveness over prompting baselines; superiority of nOSST-RS over nOSST-ZS; general scalability pattern
- **Medium confidence**: Specific magnitude of improvements; generalization across all datasets; advantage over STAR in topic-controlled settings
- **Low confidence**: "No labeled data" claim when anchors require training distribution; robustness of cross-domain threshold transfer

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation studies testing alternative neutralization prompts and decoding strategies to verify optimal configuration
2. Evaluate OSST performance using only zero-shot scores (no anchors) to test minimum data requirements
3. Conduct computational cost analysis comparing OSST inference time and memory usage against STAR across different model sizes
