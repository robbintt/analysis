- Existing SSL methods underperform traditional FreeSurfer biomarkers; R-NCE improves AD classification and genetic association

## Executive Summary
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in medical imaging but often underperforms established biomarkers. This paper demonstrates that traditional FreeSurfer-derived features outperform existing SSL methods for Alzheimer's disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction. To address this gap, the authors introduce Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a novel SSL framework that incorporates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while learning additional augmentation-invariant information. R-NCE shows superior performance across multiple benchmarks and produces Brain Age Gap (BAG) measures with high heritability and genetic associations linked to neurodegenerative processes.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), an SSL framework that combines traditional FreeSurfer-derived features with contrastive learning in a residual space. The method uses a patch-based 3D CNN architecture with a Vision Transformer aggregator, applying R-NCE loss at both patch and image levels. The approach forces the model to capture all FreeSurfer-derived features while learning additional augmentation-invariant information in a complementary subspace, resulting in representations that outperform both generic SSL methods and traditional features across AD classification, conversion prediction, and genetic association tasks.

## Key Results
- R-NCE outperforms both traditional FreeSurfer features and existing SSL methods for AD classification and conversion prediction
- R-NCE-BAG shows high heritability (h² = 0.42) and associations with MAPT and IRAG1 genes
- R-NCE demonstrates significant improvement in 2- and 3-year AD conversion prediction (p < 0.0001)
- R-NCE-BAG enrichment in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes indicates sensitivity to neurodegenerative processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The R-NCE loss forces the model to capture all FreeSurfer-derived features while learning additional augmentation-invariant information in a complementary subspace.
- Mechanism: A standard NCE contrastive loss is applied in a residual space ($R' = H - P_A[H]$), which is mathematically orthogonal to the auxiliary FreeSurfer feature space (A). A reconstruction loss ($||A - P_H[A]||_F$) ensures the learned representation $H$ spans the auxiliary space $A$. This dual-objective prevents the SSL from ignoring established biomarkers while enabling discovery of novel signal in the orthogonal residual.
- Core assumption: FreeSurfer features contain significant, non-redundant disease signal that generic SSL misses, but there is additional signal in raw images not captured by FS.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...R-NCE, a novel SSL framework that incorporates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while maximizing additional augmentation-invariant information."
  - [methods, Section 4.2 R-NCE] "By minimizing the norm of $R$, we ensure all the information in $A$ is already in a subspace of $H$. By applying the NCE loss on $R'$, we ensure the joint entropy in the remaining space... contains maximal information."
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence for this specific residual contrastive mechanism. Most related papers focus on general multimodal fusion or different SSL variants (e.g., spatiotemporal graph learning).
- Break condition: Fails if FreeSurfer features are too noisy for reliable reconstruction or if the projection does not effectively isolate the residual, leading to information leakage or loss of novel signal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A hierarchical architecture enables high-resolution, location-specific feature learning which is aggregated into a global representation.
- Mechanism: Separate 3D CNN encoders process patches from 18 anatomical regions. A Vision Transformer (ViT) aggregates these patch representations using self-attention and learned positional encodings. The R-NCE loss is applied at both patch (using regional FS features) and aggregate image levels. This preserves local anatomical details crucial for AD while learning global interactions.
- Core assumption: AD pathology has both local (regional atrophy) and global structural signatures that a global model alone might miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [methods, Section 4.1 Patch-Based Model] "Using patches allows us to maintain high spatial resolution without needing to down-sample the image... learned positional encodings corresponding to patch location $l$ are added..."
  - [methods, Section 4.5 Model Training] "The loss $L$ is applied at both patch ($L_1, L_2, ..., L_{18}$) and image ($L_{img}$) levels."
  - [corpus] "Multimodal Fusion of Regional Brain Experts" supports the value of location-specific processing, aligning with the regional expert assumption.
- Break condition: Fails if patch boundaries don't align with relevant anatomy or if the transformer aggregation learns trivial interactions, resulting in a weak bag-of-patches model.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: R-NCE-derived Brain Age Gap (BAG) serves as a more heritable and genetically-enriched endophenotype for neurodegeneration than generic SSL or raw FS features alone.
- Mechanism: By training an age predictor on a large normative dataset using R-NCE representations, the model quantifies accelerated brain aging (BAG = predicted - chronological age). The superior performance of R-NCE-BAG in GWAS (higher heritability $h^2=0.42$, enrichment in astrocytes/oligodendrocytes) indicates the representation captures genetic markers of cellular processes linked to AD risk.
- Core assumption: Brain Age Gap is a valid proxy for general brain health. Stronger genetic associations validate the biological meaningfulness of an imaging biomarker.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "R-NCE-BAG shows high heritability and associations with MAPT and IRAG1, with enrichment in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes..."
  - [results, Section 2.4] "The highest genetic correlation is between R-NCE-BAG and FS-BAG ($r=0.88$)... Oligodendrocytes are most enriched in brain and spine..."
  - [corpus] "Combining imaging and shape features..." supports the premise that hybrid feature approaches can improve prediction. "OPTIMUS" focuses on multivariate outcomes from multimodal data, aligning with the endophenotype concept.
- Break condition: Fails if the BAG model overfits to scanner artifacts or age confounds in training data, or if genetic associations are spurious due to inadequate population stratification controls.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contrastive Learning (NCE)**
  - Why needed here: The core SSL technique. R-NCE modifies the standard NCE loss.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the NCE loss pushes representations of augmented views from the same image closer together while pushing representations from different images apart?

- Concept: **Projection & Orthogonalization**
  - Why needed here: Central to isolating the "residual" information in R-NCE.
  - Quick check question: Given a data matrix $H$ and an auxiliary matrix $A$, what does the residual $H - P_A[H]$ represent? (Answer: The component of $H$ orthogonal to the column space of $A$.)

- Concept: **Brain Age Gap (BAG)**
  - Why needed here: The primary downstream biomarker evaluated. Understanding BAG as a normative deviation score is key to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: If a subject has a Brain Age Gap of +5 years, what does that signify? (Answer: Their brain structure resembles someone 5 years older, suggesting accelerated aging.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: T1 MRI images -> FreeSurfer recon-all (FS features + skull-strip) -> ANTs registration to MNI-152 -> 18 overlapping patch extraction -> 18 separate 3D CNN encoders (13 conv layers, ELU) -> 64-dim patch vectors -> 3-layer Vision Transformer (2 heads/layer) with positional encodings -> 64-dim image representation -> R-NCE Head (reconstruction + NCE in residual space)

- Critical path:
  1. Data -> 18 patches + regional FS features
  2. **Stage 1 (Patch):** Each patch encoder trained with R-NCE using corresponding regional FS features as auxiliary
  3. Freeze patch encoders
  4. **Stage 2 (Image):** Train Transformer aggregator with R-NCE using aggregated FS features as auxiliary
  5. **Evaluation:** Train linear probes on frozen representations or use for BAG calculation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Patch-based vs. Whole-image:** Patches preserve resolution but increase complexity (18 encoders). Whole-image is simpler but requires downsampling.
  - **Generic vs. Guided SSL:** Generic (SimCLR) is flexible but underperforms FS. Guided (R-NCE) outperforms but requires auxiliary features at train time.
  - **Reconstruction vs. Contrastive:** Reconstruction preserves pixel detail; contrastive captures invariant semantics. R-NCE attempts to combine both.

- Failure signatures:
  - **Stagnant NCE loss with high reconstruction loss:** Model failing to learn residual information; check gradient flow into residual branch.
  - **High reconstruction loss on FS features:** Representation $H$ not spanning auxiliary space $A$; increase capacity or check projection implementation.
  - **Low performance on conversion prediction but high on age:** Model learning generic aging features, not disease-specific atrophy.
  - **Overfitting on BAG MAE:** Brain age predictor fitting to noise/artifacts; check for data leakage (longitudinal splits) or scanner confounds.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline Comparison:** Train SimCLR, Barlow Twins, and a linear probe on raw FS features on the same ADNI split. Confirm the paper's finding that FS outperforms generic SSL.
  2. **Ablation on Auxiliary Info:** Train R-NCE with a) No auxiliary info (reverts to SimCLR), b) Only regional volumes, c) Full FS features (thickness + volume). Quantify the gain from domain knowledge.
  3. **BAG Sanity Check:** Train a simple age predictor on UKB using R-NCE frozen features. Plot predicted vs. chronological age. Check for bias across age groups (regression to the mean).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can R-NCE be effectively applied to other imaging modalities, such as diffusion MRI or PET, to outperform their respective traditional features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest "Future work might apply R-NCE to diffusion MRI... or to PET imaging" using auxiliary features like anisotropy or regional uptake.
- Why unresolved: The study only validated R-NCE on T1-weighted structural MRI, leaving its utility in capturing microstructural or metabolic information untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking R-NCE against traditional diffusion or PET metrics on disease classification tasks in independent datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does R-NCE maintain its performance advantage over traditional biomarkers in non-AD neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease or psychosis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state the method "should be applied to prediction of other neurological conditions including Parkinson's Disease or psychosis."
- Why unresolved: The current study focused exclusively on Alzheimer's disease cohorts, and it is unclear if the FreeSurfer-augmented features generalize to pathologies with different structural signatures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating R-NCE features against FreeSurfer on classification tasks for Parkinson's or psychosis using relevant clinical datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does supervised fine-tuning of R-NCE representations yield significant performance gains over the frozen linear-probe setting used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "future work could explore fine-tuning R-NCE representations for disease-specific downstream tasks."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluated representations using a frozen encoder to assess generalizability, but did not test the potential improvements from end-to-end task-specific optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing the performance delta between frozen linear probes and fine-tuned models on AD conversion prediction.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Do the specific genetic variants and cell-type enrichments identified in R-NCE-BAG (e.g., in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) represent causal biological mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "biological mechanisms driving differences between BAG measures warrant deeper investigation" and could be "probed through molecular validation."
- Why unresolved: The study established statistical associations (GWAS and enrichment) but did not perform functional validation to confirm the biological pathways.
- What evidence would resolve it: Molecular validation or multimodal integration studies confirming the functional impact of identified variants (e.g., near MAPT and IRAG1).

## Limitations
- The R-NCE mechanism relies heavily on the quality and completeness of FreeSurfer features, which may not be available in all clinical settings
- Lack of ablation studies on auxiliary information component makes it difficult to isolate the contribution of the residual contrastive loss versus domain knowledge incorporation
- The study only validated R-NCE on T1-weighted structural MRI, leaving its utility in capturing microstructural or metabolic information untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core finding that existing SSL methods underperform traditional FS biomarkers for AD classification and prediction tasks
- **Medium confidence** in the R-NCE mechanism's superiority, as the lack of ablation studies on auxiliary information component makes it difficult to isolate the contribution of the residual contrastive loss
- **Medium confidence** in the biological interpretability of R-NCE-BAG, as the genetic associations with MAPT and IRAG1 genes, and enrichment in astrocytes/oligodendrocytes, are promising but require validation in independent cohorts and functional studies to confirm causality

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation on Auxiliary Features**: Systematically remove components of the FS auxiliary features (regional volumes only, thickness only, full features) to quantify the contribution of domain knowledge to R-NCE's performance.
2. **External Validation on Diverse Cohorts**: Test R-NCE-BAG on independent AD cohorts from different sites and scanners, including underrepresented populations, to assess generalizability and check for potential biases.
3. **Functional Validation of Genetic Associations**: Conduct follow-up studies using single-cell RNA sequencing or in vitro experiments to validate whether the identified genetic markers (MAPT, IRAG1) directly influence the cellular processes (astrocyte/oligodendrocyte function) implicated by R-NCE-BAG.
