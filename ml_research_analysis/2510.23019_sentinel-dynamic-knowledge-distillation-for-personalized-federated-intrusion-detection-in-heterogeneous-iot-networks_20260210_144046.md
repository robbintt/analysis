# Sentinel: Dynamic Knowledge Distillation for Personalized Federated Intrusion Detection in Heterogeneous IoT Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23019
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23019
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 78.22% macro F1-score under extreme non-IID conditions (α=0.1), outperforming 11 state-of-the-art federated methods

## Executive Summary
Sentinel addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and communication overhead in federated intrusion detection for IoT networks through a novel dual-model architecture. Each client maintains a personalized teacher model trained on local data and a lightweight student model that is aggregated globally, significantly reducing communication costs. The framework employs adaptive bidirectional knowledge distillation with dynamic temperature scaling, lightweight feature alignment, and class-balanced loss functions to handle class imbalance and non-IID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate Sentinel's superiority over existing methods while maintaining efficient communication.

## Method Summary
Sentinel introduces a dual-model architecture where each client trains a personalized teacher model on local data and a lightweight shared student model. The framework uses adaptive bidirectional knowledge distillation with dynamic temperature scaling, lightweight feature alignment to bridge representational gaps between heterogeneous models, and class-balanced loss functions to handle imbalanced data. The server employs normalized gradient aggregation (FedNGA) with equal client weighting to ensure fairness and stability. The system is evaluated on IoTID20 and 5GNIDD datasets with extreme non-IID partitioning (α=0.1) across 10 clients.

## Key Results
- Achieves 78.22% macro F1-score under extreme non-IID conditions (α=0.1)
- Outperforms 11 state-of-the-art federated methods on IoT intrusion detection tasks
- Maintains efficient communication by only sharing lightweight student model parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation
The system decouples local personalization from global consensus by maintaining separate teacher and student models. The bidirectional KL-divergence loss uses agreement (γ) and confidence (δ) weights to determine when the teacher should correct the student versus when the student can refine the teacher. This approach handles non-IID data without forcing a single global model fit.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Component Feature Alignment
A lightweight alignment module projects teacher features into the student's feature space, enforcing geometric (MSE), directional (cosine), and structural (contrastive) constraints. This enables robust knowledge transfer between heterogeneous model architectures, ensuring the student understands the teacher's feature distribution even when architectures differ in capacity.

### Mechanism 3: Normalized Gradient Aggregation
FedNGA prevents client drift and unfair dominance by normalizing gradient updates to unit length before aggregation. This ensures no single client, regardless of data distribution or batch size, overwhelms the global update. The server follows the direction of updates rather than their magnitude, maintaining stability in non-IID settings.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Distillation (KD)**: The bridge between isolated Teacher and shared Student models. Understanding temperature scaling and KL-divergence is essential for implementing the bidirectional loss logic.
  - *Quick check*: If distillation temperature (T) is set to 1.0 instead of 3.0, what happens to the "dark knowledge" being transferred?

- **Statistical Heterogeneity (Non-IID)**: The architecture exists to solve feature skew and label distribution skew problems. Distinguishing between label imbalance (few samples) and non-IID (different distributions) is crucial for tuning Class-Balanced Loss vs. KD Loss.
  - *Quick check*: Why would standard FedAvg cause the global model to drift when data is Non-IID?

- **Contrastive Learning**: Used in the structural alignment component. Understanding how memory banks store negative samples to prevent feature collapse is essential.
  - *Quick check*: In the structural loss, why maximize similarity with student features while repelling memory bank features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw Data → Teacher/Student → Aligner → Loss Calculation → Student Update Only → Server Aggregation
- **Critical path**: Forward pass through both models → feature projection and matching → dynamic weight calculation → backpropagation → student parameter transmission
- **Design tradeoffs**: Symmetric (Sentinel-I) reduces alignment complexity but limits capacity; Asymmetric (Sentinel-II) boosts performance but requires alignment module
- **Failure signatures**: KD collapse if agreement hits 100% instantly; gradient instability from improper class weights; slow convergence from excessive alignment emphasis
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Sanity check on IID data (should match FedAvg performance), 2) Stress test on Dirichlet α=0.1 (FedAvg fails ~13% F1, Sentinel >70% F1), 3) Ablation by disabling feature alignment (performance drops significantly in asymmetric variant)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does Sentinel perform in asynchronous federated learning environments with varying client availability and network latency? The current evaluation assumes synchronous updates with all clients participating in every round. Evidence would require experiments measuring convergence speed and F1-scores under simulated asynchronous conditions.

### Open Question 2
Can integrating prototype-based learning enhance personalization capabilities compared to the current logit-based distillation? The paper notes this as future work. Evidence would come from a comparative study evaluating communication overhead and detection accuracy of prototype-based variants.

### Open Question 3
How resilient is the normalized gradient aggregation mechanism against targeted model poisoning attacks? While FedNGA is cited for Byzantine robustness, experiments focus only on statistical heterogeneity without evaluating adversarial scenarios. Evidence would require evaluating model stability when clients perform label-flipping or gradient ascent attacks.

## Limitations

- Exact architecture of the LightweightAligner module is underspecified, making precise reproduction difficult
- Memory bank implementation details (size, update frequency) are not provided
- Performance claims are heavily dependent on specific Dirichlet partitioning and temperature schedules
- Limited evaluation of robustness against adversarial attacks or asynchronous settings

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Dual-model architecture with bidirectional KD, class-balanced loss implementation, normalized gradient aggregation mechanism
- **Medium Confidence**: Feature alignment effectiveness across heterogeneous architectures, server-side momentum update stability
- **Low Confidence**: Exact memory bank dynamics, optimal λ scheduling for dynamic adaptation, sensitivity to initialization

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture ablation test**: Compare Sentinel-I vs. Sentinel-II to isolate alignment module contribution
2. **Gradient norm stability**: Monitor ℓ₂ norms across federated rounds to verify FedNGA prevents client drift
3. **Class-wise breakdown**: Examine per-class F1 scores to validate class-balanced loss effectiveness on minority attacks
