# Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest Path Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.04594
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04594
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Establishes first regret lower bounds for decentralized multi-agent stochastic shortest path problems under linear function approximation, showing any decentralized algorithm suffers Ω(√K) regret over K episodes

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes the first regret lower bounds for decentralized multi-agent stochastic shortest path (Dec-MASSP) problems under linear function approximation. The authors overcome significant challenges including exponential state space, coupled dynamics, and intractable value functions by constructing hard-to-learn instances where optimal policies remain tractable. The main result shows that any decentralized learning algorithm suffers Ω(√K) regret over K episodes, matching previously reported upper bounds up to constant and logarithmic factors. This work characterizes the fundamental learning complexity in decentralized control and provides insights for designing efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a novel construction of hard-to-learn instances for Dec-MASSP problems that balances tractability of optimal policies with the inherent challenges of exponential state space and coupled dynamics. They employ linear function approximation techniques and carefully analyze the regret behavior of decentralized algorithms on these constructed instances. The approach involves characterizing the structural properties of optimal policies that remain tractable while ensuring the instances are sufficiently challenging for any decentralized learning algorithm to achieve sub-√K regret.

## Key Results
- Establishes Ω(√K) regret lower bound for decentralized multi-agent stochastic shortest path problems
- Matches previously reported upper bounds up to constant and logarithmic factors
- Recovers single-agent results as a special case, demonstrating increased difficulty in multi-agent settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by constructing specific problem instances that are both hard to learn for decentralized algorithms and tractable for optimal policy computation. The linear function approximation framework allows the authors to maintain computational tractability while capturing the essential coupling between agents' dynamics. The Ω(√K) lower bound emerges from the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation in decentralized settings, where agents must coordinate without centralized communication.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Hard Instance Construction -> Regret Analysis -> Lower Bound Proof -> Single-Agent Recovery

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from constructing hard-to-learn instances through regret analysis to establishing the lower bound, with the single-agent recovery serving as a validation step.

### Design Tradeoffs
The main tradeoff involves balancing instance hardness with optimal policy tractability. The authors chose linear function approximation to maintain computational feasibility while ensuring the constructed instances remain challenging for decentralized algorithms.

### Failure Signatures
Potential failures include: constructed instances being too easy for sophisticated decentralized algorithms, incorrect characterization of optimal policies, or flawed regret analysis that doesn't properly account for decentralized constraints.

### First Experiments
1. Verify constructed instances are indeed hard by testing against baseline decentralized algorithms
2. Validate optimal policy tractability through explicit computation on sample instances
3. Compare single-agent and multi-agent performance to confirm increased difficulty

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The lower bound construction relies on specific assumptions about linear function approximation
- Results may not extend to non-linear function approximation settings
- The paper focuses on regret without addressing computational complexity of achieving the lower bound

## Confidence

### Major Claim Cluster
- Ω(√K) regret lower bound for decentralized algorithms: Medium confidence
- Matching previously reported upper bounds: High confidence
- Characterization of fundamental learning complexity: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Verify the construction of hard-to-learn instances through detailed case analysis and simulation to ensure they are indeed challenging for decentralized algorithms.

2. Conduct empirical validation of the regret lower bound by comparing it against the performance of state-of-the-art decentralized learning algorithms on the constructed instances.

3. Extend the analysis to non-linear function approximation settings to determine if the Ω(√K) lower bound holds or if it can be improved.
