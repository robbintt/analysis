# Rationale-Augmented Retrieval with Constrained LLM Re-Ranking for Task Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05131

- Key result: Achieves Hit@5 = 0.94 and MRR = 0.85 on Head Start program management task discovery

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of semantic task discovery in enterprise software systems where users struggle to find appropriate modules due to domain-specific jargon and system-specific nomenclature. The proposed solution combines a rationale lexicon extracted from existing test cases, a hybrid pre-filter using deterministic scoring functions, and a constrained LLM re-ranker that guarantees hallucination-free outputs. The system demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional lexical search methods, achieving high precision and recall metrics on a test set of 80+ queries from Head Start program management scenarios.

## Method Summary
The core approach is a training-free retrieval framework that integrates three complementary components. First, a rationale lexicon is automatically extracted from existing test cases to capture semantic relationships between user queries and system modules. Second, a hybrid pre-filter employs deterministic scoring functions to efficiently narrow down candidate modules before expensive LLM processing. Third, a constrained LLM re-ranker processes the pre-filtered shortlist to provide semantic understanding while maintaining output reliability through explicit constraints. This architecture enables effective task discovery without requiring additional training or annotation budgets, making it practical for real-world enterprise deployments.

## Key Results
- Hit@5 = 0.94 and MRR = 0.85 on 80+ test queries from Head Start program management
- Significant improvement over lexical search baselines in semantic coverage
- Training-free approach that leverages existing test cases and pre-trained models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system succeeds by addressing the fundamental mismatch between user intent and system terminology through semantic augmentation. The rationale lexicon bridges this gap by capturing the relationships embedded in existing test cases, effectively translating between user language and system modules. The hybrid pre-filter reduces computational overhead by eliminating clearly irrelevant candidates before LLM processing, while the constrained re-ranker provides semantic understanding without introducing hallucinations. This combination enables high-precision task discovery that would be difficult to achieve with either traditional search or unconstrained LLM approaches alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Rationale Lexicon Extraction**: Capturing semantic relationships from existing test cases to bridge terminology gaps between users and systems. Needed because domain-specific jargon prevents lexical search from matching user intent to system modules. Quick check: Verify lexicon covers common user query patterns and system module descriptions.
- **Hybrid Pre-Filtering**: Using deterministic scoring functions to reduce candidate space before LLM processing. Needed to make LLM re-ranking computationally feasible at scale. Quick check: Measure precision@10 of pre-filter versus full candidate set.
- **Constrained LLM Re-Ranking**: Applying LLM-based semantic ranking with explicit output constraints to prevent hallucinations. Needed because unconstrained LLMs may generate unreliable or fabricated associations. Quick check: Compare hallucination rates between constrained and unconstrained approaches.
- **Enterprise Task Discovery**: Understanding how users navigate complex software systems to find relevant modules. Needed to frame the problem as semantic matching rather than simple keyword search. Quick check: Analyze query logs to identify common terminology mismatches.
- **Test Case Utilization**: Leveraging existing test artifacts as semantic knowledge sources. Needed because traditional approaches require expensive manual annotation. Quick check: Evaluate rationale lexicon quality when derived from different volumes of test cases.
- **Shortlist Constraint**: Limiting LLM re-ranking to pre-filtered candidates to ensure precision. Needed to balance computational efficiency with discovery quality. Quick check: Vary shortlist size and measure impact on Hit@5 and MRR metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Rationale Lexicon Extraction -> Hybrid Pre-Filter -> Constrained LLM Re-Rank

Critical Path: User query enters rationale lexicon extraction module, generates semantic candidates, passes through hybrid pre-filter, receives LLM re-ranking on shortlist, outputs ranked task recommendations.

Design Tradeoffs: Training-free approach trades potential fine-tuning performance for deployment flexibility and cost savings; constrained LLM limits discovery scope but ensures reliability; test case dependency assumes sufficient existing artifacts.

Failure Signatures: Poor rationale lexicon coverage leads to missed semantic matches; inadequate pre-filtering causes LLM overload and degraded performance; overly strict constraints prevent discovery of novel associations.

First Experiments:
1. Benchmark against lexical search baseline on same test set to quantify semantic improvement
2. A/B test with different shortlist sizes to optimize precision-recall tradeoff
3. Cross-domain validation on non-Head Start enterprise systems to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Performance metrics derived from small test set (80+ queries) specific to Head Start program management, limiting generalizability
- Heavy reliance on existing test cases for rationale lexicon extraction may not be feasible in all deployment scenarios
- Computational cost of LLM re-ranking at scale is not addressed, despite training-free claims
- Shortlist constraint may limit discovery of truly novel task associations beyond pre-filtered candidates

## Confidence

High confidence:
- The methodology combining rationale lexicon, hybrid pre-filter, and constrained LLM re-ranking is technically sound and addresses a real problem in enterprise search
- Performance improvement over lexical search is credible given the semantic augmentation approach

Medium confidence:
- The claim of being "training-free" requires clarification regarding model fine-tuning vs. zero-shot inference
- Scalability and computational efficiency claims need empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the system on enterprise domains beyond Head Start (e.g., healthcare administration, financial compliance) to assess cross-domain generalization of the rationale lexicon approach
2. Evaluate the impact of varying shortlist sizes on discovery performance to quantify the trade-off between computational efficiency and recall
3. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing the constrained LLM re-ranker against unconstrained approaches while measuring hallucination rates and task discovery accuracy
