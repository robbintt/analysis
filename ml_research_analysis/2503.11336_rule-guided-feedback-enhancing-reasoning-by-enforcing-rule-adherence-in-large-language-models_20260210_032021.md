# Rule-Guided Feedback: Enhancing Reasoning by Enforcing Rule Adherence in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.11336
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11336
- Reference count: 40
- Improves LLM performance by 26.5% average accuracy over direct prompting via iterative rule-constrained feedback

## Executive Summary
Rule-Guided Feedback (RGF) is a framework that enhances LLM reasoning by enforcing strict rule adherence through an iterative teacher-student feedback loop. A Teacher model evaluates Performer outputs against task-specific rules and provides constructive feedback without revealing solutions. This approach forces the Performer to engage in targeted reasoning and resolve ambiguities proactively. Evaluated across five diverse tasks, RGF consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements while maintaining computational efficiency through bounded iteration limits.

## Method Summary
RGF employs a dual-agent system where a Teacher model evaluates a Performer's outputs against predefined natural-language rules, providing feedback that explicitly cites violations without revealing solutions. The framework uses GPT-4 for both roles with temperature=0, maximum 5 iterations, and a clarifying question window (turns 1-3, threshold=0.7). For tasks where LLM-based evaluation is unreliable, external expert validators verify answers before Teacher feedback. The dialogue history maintains context through {a1, f1, a2, f2, ..., ai-1, fi-1} tracking.

## Key Results
- Achieves 26.5% average accuracy improvement over direct prompting across all tasks
- Outperforms best baseline by 7.9% on average
- Shows diminishing returns beyond 5 iterations (<1% gain with significant cost increase)
- Ablation shows 15% accuracy drop when clarifying questions are removed
- Without expert validation, Teacher evaluation accuracy drops by 8.5%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Iterative Rule-Constrained Feedback Loop
Structured feedback that references specific rule violations improves correction rates compared to generic guidance. The Teacher evaluates each output against predefined rules and provides feedback citing which rule was violated, forcing targeted reasoning rather than pattern-matching.

### Mechanism 2: Strategic Information Seeking Window
Allowing the Performer to ask clarifying questions within turns 1-3 reduces cascading errors by forcing early uncertainty resolution. This bounded window prevents indefinite stalling while ensuring ambiguities are addressed before compounding.

### Mechanism 3: Expert Validation Guardrail
External programmatic verification compensates for Teacher blind spots in domain-specific evaluation. For tasks where LLM-based evaluation is unreliable, expert functions validate answers before Teacher feedback is generated, ensuring feedback accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Teacher-Student Knowledge Distillation
  - Why needed here: RGF adapts this paradigm from model compression to inference-time guidance. Understanding that a stronger model can guide a weaker one without weight updates is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RGF differs from traditional distillation where a smaller student is fine-tuned on teacher outputs?

- Concept: Rule-Based Reasoning Systems
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on natural-language rules as evaluation criteria. Understanding how explicit constraints differ from learned implicit patterns helps interpret why adherence is hard for LLMs.
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM struggle to follow explicit rules even when they are clearly stated in the prompt?

- Concept: Iterative Refinement with Early Stopping
  - Why needed here: RGF uses a maximum-turn limit (5) and question window (turns 1-3). Understanding the trade-off between refinement depth and computational cost is essential for tuning.
  - Quick check question: What happens if you set the iteration limit too high versus too low?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task description -> Rule generation -> Performer generates answer -> Expert validator (optional) -> Teacher evaluates against rules -> Feedback generation -> Performer revises/asks clarification -> Loop

- Critical path:
  1. Task description → Rule generation (via LLM, one-time per task)
  2. Performer generates initial answer
  3. (Optional) Expert validator checks answer
  4. Teacher evaluates against rules + expert result → generates feedback
  5. If invalid and turns remain: Performer revises or asks clarification within window
  6. Loop until valid or max turns exhausted

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Iteration limit vs. cost: More iterations improve accuracy up to ~5 turns; beyond that, <1% gain with significant cost increase
  - Question window width: Too early-only misses mid-dialogue ambiguities; too late permits stalling
  - Expert validator dependency: Adds reliability but reduces generality—requires task-specific implementation

- Failure signatures:
  - Performer ignores feedback: Repeats wrong answers despite history; may require "urge prompt" to force guessing
  - Teacher misclassifies violations: Without expert validator, false positives/negatives corrupt the loop
  - Endless clarification loops: If question threshold is too permissive, Performer may stall; mitigated by turn limits

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline parity check: Run Standard Prompting and Zero-shot CoT on Checkmate and Penguins to confirm setup matches paper baselines
  2. Ablation of question window: Disable clarifying questions and measure accuracy drop; expect ~15% decrease
  3. Iteration limit sweep: Test max turns = 1, 3, 5, 7 on Checkmate to reproduce diminishing-returns curve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can a reward-based alignment mechanism improve the Performer's responsiveness to Teacher feedback compared to the current prompt-based approach?
- How does RGF perform when the Teacher and Performer are instantiated with different model families or sizes?
- What is the computational cost-performance tradeoff of RGF, and does it remain favorable for tasks requiring many iterations?

## Limitations
- Framework's effectiveness highly dependent on Teacher's ability to correctly identify rule violations without expert validation
- 0.7 threshold mechanism for clarifying questions lacks clear implementation details
- Requires task-specific expert validators for reliable performance on certain domains like poetry and chess

## Confidence

- High confidence: Iterative feedback loop mechanism (15% accuracy drop when removed) and diminishing returns beyond 5 iterations
- Medium confidence: 26.5% average accuracy improvement claim, depends heavily on task selection and expert validator quality
- Medium confidence: Strategic information seeking window's effectiveness, weak corpus support and underspecified threshold mechanism

## Next Checks
1. Implement RGF without expert validators on a subset of tasks and measure the expected 8.5% accuracy drop to validate LLM-only evaluation limitations
2. Test multiple clarifying question threshold values (0.5, 0.7, 0.9) to empirically determine optimal setting and validate 0.7 choice
3. Track answer repetition rates across turns to quantify how often the Performer ignores Teacher feedback, directly measuring acknowledged limitation
