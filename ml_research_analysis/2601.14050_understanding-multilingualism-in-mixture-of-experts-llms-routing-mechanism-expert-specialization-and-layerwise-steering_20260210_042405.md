# Understanding Multilingualism in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs: Routing Mechanism, Expert Specialization, and Layerwise Steering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14050
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14050
- Authors: Yuxin Chen; Zhengzhou Cai; Xiangtian Ji; Weixiang Zhao; An Zhang; Xiang Wang; Tat-Seng Chua
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: MoE models exhibit structured multilingual behavior with routing aligning to linguistic families, layerwise functional stratification, and steering-guided improvements (avg 1.9% gain from English on PolyMath).

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how multilingual Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs process different languages through routing mechanisms, expert specialization, and layerwise functional roles. The study reveals that MoE models implicitly organize languages by linguistic families, with high-resource languages leveraging shared experts while low-resource languages depend on exclusive experts. Layerwise interventions demonstrate that early and late layers support language-specific processing, while middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs. Based on these insights, the authors propose routing-guided steering that adaptively enhances multilingual performance by biasing middle-layer routing toward shared experts associated with dominant languages.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze multilingual processing in Qwen3-30B-A3B by computing routing frequencies per language and layer, then measure cross-language routing similarity using Jensen-Shannon divergence. They identify language-related experts (Top-K by routing frequency) and classify them as exclusive (>θ threshold) or shared. Layerwise interventions involve masking exclusive expert logits to assess functional roles. The steering method adds bias λ·W_{l,i}^{(ℓ)}·|g_{l,i}(x)| to shared-expert logits in middle layers (10-39) during inference, using dominant language statistics from MGSM to guide routing toward more effective expert pathways.

## Key Results
- Routing similarity aligns with linguistic families: Languages sharing writing systems or family origins exhibit higher routing similarity than distant languages
- Layerwise functional stratification: Early/late MoE layers support language-specific processing, while middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs
- Steering improves multilingual performance: Adaptive routing guidance yields 1.9% average accuracy gain from English and 0.7% from Chinese on PolyMath benchmark
- Resource-dependent expert utilization: High-resource languages rely on shared experts, while low-resource languages depend more on language-exclusive experts despite weaker performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Language-Family-Structured Routing
- Claim: MoE routers implicitly organize multilingual inputs according to linguistic family structure, routing related languages through overlapping expert subsets.
- Mechanism: The router learns to project language-specific hidden representations through weight matrix W^l, producing routing logits that correlate with linguistic similarity. Languages sharing writing systems or family origins develop comparable routing distributions P_l^{(ℓ)}, measured via Jensen-Shannon similarity.
- Core assumption: The routing patterns observed at inference reflect learned associations from training data distribution, not arbitrary initialization effects.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "routing aligns with linguistic families"; [Section 4.2]: "Languages from the same linguistic family or share similar writing systems tend to exhibit higher routing similarity than linguistically distant languages"

### Mechanism 2: Layerwise Functional Stratification
- Claim: MoE layers serve functionally distinct roles in multilingual processing—early/late layers handle language-specific operations while middle layers operate as language-agnostic capacity hubs.
- Mechanism: Causal intervention via expert masking reveals functional dependencies. Masking language-exclusive experts in early layers (indices 0-4) degrades comprehension; masking in late layers (indices 43-47) causes language mixing while preserving reasoning; masking middle layers (indices 22-26) has minimal impact.
- Core assumption: Masking effects are localized to the intervened layer range and do not propagate cascade failures through the network.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "early and late MoE layers support language-specific processing, whereas middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs"; [Section 6.2, Table 1]: Early-layer masking causes -31.2 accuracy drop for Bengali; late-layer masking causes -72.8 language consistency drop

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Lingual Capacity Transfer via Shared Experts
- Claim: High-resource languages achieve stronger performance by leveraging shared experts associated with dominant languages, while low-resource languages remain isolated in language-exclusive expert pathways.
- Mechanism: Dominant languages (English, Chinese) establish central routing patterns that high-resource languages access via shared experts. Low-resource languages exhibit higher routing concentration (lower entropy) and more language-exclusive experts, limiting cross-lingual transfer.
- Core assumption: Expert sharing enables knowledge transfer; isolation in exclusive experts limits access to transferable reasoning capacity.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "high-resource languages rely on shared experts while low-resource languages depend more on language-exclusive experts despite weaker performance"; [Section 5.2, Figure 3]: Low-resource languages have highest exclusive expert counts; high-resource languages have remarkably few

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Top-K Sparse Routing in MoE**
  - Why needed here: The entire analysis depends on understanding how routers select K experts from E total experts via softmax over top logits.
  - Quick check question: Given routing logits g_l(x) ∈ ℝ^E, how does the model compute the final expert output for token x?

- Concept: **Jensen-Shannon Divergence for Distribution Comparison**
  - Why needed here: Cross-language routing similarity uses JSD to quantify routing distribution overlap between language pairs.
  - Quick check question: Why use JSD instead of KL divergence when comparing routing distributions P_l^{(ℓ₁)} and P_l^{(ℓ₂)}?

- Concept: **Causal Intervention via Logit Masking**
  - Why needed here: The paper's causal claims rely on setting expert logits to large negative values (ν = -10^9) to prevent selection.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean causally if masking expert i for language ℓ degrades performance but masking it for language ℓ' does not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Router -> Linear projection W^l -> Top-K selection -> Expert activation -> Weighted sum -> Layer output
- Critical path: Router logits → Top-K selection → Expert activation → Weighted sum → Layer output. The steering method injects bias λ·W_{l,i}^{(ℓ)}·|g_{l,i}(x)| into middle-layer logits only.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Threshold θ=0.4 for exclusive expert classification: Higher θ yields fewer exclusive experts, potentially missing language-specific specialists
  - Steering coefficient λ ≈ 0.022: Too weak (< 0.01) has no effect; too strong (> 0.026) collapses performance
  - Layer window selection: Intervening on 5 layers (early: 0-4, middle: 22-26, late: 43-47) standardizes comparison but may miss boundary effects
- Failure signatures:
  - Early-layer steering: Reasoning degradation, query misunderstanding
  - Late-layer steering: Severe language mixing (e.g., French outputs switching to English mid-sentence)
  - Excessive λ: Sharp accuracy collapse across all target languages
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate routing similarity matrix (Figure 1) for your target language set using BELEBELE; verify block-wise family structure emerges
  2. Run layerwise intervention on one high-resource and one low-resource language; confirm early/late masking effects differ from middle
  3. Apply steering with English source to a Latin-script language (e.g., Spanish) and a non-Latin language (e.g., Japanese); compare gain magnitudes to validate linguistic proximity hypothesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study's causal claims rely on heuristic interventions (logit masking) that may have unintended side effects beyond the targeted expert suppression
- The exclusive expert classification threshold (θ=0.4 for analysis, θ=0.7 for steering) appears arbitrary and could significantly impact observed patterns
- The steering method assumes fixed routing statistics from MGSM will generalize across tasks, but this relationship may not hold for domains with different linguistic distributions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Routing aligns with linguistic families (supported by JSD analysis across 10 languages); Layerwise functional stratification (confirmed by systematic intervention experiments showing distinct early/late vs middle layer effects)
- **Medium Confidence**: Expert specialization patterns (exclusive vs shared expert distributions depend on arbitrary thresholds); Steering method effectiveness (task-specific gains observed but generalization unclear)
- **Low Confidence**: Causal interpretation of interventions (masking may trigger compensation mechanisms); Resource-level generalization (10-language sample may not represent broader linguistic diversity)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate routing similarity analysis with expanded language set (including Uralic, Dravidian, and sign languages) to test whether linguistic family clustering holds beyond Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan families
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the exclusive expert threshold θ∈[0.3, 0.6] to determine robustness of observed U-shaped distribution patterns
3. Test steering transferability by pretraining routing statistics on MGSM but evaluating on completely different multilingual tasks (e.g., machine translation, code-switching detection)
