# Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts

## Quick Facts

- This paper proposes using diffusion models to generate future candlestick chart images from current charts and technical indicator prompts, treating time-series financial data as visual patterns.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using diffusion models for generative forecasting of financial candlestick charts, treating time-series data as visual patterns. The authors fine-tune Stable Diffusion 1.5 to predict next-candle charts based on input images and instruction prompts containing RSI and MACD values. Experiments on Bitcoin futures data yield an overall accuracy of 68.89%, with the majority class achieving F1-score of 81.59% while minority classes perform poorly due to imbalance and model limitations. Qualitative results show the model captures chart patterns including volume and moving averages, demonstrating feasibility but highlighting room for improvement through better evaluation metrics, larger datasets, and multimodal integration.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tune Stable Diffusion 1.5 to generate future candlestick chart images from current charts with technical indicator prompts. They construct paired datasets of current and future charts with evaluation markers (red for >2% gain, blue for >2% loss, black otherwise) and introduce an RGB-based classification method to evaluate generated images. The model takes current chart images and text prompts containing RSI and MACD values as input to generate predicted next-candle charts.

## Key Results
- Overall accuracy of 68.89% on Bitcoin futures forecasting
- Majority class (black) achieves F1-score of 81.59%
- Minority classes (blue, red) perform poorly due to class imbalance and model limitations
- Model successfully captures chart patterns including volume and moving averages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Diffusion models excel at generating complex visual patterns and can learn the statistical relationships between current chart configurations and their future states. By fine-tuning on financial chart data, the model learns to map visual patterns of technical indicators and price action to likely future outcomes. The generative approach captures multi-modal possibilities rather than deterministic predictions, providing a distribution over potential future charts that can be sampled.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion model training mechanics**: Understanding the forward noising process and reverse denoising process is essential for adapting the architecture to chart generation
  - Why needed: The model must learn to denoise chart images conditioned on current states and technical indicators
  - Quick check: Verify that the reverse process converges and generates plausible chart structures

- **Image-based financial data representation**: Converting time-series financial data into candlestick chart images preserves visual patterns while losing some temporal granularity
  - Why needed: Enables use of powerful vision-based generative models on financial data
  - Quick check: Ensure candlestick patterns are accurately represented in generated images

- **RGB-based classification for evaluation**: Using color-coded evaluation markers (red/blue/black) enables automated assessment of generated forecast quality
  - Why needed: Provides objective metric for comparing generated forecasts against ground truth
  - Quick check: Validate classification accuracy on known chart images

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Current Chart Image -> Stable Diffusion 1.5 Fine-tuned Model -> Generated Future Chart Image

**Critical path**: Input chart image + technical indicator text prompt → Cross-attention layers → Denoising UNet → Output generated chart image → RGB classification → Performance metrics

**Design tradeoffs**: The authors chose Stable Diffusion 1.5 for its strong generation capabilities and open availability, trading off model size and training efficiency against the need for fine-tuning on financial-specific data. The decision to use text prompts for technical indicators rather than direct integration represents a simpler implementation at the cost of potentially weaker conditioning.

**Failure signatures**: Poor minority class performance indicates the model struggles with rare market movements; unrealistic chart patterns suggest insufficient training data or poor prompt conditioning; artifacts in generated images may indicate overfitting to specific chart configurations.

**First experiments**:
1. Test generation quality on held-out current charts with known future outcomes
2. Evaluate RGB classification accuracy on ground truth charts to establish baseline
3. Perform ablation study comparing text-prompt versus direct technical indicator integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The image-based representation loses temporal dependencies and high-frequency price movements critical for accurate forecasting
- Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's natural image priors and structured financial visualizations
- The binary classification of continuous price movements oversimplifies the forecasting problem and may not capture nuanced probability distributions

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical feasibility of fine-tuning diffusion models for chart generation is demonstrated, and the qualitative assessment of pattern preservation (volume, moving averages) is reliable

**Medium confidence**: The quantitative evaluation metrics (68.89% overall accuracy, F1-scores) are methodologically sound but may not fully capture practical forecasting utility

**Low confidence**: The model's ability to generalize beyond the training period and handle extreme market conditions remains unverified

## Next Checks

1. Implement temporal cross-validation across multiple market regimes (bull, bear, sideways) to assess robustness to regime changes
2. Compare generated forecasts against multiple technical indicator-based baselines using financial-specific metrics (Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown) rather than simple classification accuracy
3. Conduct ablation studies removing technical indicator prompts versus integrating them as additional input channels to quantify their actual contribution to forecast quality
