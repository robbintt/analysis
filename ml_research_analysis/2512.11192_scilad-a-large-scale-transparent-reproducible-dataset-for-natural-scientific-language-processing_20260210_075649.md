# SciLaD: A Large-Scale, Transparent, Reproducible Dataset for Natural Scientific Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11192
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11192
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 35M+ multilingual scientific publications in reproducible TEI XML pipeline, RoBERTa model matches SciBERT on NER, PICO, DEP, REL, CLS benchmarks

## Executive Summary
SciLaD introduces a large-scale, transparent, and reproducible dataset of scientific publications built entirely from open-source tools and open-access sources. The dataset comprises over 35 million multilingual publications in TEI XML and a filtered English split of 10 million documents, enabling high-quality scientific language modeling. A RoBERTa-base model pre-trained on SciLaD achieves competitive results across scientific NLP benchmarks (NER, PICO, DEP, REL, CLS), matching or exceeding established models like SciBERT. The extensible pipeline supports reproducible data construction and evaluation, advancing accessible and ethical scientific language research.

## Method Summary
The dataset is constructed from open-access sources using a reproducible pipeline built with open-source tools. Publications are processed into TEI XML format, then filtered for English-language content to create a clean text split. The pipeline includes robust text extraction from structured XML, quality filtering, and systematic preprocessing. A RoBERTa-base model is pre-trained on this corpus and evaluated across multiple scientific NLP tasks including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and document classification. The approach emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, and ethical data sourcing.

## Key Results
- 35M+ multilingual publications in TEI XML format with reproducible pipeline
- Filtered English split of 10M documents used for RoBERTa-base pre-training
- Model performance matches or exceeds SciBERT across NER, PICO, DEP, REL, CLS benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SciLaD's effectiveness stems from its combination of scale, transparency, and reproducibility. By using only open-access sources and open-source tools, the dataset avoids proprietary bottlenecks while maintaining quality. The TEI XML format provides structured, machine-readable scientific content that preserves semantic relationships. The English filtering ensures high-quality input for language modeling while the full XML corpus supports future multilingual expansion. The reproducible pipeline enables independent verification and extension by the research community.

## Foundational Learning
- **TEI XML format**: Why needed - preserves semantic structure of scientific documents; Quick check - verify XML parsing produces coherent text blocks
- **Open-access corpus construction**: Why needed - ensures legal redistribution and transparency; Quick check - confirm license metadata is properly extracted
- **Scientific domain adaptation**: Why needed - generic models underperform on specialized scientific language; Quick check - compare performance on domain-specific vs general benchmarks
- **Reproducible pipeline methodology**: Why needed - enables independent verification and community adoption; Quick check - rerun the entire pipeline from raw sources
- **Multilingual scientific text processing**: Why needed - scientific discourse spans multiple languages; Quick check - validate language detection accuracy across non-English samples
- **Ethical data sourcing**: Why needed - prevents copyright violations and supports open science; Quick check - verify all sources have appropriate open licenses

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Open-access sources -> TEI XML extraction -> Text cleaning -> Language filtering -> Pre-training corpus -> RoBERTa model -> Benchmark evaluation

**Critical Path**: Source acquisition → XML parsing → Quality filtering → Language detection → Model training → Task-specific fine-tuning → Benchmark evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Text-only conversion excludes equations and tables for quality, sacrificing some semantic completeness for cleaner input; English filtering improves model quality but limits multilingual coverage; open-source tooling ensures reproducibility but may limit optimization compared to proprietary solutions

**Failure Signatures**: Poor XML parsing leads to fragmented text; incorrect language detection includes non-English content; inadequate quality filtering introduces noise; license issues prevent legal redistribution; benchmark misalignment invalidates performance comparisons

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify TEI XML parsing produces coherent scientific text from sample documents
2. Test language detection accuracy on mixed-language scientific corpus
3. Evaluate model performance on a single benchmark task before full evaluation suite

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SciLaD-based model performance compare when training sequence-to-sequence or decoder-only architectures for generative scientific tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Our current experiments focus on discriminative tasks such as classification, relation extraction, and named entity recognition. However, the dataset also holds potential for generative model development. As part of our ongoing work, we plan to train sequence-to-sequence and decoder-only language models... to explore the dataset's applicability for summarization, text generation, and scientific question answering."
- Why unresolved: Only encoder-based RoBERTa models were evaluated; generative architectures remain untested despite the evaluation pipeline supporting them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results from T5, mBART, or decoder-only models trained on SciLaD across summarization, generation, and QA tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What proportion of the dataset can be legally redistributed under CC-BY or similar permissive licenses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In future iterations, we aim to provide a clearly defined CC-BY data split that ensures unrestricted use and redistribution... From our study, it also emerges that reusable content accounts for 32.4% of the harvested OA documents."
- Why unresolved: Only 32.4% identified as reusable; 54% have unidentified licenses, creating legal uncertainty for redistribution.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive license audit of the full corpus with per-sample license metadata and a filtered CC-BY redistributable subset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the decision to exclude equations and table bodies from the plain text conversion significantly impact performance on quantitative reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors state "formulas, equations, and table bodies were excluded" because quality extraction was "challenging to assess." This creates a potential blind spot for tasks requiring mathematical or tabular reasoning.
- Why unresolved: No evaluation was conducted on tasks requiring formula understanding or table comprehension; the tradeoff between text quality and semantic completeness remains unquantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation on scientific benchmarks requiring mathematical reasoning (e.g., math word problems, table-to-text generation) between models trained with and without formula/table content.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does multilingual scientific NLP performance vary when using the unfiltered 35M document TEI XML split compared to the English-only filtered split?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "the plain text clean split in this study is limited to English, and expanding it to include other languages would enhance its applicability across diverse linguistic contexts."
- Why unresolved: Only English documents were filtered and used for model training; the multilingual TEI XML split (35M documents including Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish) remains unevaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-lingual transfer benchmarks or multilingual model performance comparing English-only versus multilingual training data.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused primarily on biomedical benchmarks, leaving uncertainty about performance on non-biomedical scientific domains
- English-only filtered split may not fully represent global scientific discourse despite multilingual XML availability
- No explicit bias analysis for representation across geography, discipline, or publication venue

## Confidence
- **High**: Dataset scale claims, reproducible pipeline methodology, pre-training results matching established benchmarks
- **Medium**: Cross-domain generalization potential, bias mitigation effectiveness, practical adoption of TEI XML format
- **Low**: Not applicable - no low-confidence claims identified

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SciLaD-pretrained models on non-biomedical scientific benchmarks (e.g., computer science, social sciences) to assess domain generalization
2. Conduct a bias audit across publication country, discipline, and venue to quantify representation gaps in the corpus
3. Benchmark the TEI XML preprocessing pipeline against alternative XML/HTML extraction tools to confirm robustness and efficiency
