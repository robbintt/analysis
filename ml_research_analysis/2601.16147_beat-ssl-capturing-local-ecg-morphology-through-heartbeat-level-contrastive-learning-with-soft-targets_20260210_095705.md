# Beat-ssl: Capturing Local ECG Morphology through Heartbeat-level Contrastive Learning with Soft Targets
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.16147
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16147
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Key result:** Achieved 93% of foundation model performance using 31.8× less data

## Executive Summary
Beat-SSL introduces a novel contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis that captures both global rhythm-level and local heartbeat-level contexts using soft targets derived from feature similarity. The method addresses limited labeled ECG data by leveraging self-supervised pretraining with physiologically-inspired augmentations in the VCG domain. By employing dual-level contrasting with soft similarity targets ranging from 0 to 1, Beat-SSL better captures continuous feature relationships compared to binary labels. The approach demonstrates superior performance on both multilabel classification and ECG segmentation tasks.

## Method Summary
Beat-SSL employs a dual-level contrastive learning framework that operates at both global and local contexts of ECG signals. The method transforms ECG signals into the Vectorcardiogram (VCG) domain and applies physiologically-inspired augmentations such as temporal scaling, amplitude perturbation, and morphological transformations. Unlike traditional contrastive learning that uses binary positive/negative labels, Beat-SSL uses soft targets ranging from 0 to 1 based on feature similarity, allowing for more nuanced representation learning. The framework pretrains on unlabeled ECG data and then fine-tunes on downstream tasks including multilabel classification and segmentation, demonstrating effective transfer learning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieved 93% of foundation model performance on multilabel classification using 31.8× less training data
- Outperformed all baseline methods by 4% on ECG segmentation tasks
- Demonstrated effective transfer learning from self-supervised pretraining to both global rhythm assessment and precise local morphology analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Beat-SSL works by capturing richer feature relationships through soft similarity targets rather than binary labels. The continuous range from 0 to 1 better represents the natural variability in ECG morphology and rhythm patterns. The dual-level contrasting mechanism simultaneously learns global rhythm patterns and local heartbeat morphologies, creating representations that are useful for both classification and segmentation tasks. The VCG domain augmentations provide physiologically meaningful transformations that preserve the underlying cardiac structure while introducing variability needed for robust representation learning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning:** Why needed: Enables representation learning from unlabeled data by pulling similar examples together and pushing dissimilar examples apart. Quick check: Are positive pairs truly similar and negative pairs truly dissimilar?
- **Vectorcardiogram (VCG) Domain:** Why needed: Provides 3D representation of cardiac electrical activity that captures spatial relationships better than 1D ECG. Quick check: Does VCG transformation preserve essential diagnostic features?
- **Soft Targets vs Binary Labels:** Why needed: Continuous similarity scores better capture the natural variability in ECG morphology compared to hard binary decisions. Quick check: Is the soft target formulation statistically superior to binary alternatives?
- **Self-supervised Pretraining:** Why needed: Leverages large amounts of unlabeled ECG data to create foundation representations before fine-tuning on limited labeled data. Quick check: Does pretraining significantly improve downstream task performance?
- **Physiological Augmentations:** Why needed: Domain-specific transformations that maintain medical validity while providing training diversity. Quick check: Are augmentations realistic and clinically meaningful?
- **Dual-level Contrasting:** Why needed: Simultaneously captures both global rhythm patterns and local heartbeat morphologies for comprehensive representation learning. Quick check: Does dual-level learning improve over single-level approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** ECG signal -> VCG transformation -> Augmentations -> Encoder network -> Feature embeddings -> Dual-level contrasting (global + local) -> Soft similarity targets -> Loss function
- **Critical Path:** The core innovation flows through the soft target computation and dual-level contrasting mechanism, which directly influences the learned representations used for downstream tasks.
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Soft targets provide richer supervision but increase computational complexity compared to binary labels. The VCG domain offers better spatial representation but requires additional transformation computation.
- **Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may result from inappropriate threshold selection for soft targets, inadequate augmentation diversity, or insufficient pretraining duration.
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Compare soft target performance against binary labels on a simple classification task
  2. Ablate the dual-level contrasting to test individual contributions of global vs local contexts
  3. Test different VCG transformation parameters to optimize feature preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only two datasets (PTB-XL and LUDB), raising questions about generalization to other clinical settings
- Lack of ablation studies comparing different augmentation strategies, particularly the effectiveness of VCG domain augmentations
- No quantification of computational overhead for the dual-level contrasting mechanism
- Absence of cross-dataset validation to assess domain shift robustness

## Confidence
- **High:** 93% performance relative to larger models, 4% segmentation improvement
- **Medium:** Broader claim that soft targets are superior to hard binary labels (methodological assumption)
- **Low:** Claim about VCG domain augmentation effectiveness (no ablation studies provided)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing soft targets against hard binary labels and other similarity weighting schemes to isolate the contribution of the soft target approach
2. Perform cross-dataset evaluation on at least three additional ECG databases to assess generalization capability
3. Analyze computational complexity including training time, memory usage, and inference latency compared to standard contrastive learning baselines
