# BlueGlass: A Framework for Composite AI Safety

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10106
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10106
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Framework enabling composition of diverse safety tools shows phase transitions in VLMs, spurious correlations via SAEs, and 14.2 AP (open-vocab) vs 58.3 AP (fine-tuned) for grounding DINO.

## Executive Summary
BLUE GLASS is a framework designed to integrate heterogeneous AI safety tools into unified workflows for vision-language models. It addresses the fundamental challenge that no single tool can provide comprehensive safety assurance by enabling composition of behavioral evaluators, mechanistic probes, and interpretability methods. The framework was validated through three analyses: distributional evaluation revealing performance trade-offs across datasets, probe-based analysis showing shared hierarchical learning principles via phase transitions, and sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts and spurious correlations. Results demonstrate the framework's capability to uncover safety-relevant insights while providing infrastructure for future composite safety workflows.

## Method Summary
BLUE GLASS provides standardized abstractions (Interceptor, Recorder, Patcher, Aligner) that normalize model internals into Apache Arrow/Parquet schemas, enabling diverse safety tools to operate on the same data. The framework was applied to vision-language models for object detection using three complementary approaches: distributional evaluation comparing grounding vs fine-tuned DINO across multiple datasets, linear approximation probes trained on decoder layer features to study hierarchical feature learning, and TopK sparse autoencoders to decompose representations into interpretable sparse units. Evaluation used Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) metrics, with VLM outputs mapped to dataset labels via text encoders and cosine similarity.

## Key Results
- Grounding DINO achieved 14.2 AP on open-vocabulary detection while fine-tuned DINO reached 58.3 AP on EuroCity Persons.
- Phase transitions observed universally across VLMs and vision-only detectors, indicating similar hierarchical feature learning mechanisms.
- SAE analysis uncovered concepts like animal recognition and spurious correlations with hands predicting knives or phones.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Unified Infrastructure Enables Tool Composition
Composing multiple safety tools provides more comprehensive assurance than any single tool in isolation. The framework's standardized abstractions normalize heterogeneous model internals into a common schema, enabling diverse tools to operate on the same data without per-model instrumentation. This addresses the complementary blind spots of behavioral, mechanistic, and distributional tools.

### Mechanism 2: Approximation Probes Reveal Phase Transitions in Layer Dynamics
Linear probes trained to approximate model predictions show a phase transition - a sharp reorganization - across decoder layers, indicating shared hierarchical feature learning across VLMs and vision-only detectors. This dip-then-surge trajectory suggests early layers extract generic features, middle layers reorganize, and late layers refine task-specific abstractions.

### Mechanism 3: Sparse Autoencoders Expose Spurious Correlations
SAEs decompose polysemantic representations into interpretable sparse units, revealing both meaningful concepts and spurious correlations (e.g., hands → knives/phones). TopK SAEs enforce sparsity in higher-dimensional latent space, with dataset attribution identifying maximally activating inputs per sparse unit for human interpretation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Linear Representation Hypothesis**: Why needed here: Approximation probes assume task-relevant information becomes linearly separable with depth; understanding this justifies probe-based analysis. Quick check: Can a linear classifier trained on layer ℓ's activations predict the task output accurately? If yes, information is linearly accessible.

- **Information Bottleneck Principle**: Why needed here: Explains why phase transitions occur - layers trade off compression vs preservation. Quick check: Does mutual information I(Zℓ; X) decrease while I(Zℓ; Y) increases or stabilizes across layers?

- **Polysemanticity and Sparse Coding**: Why needed here: SAEs address the problem that single neurons encode multiple concepts; sparsity forces disentanglement. Quick check: Do SAE latent units fire selectively for coherent input patterns, or do multiple unrelated inputs activate the same unit?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Model wrappers (HuggingFace, detectron2, mmdetection) -> Interceptor (access points) -> Recorder (capture) -> Aligner (standardize) -> Storage (Arrow/Parquet) -> Safety Tools (Probes, SAEs, Evaluators)

- **Critical path**: 1) Wrap target model with Interceptor; define access points. 2) Run Recorder to extract activations; pass through Aligner to standardized schema. 3) Store features via FeatureDataset; train probes or SAEs; run evaluation pipelines.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Hooked vs manual mode (automation vs flexibility); TopK vs ReLU SAEs (stricter sparsity control vs simplicity); streaming vs cached features (footprint vs speed).

- **Failure signatures**: Probes show flat accuracy → wrong access points; SAE reconstruction loss plateaus → expansion factor too low; evaluation yields ungrounded predictions → negative classes/part prompts missing.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate Interceptor: Extract decoder layer 4 features from Grounding DINO; verify schema. 2) Probe baseline: Train classification/localization probes on each decoder layer; plot AP vs layer index. 3) SAE sanity check: Train TopK SAE on layer 4 features; visualize top-activating patches for 5 random units.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can SAE-identified spurious correlations (e.g., "hand" → "knife") be systematically repaired using activation patching without degrading general detection capabilities? The paper identifies features but doesn't validate safe suppression or correction.

- **Open Question 2**: How can evaluation pipelines be adapted to robustly assess generative VLMs (LLaVA, GPT-4o) that produce unparsable outputs? Current text-mapping pipeline failed for several state-of-the-art models.

- **Open Question 3**: Does the phase transition phenomenon shift to later layers as semantic complexity or label set size increases in open-vocabulary settings? Analysis suggests dependency on label complexity but hasn't mapped this relationship.

## Limitations
- Core mechanism linking probe-based phase transitions to shared learning principles remains low confidence due to lack of corpus validation for VLMs.
- SAE-based interpretability claims carry medium confidence as monosemanticity assumption lacks empirical validation.
- Framework demonstrates individual tools rather than validating composition provides more comprehensive safety assurance.

## Confidence
- Probe-based phase transitions: Low confidence (no corpus validation for VLMs)
- SAE interpretability: Medium confidence (monosemanticity not quantified)
- Tool composition efficacy: Low confidence (individual tools demonstrated, not systematic comparison)

## Next Checks
1. **Phase Transition Verification**: Run probe analysis on multiple VLM architectures (Grounding DINO, BLIP-2, Flamingo) to confirm universal pattern across diverse model families.
2. **SAE Monosemanticity Test**: Quantitatively assess SAE feature interpretability through human annotator agreement and compare reconstruction quality against alternative sparse coding methods.
3. **Composition Efficacy Benchmark**: Design controlled experiments comparing individual tools versus composed framework on same safety task to measure statistical improvements in detection coverage.
