# ScheduleMe: Multi-Agent Calendar Assistant
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25693
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25693
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Multi-agent system achieves 65-100% task success across six languages with high usability scores

## Executive Summary
ScheduleMe is a multi-agent calendar assistant that leverages large language models to manage Google Calendar events through natural language interactions. The system employs a graph-structured coordination mechanism where a central supervisory agent delegates tasks to specialized agents for scheduling, editing, deletion, and availability checking. Using LangGraph for coordination and ReAct reasoning for task execution, the system demonstrates strong multilingual capabilities and high user satisfaction in evaluations.

## Method Summary
The system uses a multi-agent architecture with a central supervisory agent coordinating specialized sub-agents through LangGraph. Each agent employs ReAct reasoning to invoke Google Calendar API tools. The architecture supports zero-shot multilingual operation across six languages, with agents dynamically interpreting natural language requests and executing appropriate calendar operations. The system processes user inputs through a pipeline that includes intent recognition, task decomposition, and API tool invocation for calendar management.

## Key Results
- Task success rates across six languages: 65-100% per language
- Highest performance in English and European languages
- User study (n=20) shows SUS score of 82.5, trust rating of 4.3/5, and satisfaction rating of 4.6/5
- Zero-shot multilingual evaluation demonstrates system's ability to handle diverse language inputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its modular multi-agent architecture that decomposes complex calendar management tasks into specialized sub-tasks handled by dedicated agents. The LangGraph coordination framework enables dynamic task routing and context preservation across agent interactions. ReAct reasoning provides a structured approach to tool invocation and decision-making, while the API integration layer ensures reliable execution of calendar operations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Needed to handle complex, multi-step calendar tasks that require different expertise areas. Quick check: Can the system successfully route a complex scheduling request through multiple specialized agents?
- **ReAct reasoning**: Required for structured decision-making and tool invocation in dynamic environments. Quick check: Does the agent correctly choose between API tools based on task requirements?
- **Zero-shot multilingual processing**: Essential for handling diverse user inputs without language-specific training. Quick check: Can the system understand and execute tasks in all six tested languages?
- **LangGraph framework**: Provides the coordination infrastructure for agent communication and state management. Quick check: Is task state properly maintained across agent handoffs?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Input -> Supervisory Agent -> Specialized Agents (Scheduling, Editing, Deletion, Availability) -> Google Calendar API
- **Critical path**: Natural language input → Intent recognition → Task decomposition → Agent selection → Tool invocation → API execution → Response generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Multi-agent specialization vs. complexity, zero-shot learning vs. performance optimization, dynamic coordination vs. deterministic flow
- **Failure signatures**: Task decomposition errors, agent misrouting, API invocation failures, context loss during agent handoffs
- **First experiments**: 1) Test basic scheduling task end-to-end, 2) Validate multilingual task understanding, 3) Measure response time for complex multi-agent operations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance varies significantly across languages (65-100% success), with Asian languages showing notably lower success rates
- User study sample size limited to 20 participants without demographic diversity reporting
- Lack of comparative analysis against existing calendar assistants or ablation studies of the multi-agent approach

## Confidence
- High confidence in core functionality and API integration capabilities
- Medium confidence in multilingual performance claims due to limited language coverage and unexplained performance gaps
- Medium confidence in usability metrics given small sample size and lack of demographic details
- Low confidence in claims about dynamic execution advantages without comparative validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale user studies (n>100) with diverse demographics and task complexity levels to validate usability claims across different user populations
2. Perform head-to-head comparisons against existing calendar assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa) using standardized task sets to quantify the multi-agent approach benefits
3. Implement systematic ablation testing comparing the full multi-agent system against single-agent variants to measure the value of specialized agent coordination
