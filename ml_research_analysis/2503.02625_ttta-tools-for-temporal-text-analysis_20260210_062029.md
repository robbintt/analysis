# ttta: Tools for Temporal Text Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02625
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02625
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Unified framework for analyzing language evolution through diachronic embeddings, dynamic topic modeling, and document scaling

## Executive Summary
The ttta package provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing temporal text data by consolidating multiple temporal analysis tools into a single accessible platform. It addresses the fragmentation of existing approaches by offering diachronic embeddings for tracking word meaning changes, dynamic topic modeling through RollingLDA and LDAPrototype for detecting emerging topics, and document scaling via Poisson Reduced Rank models for analyzing entity positioning in latent spaces. The package enables researchers to identify rapid topic changes and interpret narrative shifts, as demonstrated in German Bundestag speeches where the Topical Changes model detected key shifts in political discourse.

## Method Summary
The package implements three main temporal analysis approaches: RollingLDA uses a rolling window approach with LDAPrototype initialization to estimate topics over time while tracking rapid changes; Topical Changes model applies monitoring procedures to detect statistically significant shifts in topic-word associations; and diachronic embeddings employ either static Word2Vec with rotation matrix alignment or BERT-based contextual sense tracking to reveal semantic trajectory shifts. The package requires time-chunked text data with timestamps and document IDs, and provides tools for visualizing topic stability, change points, and semantic trajectories.

## Key Results
- RollingLDA enables topic estimation over time with improved sensitivity to rapid changes compared to other dynamic topic models
- Topical Changes model successfully detected key shifts in German Bundestag political discourse
- Diachronic embeddings revealed semantic trajectory shifts, showing "ukraine" evolving from associations with Russia and China to alignment with Europe and eventually war contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
RollingLDA processes temporally-ordered documents in overlapping chunks using a rolling window approach, with LDAPrototype providing consistent initialization from the previous window's topic distribution. This enables tracking even rapid changes that other dynamic topic models struggle with, under the assumption that adjacent time periods share sufficient lexical overlap for coherent topic transfer.

### Mechanism 2
Topical Changes model monitors stability of topic-word distributions from RollingLDA outputs, flagging change points when observed stability falls below a threshold. This detects statistically significant shifts in word-topic associations over time, assuming meaningful semantic shifts manifest as measurable instability in topic-word distributions.

### Mechanism 3
Diachronic embeddings train Word2Vec on each time chunk then align spaces via orthogonal rotation matrices, or use BERT to associate word usage with senses per sentence. This reveals semantic trajectory shifts by capturing embedding neighborhood structure that encodes meaningful semantic relationships which shift when word usage changes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) fundamentals**: Why needed here - RollingLDA extends LDA; without understanding topic-word-document distributions, you cannot interpret outputs or diagnose failures. Quick check: Can you explain why a document is represented as a mixture of topics, and a topic as a distribution over words?

- **Word embedding geometry and alignment**: Why needed here - Diachronic embeddings rely on rotation-based alignment; misalignment produces spurious semantic shift signals. Quick check: Why must alignment use orthogonal rotation rather than arbitrary linear transformation when comparing embedding spaces?

- **Time series change point detection principles**: Why needed here - Topical Changes model applies monitoring procedures to stability metrics. Quick check: What is the tradeoff between sensitivity (detecting real changes) and specificity (avoiding false alarms) in threshold-based detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Temporal corpus preparation → time chunking → RollingLDA (time-ordered corpus → LDAPrototype initialization → rolling window topic inference) → Topical Changes (RollingLDA outputs → stability computation → threshold monitoring) → Diachronic Embeddings (time-chunked corpus → per-chunk embedding training → cross-chunk alignment) → Document Scaling (entity-labeled corpus → Poisson Reduced Rank model)

- **Critical path**: Temporal corpus preparation (timestamp + document ID required) → time chunking strategy → model selection (RollingLDA vs. embeddings vs. scaling) → output interpretation. RollingLDA is the central dependency for Topical Changes.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Window size - smaller windows capture rapid change but risk sparsity; larger windows smooth noise but may miss abrupt shifts. Embedding type - static embeddings (Word2Vec) are faster but polysemous; BERT-based senses handle polysemy but require more compute.

- **Failure signatures**: Topics appear incoherent across windows → check window size and vocabulary filtering. Change points everywhere or nowhere → recalibrate stability threshold. Embedding trajectories are chaotic → reduce dimensionality noise or increase per-chunk corpus size.

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Apply RollingLDA to a small, well-understood temporal corpus (e.g., news headlines over 6 months) with known events; verify topics align with expected themes. 2) Run Topical Changes detection and manually inspect flagged change points against external event timeline; assess precision/recall informally. 3) Generate diachronic embeddings for a high-frequency word with known semantic shift (e.g., "cloud", "stream"); compare trajectory to linguistic intuition.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How reliably can Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret detected topic changes compared to human expert analysis?**: The authors propose using LLMs to interpret changes and relate them to possible narrative shifts, but lack validation metrics comparing LLM interpretations to gold-standard human semantic judgments.

- **How sensitive is the Topical Changes detection algorithm to the selection of the rolling window size?**: The paper highlights that RollingLDA uses a "rolling window approach" but does not analyze how window width affects the granularity or stability of detected change points.

- **Do the two included diachronic embedding methods (alignment-based vs. contextual) converge on similar semantic shift trajectories?**: The package offers two distinct embedding approaches but does not specify if these methods produce consistent results when applied to the same data.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation to single case study (German Bundestag speeches)
- No quantitative performance metrics or comparison to state-of-the-art baselines
- Effectiveness of RollingLDA versus established dynamic topic models is asserted but not benchmarked

## Confidence
- **High**: The package architecture is internally coherent; RollingLDA builds logically on LDA, and diachronic embeddings follow established methodology.
- **Medium**: Claims about detecting rapid topic changes and semantic shifts are plausible but under-validated.
- **Low**: No experimental evidence for document scaling via Poisson Reduced Rank models; this component is described but not demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark RollingLDA**: Compare topic coherence and change detection sensitivity against Dynamic Topic Models and Topics over Time on a temporal corpus with known events.
2. **Evaluate change detection**: Apply Topical Changes model to synthetic data with injected change points at known timestamps; measure precision, recall, and F1 score across different threshold settings.
3. **Test diachronic embeddings**: Validate embedding alignment quality using parallel corpora across time periods; measure nearest-neighbor consistency and semantic drift alignment with external linguistic data.
