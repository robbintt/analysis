# Graph-Based Complexity Metrics for Multi-Agent Curriculum Learning: A Validated Approach to Task Ordering in Cooperative Coordination Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07074
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07074
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Graph-based complexity metric achieves ρ = 0.952 correlation with empirical difficulty, enabling 56× performance improvement in multi-agent coordination tasks

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a graph-based complexity metric for multi-agent curriculum learning that addresses the fundamental challenge of task sequencing in cooperative coordination environments. The proposed metric integrates agent dependency entropy, spatial interference patterns, and goal overlap analysis to predict task difficulty, validated through strong empirical correlation with random-agent performance. The curriculum learning framework demonstrates substantial performance improvements in tight coordination scenarios, establishing systematic progression principles for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The approach moves beyond arbitrary parameter ordering to provide a principled method for curriculum design in multi-agent systems.

## Method Summary
The approach constructs agent dependency graphs from trajectory data using spatial proximity thresholds (θ = 0.5) to capture coordination patterns. Task difficulty is computed through coordination entropy (measuring interaction unpredictability), spatial interference (minimum pairwise distances), and goal overlap (cooperation ratio). These components are combined with weights [0.4, 0.3, 0.3] to generate complexity scores that order curriculum tasks. The framework uses MADDPG with centralized training and decentralized execution, where agents progress through tasks upon achieving success rates > 0.6 or reaching 300-episode timeouts. The metric is validated against random-agent performance on 15 varied tasks before curriculum training begins.

## Key Results
- Strong empirical validation with ρ = 0.952 correlation between predicted complexity and empirical difficulty
- Up to 56× performance improvement in tight coordination scenarios (MultiWalker environment)
- Systematic task progression demonstrated in cooperative navigation (Simple Spread)
- Coordination tightness identified as key predictor of curriculum learning effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Agent dependency graphs capture coordination structure that predicts task difficulty.
- Mechanism: The system constructs a graph G = (V, E) where vertices represent agents and edges capture coordination dependencies based on spatial proximity (threshold θ = 0.5) and interaction frequency over trajectories. This representation converts unstructured multi-agent dynamics into a measurable graph structure.
- Core assumption: Spatial proximity during task execution correlates with coordination dependency strength.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "constructs agent dependency graphs capturing coordination patterns and computes task difficulty using coordination entropy, spatial interference, and goal overlap measures"
  - [section III.A.1]: "pairwise interaction frequencies are computed as Dij(t) = 1 if ||pi(t) - pj(t)||2 < θ"
  - [corpus]: Related work on graph neural networks for multi-robot path planning (Li et al., IROS 2020) supports graph representations for coordination, though curriculum applications remain underexplored.
- Break condition: If agents coordinate without proximity (e.g., communication-based coordination) or interfere without coordination dependency, the graph structure may misrepresent true difficulty.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Coordination entropy quantifies interaction unpredictability, predicting learning complexity.
- Mechanism: Graph entropy H(G) = -Σ p(e)log₂p(e) measures the diversity and distribution of coordination patterns. High entropy indicates varied, unpredictable interactions requiring sophisticated policies; low entropy suggests simpler, repetitive coordination.
- Core assumption: Interaction pattern diversity directly correlates with policy learning difficulty.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "computes task difficulty using coordination entropy"
  - [section III.A.2]: "High entropy indicates complex, varied interaction patterns requiring sophisticated coordination strategies"
  - [corpus]: Weak direct evidence—corpus papers focus on coordination mechanisms rather than entropy-based complexity metrics.
- Break condition: If simple tasks have high entropy (many weak interactions) or complex tasks have low entropy (few but critical interactions), the metric may fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Curriculum progression based on combined complexity scores enables systematic skill transfer.
- Mechanism: Tasks are ordered by combined complexity C = 0.4·H(G) + 0.3·I + 0.3·O, progressing when agents achieve success rate > 0.6 or reach 300-episode timeout. This prevents training stagnation while ensuring skill development.
- Core assumption: Skills learned in lower-complexity tasks transfer to higher-complexity tasks with shared coordination structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "achieves strong empirical validation with ρ = 0.952 correlation... up to 56× performance improvement in tight coordination scenarios"
  - [section V.B.1, Table II]: MultiWalker shows 56× improvement vs. random sampling
  - [corpus]: Automatic curriculum design for zero-shot coordination (arXiv:2503.07275) addresses related curriculum questions but without complexity metrics.
- Break condition: If coordination patterns differ fundamentally across curriculum tasks, transfer may not occur despite complexity ordering.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Graph entropy and dependency graphs**
  - Why needed here: The core complexity metric relies on computing entropy over graph edge distributions; misunderstanding this yields incorrect difficulty predictions.
  - Quick check question: Given a 4-agent system where agents 1-2 interact frequently but agents 3-4 never interact, would graph entropy be high or low?

- Concept: **MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**
  - Why needed here: The framework uses MADDPG's centralized training with decentralized execution; understanding actor-critic architecture is essential for debugging training dynamics.
  - Quick check question: In MADDPG, does each agent's critic observe only local actions or global actions during training?

- Concept: **Curriculum learning principles**
  - Why needed here: The system orders tasks by predicted complexity; understanding why progression matters prevents misinterpreting baseline comparisons.
  - Quick check question: Why might learning from hardest tasks first (reverse curriculum) fail in multi-agent coordination scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Trajectory collector → Agent position data over time horizon T
  2. Dependency graph constructor → Proximity-based edge weights using θ = 0.5
  3. Complexity calculator → H(G) + I + O with weights [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]
  4. Curriculum scheduler → Task ordering + progression logic (success > 0.6 or 300 eps)
  5. Dynamic MADDPG → Adapts to varying agent counts/observation dims

- Critical path:
  1. Validate complexity metric on random-policy trajectories before training (target: ρ > 0.9)
  2. Verify graph construction captures meaningful interactions (visualize dependency matrices)
  3. Monitor curriculum progression—agents should advance through 80%+ of tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Proximity threshold θ = 0.5**: Lower values increase sensitivity to distant interactions (more edges, higher entropy); higher values may miss weak dependencies
  - **Progression threshold 0.6**: Higher values slow curriculum but ensure mastery; lower values risk insufficient skill development
  - **Weight allocation [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]**: Validated empirically but may not generalize to competitive or mixed-motive environments (acknowledged limitation)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Stuck at early tasks**: Check if complexity ordering is correct; random baseline should also struggle if metric is valid
  - **No progression difference vs. random sampling**: Environment may have loose coordination (like Simple Spread); curriculum benefits are environment-dependent
  - **Metric correlation drops below 0.8**: Re-validate weight parameters; task distribution may differ from validation set

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Metric validation**: Run random agents on 15 varied tasks, compute complexity scores, correlate with success rates—confirm ρ > 0.9
  2. **Single-environment curriculum test**: Train MADDPG with complexity curriculum vs. random sampling on MultiWalker—target >10× improvement
  3. **Ablation on components**: Remove each complexity component (H, I, O) individually and measure correlation drop—quantify component contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the graph-based complexity metric be extended to competitive or mixed-motive multi-agent environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VI states "The evaluation focuses on cooperative coordination scenarios. Competitive or mixed-motive environments would require different complexity formulations."
- Why unresolved: The current metric assumes cooperative coordination where goal overlap reflects shared objectives; adversarial settings involve opposing goals requiring fundamentally different complexity characterization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified metric formulation validated on competitive environments (e.g., predator-prey, zero-sum games) demonstrating significant correlation with empirical difficulty.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can complexity scores be estimated online during training rather than pre-computed from trajectories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VI and VIII note "real-world deployment would benefit from online complexity estimation during training" as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: Current approach requires computing complexity scores before training begins, limiting adaptability to agents' changing capabilities and preventing dynamic curriculum adjustment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of adaptive complexity estimation that updates during training, achieving comparable curriculum learning performance without pre-computed task rankings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do simulation-validated complexity patterns transfer to physical multi-robot coordination systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section VIII states "Future directions include validation on physical multi-robot systems" and "Real-world deployment would benefit from additional validation to confirm the transferability of simulation-based complexity patterns."
- Why unresolved: Physical systems introduce sensor noise, actuator delays, communication constraints, and safety considerations absent from PettingZoo simulations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical validation on physical multi-robot platforms showing similar complexity-difficulty correlations and curriculum learning benefits as observed in simulation.

## Limitations
- The metric assumes coordination primarily occurs through spatial proximity, which may not hold in communication-based coordination scenarios
- Weight allocation [0.4, 0.3, 0.3] was empirically optimized but lacks theoretical grounding for transfer to competitive environments
- Curriculum benefits are environment-dependent, showing minimal advantage in loose coordination tasks like Simple Spread

## Confidence

**High**: Empirical correlation between predicted complexity and random-agent performance (ρ = 0.952)

**Medium**: Performance improvements in MultiWalker (56×) and systematic progression in Simple Spread

**Medium**: Coordination tightness as predictor of curriculum effectiveness

## Next Checks

1. Test complexity metric correlation on communication-based coordination environments where proximity doesn't indicate dependency
2. Evaluate weight sensitivity by systematically varying [0.4, 0.3, 0.3] allocation and measuring performance impact
3. Validate transferability to competitive scenarios by applying metric to mixed-motive environments and measuring correlation degradation
