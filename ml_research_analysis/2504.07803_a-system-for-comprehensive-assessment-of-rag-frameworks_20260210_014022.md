# A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.07803
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: None reported

## Executive Summary
The paper presents SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular evaluation system designed to compare different RAG implementations across multiple knowledge bases and datasets. The framework addresses the growing need for systematic evaluation as RAG systems become increasingly complex with various architectures, optimization techniques, and deployment options. SCARF aims to provide a unified platform for assessing RAG frameworks beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

## Method Summary
SCARF is built as a modular system with two main components: the SCARF Modules, which contain specialized classes for dataset handling, model integration, and evaluation metrics, and the SCARF Evaluation Engine, which orchestrates the workflow. The system is designed to support multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, vLLM, Ollama), various knowledge base configurations, and different RAG architectures. The evaluation process involves loading datasets, querying RAG systems, collecting responses, and computing semantic scores across multiple dimensions including faithfulness, answer relevance, and information extraction.

## Key Results
- No specific results, outcomes, or hypotheses are reported in the paper
- The framework is presented as a tool for systematic RAG evaluation
- The modular design is described but not validated through comparative experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind SCARF's effectiveness lies in its modular architecture that separates data handling, model integration, and evaluation logic. This design allows for flexible swapping of components while maintaining consistent evaluation protocols. By supporting multiple LLM backends and knowledge bases, the system can provide comparative insights across different RAG implementations. The black-box evaluation approach treats RAG systems as query-response interfaces, enabling assessment without requiring access to internal components.

## Foundational Learning

**Modular evaluation frameworks** - why needed: Enable systematic comparison across different RAG implementations; quick check: Verify that each module has clear input/output interfaces

**Semantic evaluation metrics** - why needed: Move beyond simple accuracy to assess answer quality dimensions; quick check: Confirm metrics cover faithfulness, relevance, and coherence

**Knowledge base abstraction** - why needed: Allow evaluation across different document collections and structures; quick check: Ensure system can handle both structured and unstructured knowledge sources

**LLM backend abstraction** - why needed: Enable fair comparison across different model serving strategies; quick check: Verify consistent API handling across OpenAI, vLLM, and Ollama

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Configuration -> SCARF Modules (Dataset, Model, Evaluation) -> SCARF Evaluation Engine -> Backend RAG systems -> Knowledge bases -> Output reports

Critical path: User-defined configuration → Dataset loading → RAG query execution → Response collection → Semantic scoring → Comparative reporting

Design tradeoffs: Black-box evaluation vs. white-box analysis (black-box chosen for broader applicability); modular design vs. monolithic integration (modular chosen for flexibility)

Failure signatures: Backend connection failures, inconsistent response formats, metric computation errors, knowledge base loading issues

First experiments:
1. Run a basic evaluation with a single dataset and RAG backend to verify system functionality
2. Test the modular swapping capability by changing the LLM backend while keeping other components constant
3. Validate the evaluation metrics by comparing known-good and known-bad RAG responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can synthetic query generation be integrated to minimize human bias and effort in the evaluation process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion identifies the current reliance on manual queries as a limitation that introduces potential bias, proposing the integration of synthetic data generation as a "promising direction for improvement."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation requires users to manually define queries in the configuration, lacking an automated mechanism for generating diverse test cases from the knowledge base.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the SCARF Modules capable of autonomously creating and validating question-answer pairs from uploaded documents.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can system performance metrics (latency, stability, scalability) be incorporated alongside semantic metrics to assess real-world readiness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly list "system response time, latency, stability under load, and scalability" as evaluation criteria that are currently missing but necessary for a holistic assessment.
- Why unresolved: The current framework primarily outputs semantic scores (e.g., faithfulness) and response text, treating the RAG framework as a stateless black box without measuring resource consumption or throughput.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new module that logs infrastructure metrics during query execution and includes them in the final comparative report.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do specific LLM deployment optimizations (e.g., quantization, caching) impact the semantic quality of RAG responses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The introduction highlights that tools like vLLM and Ollama use optimization strategies that affect performance, but the paper does not present data on whether these strategies degrade answer correctness or faithfulness.
- Why unresolved: While SCARF supports swapping these backends, the paper provides no experimental analysis comparing the semantic scores of optimized vs. standard deployments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A benchmark study using SCARF to compare identical RAG pipelines where only the LLM serving strategy (e.g., full precision vs. quantization) is varied.

## Limitations
- No concrete results or validation data presented to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness
- Limited discussion of potential biases in evaluation datasets and scenarios
- Lack of reproducibility details including code or dataset availability
- Focus on black-box evaluation restricts depth of architectural analysis

## Confidence
Low - The paper presents a framework design but lacks empirical validation, specific results, or comparative analysis with existing approaches.

## Next Checks
1. Request access to the evaluation framework and datasets to replicate the experiments.
2. Compare the proposed metrics with established RAG evaluation benchmarks to assess their effectiveness.
3. Investigate potential biases in the evaluation scenarios and datasets to ensure robustness.
