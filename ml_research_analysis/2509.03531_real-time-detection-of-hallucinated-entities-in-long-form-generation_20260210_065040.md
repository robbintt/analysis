# Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.03531
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531
- Reference count: 40
- This work presents a scalable approach for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens by training lightweight probes that detect fabricated entities as they are generated.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses hallucination detection in long-form language model generation, where fabricated entities can cause serious harm in high-stakes applications. The authors present a scalable approach for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens by training lightweight probes that detect fabricated entities as they are generated. The method uses an annotation pipeline with web search to label entity spans as supported or fabricated, then trains linear and LoRA-based probes on hidden states to predict these labels at the token level. Across four model families, the probes achieve strong performance with AUC of 0.90 on Llama-3.3-70B compared to 0.71 for semantic entropy baselines, with effective generalization from long-form to short-form settings and across different models.

## Method Summary
The approach involves annotating entity spans in generated text as supported or fabricated using web search verification, then training lightweight probes (linear and LoRA-based) on hidden states to predict hallucination labels at the token level. The probes operate in real-time during generation, enabling systems to abstain from answering when hallucination risk is detected. LoRA probes with KL regularization balance detection performance with minimal behavioral changes to the underlying model. The method is evaluated across four model families with strong performance metrics and generalization capabilities.

## Key Results
- Probes achieve AUC of 0.90 on Llama-3.3-70B compared to 0.71 for semantic entropy baselines
- Effective generalization from long-form to short-form settings and across different models
- LoRA probes with KL regularization balance detection performance with minimal behavioral changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the observation that hallucinated entities leave distinct signatures in the model's hidden states. By training lightweight probes on these hidden representations, the system can detect these signatures in real-time as generation progresses. The use of LoRA-based probes allows for efficient fine-tuning that minimally impacts the base model's behavior while maintaining strong detection performance. The web-search-based annotation pipeline provides high-quality ground truth labels for training.

## Foundational Learning

**Entity Recognition and Verification**: Needed to identify and label entity spans in generated text. Quick check: Can the system correctly identify entities and distinguish between supported and fabricated ones using web search.

**Hidden State Analysis**: Needed to understand how hallucinations manifest in model representations. Quick check: Do hallucinated tokens produce distinguishable patterns in hidden states compared to supported ones.

**Probe Training**: Needed to create lightweight detection models. Quick check: Can linear and LoRA-based probes effectively learn to classify hidden states as hallucinated or supported.

**Real-time Generation Monitoring**: Needed for practical deployment. Quick check: Can the probes operate with low latency during ongoing generation without significantly slowing down the process.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Entity Recognition -> Web Search Annotation -> Hidden State Extraction -> Probe Training -> Real-time Detection -> Intervention Decision

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves entity recognition, hidden state extraction, and probe inference. Each token's hidden state must be processed through the probe to make real-time detection decisions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice between linear and LoRA probes involves balancing detection accuracy against model modification. Linear probes are simpler but LoRA probes offer better performance with minimal behavioral impact. The KL regularization helps maintain base model behavior while improving detection.

**Failure Signatures**: Probes may fail when faced with domain shifts beyond Wikipedia, when web search cannot verify entities, or when hallucinations involve subtle factual inconsistencies rather than outright fabrication. Performance may degrade on extremely long documents or in noisy real-world data.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train and evaluate linear probes on a small subset of annotated data to establish baseline performance
2. Compare linear vs LoRA probe performance on the same dataset to assess the tradeoff
3. Test probe generalization by evaluating on short-form generation after training on long-form data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on Wikipedia-based entity hallucination detection, potentially missing patterns in other domains
- Annotation pipeline relies on web search which may introduce incomplete ground truth labels
- Approach targets entity-level hallucination specifically and does not address other forms such as factual inconsistencies or logical contradictions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core methodology of using probe-based detection on hidden states is technically sound and well-implemented. The experimental results showing superior performance compared to semantic entropy baselines are robust and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness in truly high-stakes applications depends on the operational threshold chosen for intervention, which is not extensively explored.

**Low Confidence**: The scalability and performance of the approach in extremely long documents (beyond the tested range) and in non-Wikipedia domains remain uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. Test probe generalization on non-Wikipedia domains including biomedical, legal, and news articles to assess domain robustness.

2. Conduct human evaluation studies to measure the practical impact of real-time intervention thresholds on user experience and task completion in high-stakes scenarios.

3. Evaluate probe performance on document lengths exceeding 10,000 tokens to assess scalability limits and potential performance degradation.
