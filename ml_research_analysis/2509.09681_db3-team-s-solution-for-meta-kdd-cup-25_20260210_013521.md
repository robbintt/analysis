# DB3 Team's Solution For Meta KDD Cup' 25
- arXiv ID: 2509.09681
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09681
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: 2nd place Task 1, 2nd place Task 2, 1st place Task 3 in Meta CRAG-MM Challenge 2025

## Executive Summary
The DB3 team developed a multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation system for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge 2025, achieving second place in Task 1, second place in Task 2, and first place in Task 3, winning the grand prize for ego-centric query performance. The solution addresses multi-modal, multi-turn question answering by integrating domain-specific retrieval pipelines with hallucination control mechanisms. Key innovations include merged query rewriting for text-based retrieval, entity grounding in ego-centric images, and adaptive refusal strategies to maximize correct answers while minimizing incorrect responses.

## Method Summary
The system combines multi-modal retrieval with generation, using domain-specific retrieval pipelines including image-indexed knowledge graphs, web sources, and multi-turn conversation history. Hallucination control is implemented through supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning. The approach specifically addresses ego-centric image challenges through entity grounding and employs merged query rewriting to improve text-based retrieval effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Achieved 2nd place in Task 1, 2nd place in Task 2, and 1st place in Task 3
- Won the grand prize for ego-centric query performance
- Demonstrated superior handling of first-person perspective challenges in complex visual-linguistic reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation architecture that combines domain-specific retrieval pipelines with hallucination control mechanisms. By integrating image-indexed knowledge graphs, web sources, and conversation history, the system can access relevant information across multiple modalities. The hallucination control through supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning helps ensure generated responses remain grounded in retrieved evidence. The merged query rewriting and entity grounding specifically address the challenges of ego-centric image understanding, while adaptive refusal strategies optimize the balance between providing answers and avoiding incorrect responses.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation: Needed to handle complex visual-linguistic reasoning tasks; Quick check: System must successfully retrieve relevant information across text and image modalities
- Hallucination control through multi-stage fine-tuning: Needed to ensure response accuracy and reduce fabricated information; Quick check: Generated responses should match retrieved evidence without introducing unsupported claims
- Ego-centric image processing: Needed to handle first-person perspective challenges in visual understanding; Quick check: System should correctly identify and ground entities in first-person images
- Adaptive refusal strategies: Needed to optimize between providing answers and avoiding incorrect responses; Quick check: System should refuse to answer when confidence is low while maintaining high answer rates on confident predictions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** User query -> Query rewriting -> Multi-modal retrieval (KG, web, conversation) -> Evidence fusion -> Generation with hallucination control -> Adaptive refusal
**Critical path:** Query rewriting -> Retrieval (KG/web/conversation) -> Evidence fusion -> Generation -> Verification -> Response
**Design tradeoffs:** The system trades computational complexity for accuracy by using multiple retrieval sources and hallucination control mechanisms rather than simpler single-source approaches
**Failure signatures:** 
- Incorrect retrieval leading to hallucinated responses
- Entity grounding failures in ego-centric images
- Over-refusal or under-refusal based on adaptive strategy parameters
- Fusion failures when evidence from multiple sources conflicts

**First experiments:**
1. Test query rewriting effectiveness on benchmark multi-modal retrieval tasks
2. Evaluate entity grounding accuracy on ego-centric image datasets
3. Benchmark adaptive refusal strategy performance against fixed-threshold approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- System dependence on specific retrieval pipelines may not generalize to domains without similar structured data availability
- Effectiveness of hallucination control mechanisms remains partially validated without detailed ablation studies
- Limited qualitative analysis of first-person perspective challenges in ego-centric image handling

## Confidence
- High confidence in the overall system architecture and multi-modal integration approach
- Medium confidence in the claimed hallucination mitigation effectiveness due to limited comparative analysis with baseline hallucination control methods
- Medium confidence in the ego-centric image handling improvements, as the paper lacks extensive qualitative analysis of first-person perspective challenges

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of merged query rewriting, entity grounding, and adaptive refusal strategies to overall system performance
2. Test the system on datasets from different domains to evaluate generalization beyond the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge context
3. Implement and compare against alternative hallucination detection and mitigation approaches to benchmark the proposed multi-stage verification framework effectiveness
