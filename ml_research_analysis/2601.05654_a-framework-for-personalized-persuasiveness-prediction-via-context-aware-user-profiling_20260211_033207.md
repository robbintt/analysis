# A Framework for Personalized Persuasiveness Prediction via Context-Aware User Profiling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.05654
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05654
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** +13.77% absolute F1 score improvement in view-change prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a trainable user profiling framework for personalized persuasiveness prediction that addresses the gap in systematically leveraging a persuadee's past interactions. The method consists of two trainable components: a query generator that produces retrieval queries targeting persuasion-relevant user attributes, and a profiler that summarizes retrieved records into context-aware textual profiles. The framework is trained using view-change prediction performance as a supervision signal, with the profiler trained first via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and the query generator trained subsequently using utility-based query ranking. Evaluation on the ChangeMyView dataset shows consistent improvements across multiple predictor models, achieving up to +13.77% absolute F1 score gain over existing methods.

## Method Summary
The framework uses two trainable LLM-based components with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbones and LoRA fine-tuning. First, a query generator takes a post and generates retrieval queries through a two-stage process: identifying missing user attributes and contextualizing with post cues. Second, a profiler takes retrieved records and generates textual user profiles. Both components are trained using view-change prediction performance as supervision. The profiler is trained first via DPO using F1-based preference pairs, then record-level utility scores are computed through repeated prediction. Finally, the query generator is trained via DPO using NDCG@5 on these utility scores. The predictor (frozen) takes post, comment, and profile to make binary view-change predictions.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to +13.77% absolute F1 score improvement over existing methods on ChangeMyView dataset
- Query generation with DPO outperformed BGE-Post and HyDE baselines on NDCG@5 (0.6214 vs 0.6180, 0.6126)
- User profiles showed context-dependent effectiveness varying by post topic, claim type, and predictor model
- Cross-predictor agreement on record utility was low (Spearman ρ: -0.005 to 0.083), indicating predictor-specific value

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The profiler learns to generate profiles optimized for view-change prediction rather than generic user summarization.
- **Mechanism:** DPO training constructs preference pairs where profiles yielding higher F1 scores are treated as "chosen" and lower-scoring profiles as "rejected." The model learns to emphasize traits correlated with prediction success, dynamically adjusting emphasis across dimensions based on post characteristics.
- **Core assumption:** View-change prediction F1 provides a valid proxy signal for profile quality; multiple random record groupings expose sufficient variation for meaningful preference learning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "trained using view-change prediction performance as a supervision signal"
  - [Section 3.3.1] "Preference pairs are then constructed by pairing higher-scoring profiles with lower-scoring ones separated by a sufficient F1 margin"
  - [Figure 4] Shows correlation between dimension frequency shifts and performance gains varies by topic/claim type
- **Break condition:** If preference pairs lack sufficient F1 margin (noise dominates signal), or if record groupings are too homogeneous to create meaningful variation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Record-level utility scoring captures predictor-specific value of historical records for persuasion prediction.
- **Mechanism:** Each record is associated with 9 generated profiles (3 groupings × 3 profiles each). The aggregation of F1 scores from predictions using profiles containing that record serves as its utility estimate. High-utility records consistently appear in successful prediction contexts.
- **Core assumption:** A record's contribution can be estimated through repeated sampling; Shapley-like attribution holds approximately.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3.2] "aggregate the F1 scores from all view-change prediction instances performed using profiles that include record r"
  - [Table 4] Low cross-predictor agreement (Spearman ρ: -0.005 to 0.083) shows utility is predictor-specific
  - [corpus] Related work on temporal user profiling (FMR 0.479) suggests dynamic preference modeling is tractable, but lacks direct utility scoring validation
- **Break condition:** If records have highly interdependent value (context-sensitive combinations), individual scoring becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Two-stage query generation surfaces persuasion-relevant attributes absent from the post text.
- **Mechanism:** Stage 1 generates a user-focused question identifying missing attributes (e.g., values, reasoning styles). Stage 2 contextualizes this question with post cues into a retrieval query. DPO training prefers queries retrieving high-utility records (measured by NDCG@5 against utility scores).
- **Core assumption:** User attributes relevant to persuasion are inferable from post topic/stance; high-utility records share detectable patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.3.3] "CMV posts often lack explicit user-specific attributes critical for persuasion"
  - [Table 1] Query generation outperforms BGE-Post and HyDE on NDCG@5 (0.6214 vs 0.6180, 0.6126)
  - [Section 5.2] "low-scoring records are more likely than high-scoring ones to share the same topic"—semantic similarity alone is insufficient
- **Break condition:** If user attributes cannot be inferred from post content, or if retrieval target is fundamentally ambiguous.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
  - Why needed here: Core training method for both profiler and query generator without explicit reward model
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why DPO's implicit reward formulation avoids needing a separate reward model?

- **Concept: Data Shapley / Instance-level Value Attribution**
  - Why needed here: Underlies persuasion utility scoring—estimating individual record contribution via marginal performance
  - Quick check question: How would you validate that aggregate F1 over random groupings approximates true record utility?

- **Concept: Dense Retrieval with Learned Queries**
  - Why needed here: Query generator must produce queries that work with embedding-based retrievers (BGE-M3)
  - Quick check question: What failure modes occur when generated queries drift from the embedding space's training distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Query Generator → Retriever → Profiler → Predictor
- **Critical path:** Profiler training → Utility scoring → Query generator training → Inference (query → retrieve → profile → predict). Training order matters: profiler must be trained first to provide meaningful utility signals.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Random grouping count vs. compute cost (paper uses 3 groupings × 3 profiles = 9 per record)
  - Profile length vs. predictor context capacity
  - LoRA rank (32 for profiler, 16 for query generator) balances adaptation capacity vs. overfitting risk
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low preference pair margin (δ < 0.05) → noisy DPO signal
  - High top-k overlap across predictors → generic profiles (overfitting to similarity)
  - Utility scores with near-zero variance → uninformative retrieval supervision
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate profiler DPO: Compare profiles from trained vs. base profiler on held-out posts, measuring F1 delta stratified by topic/claim type (replicate Figure 3).
  2. Validate utility scoring: Correlate utility scores with ablation performance (remove top-5 vs. bottom-5 records, measure prediction degradation).
  3. End-to-end ablation: Swap query generator for BGE-Post baseline while keeping profiler fixed; isolate retrieval contribution (expect ~1-2% F1 delta per Table 3).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework maintain effectiveness when transferred to short-form or real-time interaction modalities?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] The Limitations section notes the study is restricted to "long-form textual discussions" on Reddit and that extending it to "short-form conversations or real-time recommendation settings" requires additional validation.
- Why unresolved: The CMV dataset relies on explicit "delta" signals and lengthy argumentation, which are structurally absent in rapid, short-form interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation on dialogue datasets with short turn lengths or live user studies in real-time coaching/chatbot scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is it possible to construct predictor-agnostic user profiles, or is re-training strictly necessary for different model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [Explicit] Section 5.2 analyzes cross-model patterns, finding "low agreement" in record utility (Spearman $\rho \approx 0$), and concludes that "record utility... is highly model-dependent."
- Why unresolved: The current training strategy optimizes profiles for a specific predictor's preferences, resulting in specialized rather than universal profile representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that generates profiles yielding high F1 scores across heterogeneous predictors (e.g., GPT-4 and Llama simultaneously) without predictor-specific tuning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does optimizing user profiles for prediction accuracy directly translate to improved performance in persuasive message generation?
- Basis in paper: [Inferred] The paper focuses entirely on view-change prediction ("predicting whether a view change occurs") and explicitly excludes intervention ("does not include any mechanisms for generating persuasive content").
- Why unresolved: It is undetermined if the profile features that help a model identify a successful argument are the same features required to synthesize one.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating the profiling framework into a generator model and measuring actual persuasion success rates in a controlled trial.

## Limitations
- Framework is restricted to long-form textual discussions and requires validation for short-form or real-time interaction modalities
- The utility scoring mechanism assumes individual record contributions are independent and additive, which may not hold in real-world persuasion contexts
- The method focuses on view-change prediction without providing mechanisms for generating persuasive content

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The two-stage query generation architecture and the overall improvement in view-change prediction F1 scores (up to +13.77%) are well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The DPO training methodology and the concept of predictor-specific utility scores are theoretically sound but require more empirical validation, particularly regarding the independence assumption in utility scoring.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that profiles should vary by topic and claim type (rather than using static attributes) is supported by analysis but could benefit from more systematic investigation of when and why this variability occurs.

## Next Checks

1. **Independence validation**: Design an experiment to test whether record contributions are truly independent by measuring prediction performance when combining high-utility records from different posts versus within the same post context.
2. **Cross-task generalization**: Evaluate the profiling framework on a different persuasion-related task (e.g., argument quality assessment or stance detection) to test whether the learned profiles transfer beyond view-change prediction.
3. **Interpretability audit**: Conduct a qualitative analysis of generated profiles to verify that they capture meaningful persuasion-relevant attributes rather than memorizing statistical patterns in the training data.
