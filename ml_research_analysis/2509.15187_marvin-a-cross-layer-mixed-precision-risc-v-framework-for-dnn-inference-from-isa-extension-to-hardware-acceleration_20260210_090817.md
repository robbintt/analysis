core_contribution: This work addresses the lack of efficient architectural support
  for mixed-precision neural network execution on embedded RISC-V processors, which
  leads to performance bottlenecks due to excessive data packing/unpacking and underutilized
  arithmetic units. The authors propose MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software co-design
  framework that extends the RISC-V ISA with nine new mixed-precision instructions
  and implements micro-architectural enhancements including configurable mixed-precision
  arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits), multi-pumping for reduced execution latency, and soft
  SIMD for efficient 2-bit operations.

# MaRVIn: A Cross-Layer Mixed-Precision RISC-V Framework for DNN Inference, from ISA Extension to Hardware Acceleration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.15187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15187
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Cross-layer RISC-V framework enabling 17.6× speedup and 1.8 TOPs/W efficiency for mixed-precision DNN inference

## Executive Summary
MaRVIn addresses the performance bottleneck in embedded RISC-V processors executing mixed-precision neural networks by providing a comprehensive hardware-software co-design framework. The framework extends the RISC-V ISA with nine new instructions specifically designed for mixed-precision operations, implements micro-architectural enhancements including configurable arithmetic units and soft SIMD capabilities, and integrates software-level optimizations for model quantization and design space exploration. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements while maintaining accuracy on standard vision models.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a cross-layer approach combining ISA extensions, micro-architectural enhancements, and software optimizations. Nine new RISC-V instructions enable efficient mixed-precision operations, while hardware modifications include configurable arithmetic units supporting 2, 4, and 8-bit precision with multi-pumping techniques. The software stack integrates pruning-aware fine-tuning and greedy-based design space exploration to identify optimal quantization strategies. Circuit-level optimizations through voltage scaling further enhance power efficiency, creating a comprehensive solution for efficient DNN inference on resource-constrained embedded platforms.

## Key Results
- Achieves 17.6× average speedup compared to baseline Ibex architecture
- Maintains less than 1% accuracy loss across tested DNN models
- Delivers up to 1.8 TOPs/W energy efficiency
- Validated on MobileNetV1, ResNet18, MCUNet, and LeNet across CIFAR10, ImageNet, and MNIST datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from eliminating the overhead of data packing/unpacking operations through dedicated ISA extensions, optimizing arithmetic unit utilization via configurable precision support, and reducing execution latency through multi-pumping techniques. The integration of software-level pruning-aware fine-tuning with hardware-aware design space exploration enables optimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, while voltage scaling exploits the reduced computational demands of quantized operations to improve power efficiency.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: RISC-V Core -> ISA Extension Unit -> Mixed-Precision Arithmetic Unit -> Memory Subsystem -> Software Stack (Pruning/Exploration Tools)

**Critical Path**: Instruction fetch/decode → ISA extension execution → Mixed-precision arithmetic computation → Result storage

**Design Tradeoffs**: Precision flexibility vs. hardware complexity, performance gain vs. accuracy retention, hardware area vs. energy efficiency

**Failure Signatures**: Accuracy degradation beyond acceptable thresholds, performance bottlenecks in specific precision configurations, power consumption exceeding targets

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Baseline performance measurement on unmodified Ibex core with full-precision operations
2. Single-instruction mixed-precision operation validation with accuracy verification
3. Multi-pumping technique timing characterization across different precision levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused on lightweight vision models may not generalize to complex architectures
- Comparative analysis against other RISC-V DNN accelerators is limited
- Practical implementation complexity and compiler support for new ISA extensions remain unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Architectural framework description and ISA extension details are well-articulated with clear implementation logic
- **Medium confidence**: Performance and efficiency claims are based on simulation results but lack validation on physical hardware prototypes
- **Medium confidence**: Accuracy retention claims are demonstrated on selected benchmarks but may not hold across diverse model architectures

## Next Checks
1. Physical hardware prototyping to verify reported performance and power efficiency metrics
2. Evaluation on additional DNN architectures including transformer-based models and non-vision tasks
3. Comprehensive compiler toolchain development and benchmarking to assess practical usability of new ISA extensions
