# AI-Supported Platform for System Monitoring and Decision-Making in Nuclear Waste Management with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21741
- Reference count: 0
- Multi-agent RAG system achieves higher relevance scores and improved decision consistency for nuclear waste regulatory compliance

## Executive Summary
This study presents a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for nuclear waste management regulatory compliance, addressing complex safety and legal requirements. The system integrates Llama 3.2 and mxbai-embed-large-v1 on consumer-grade hardware to enable document-grounded decision-making through structured agent collaboration. Evaluation of a proposed Arizona storage site showed the Regulatory Agent achieved higher relevance scores for legal alignment, while the Safety Agent effectively handled complex risk assessments. Agreement rates between agents increased and semantic drift decreased across discussion rounds, demonstrating improved decision consistency.

## Method Summary
The system implements a three-agent architecture (Regulatory Compliance, Safety & Environmental, and Documentation & Reporting) that engages in 10 rounds of structured discussion using RAG retrieval from regulatory and safety document repositories. Llama 3.2 serves as the local inference engine via Ollama, while mxbai-embed-large-v1 provides document chunking and query encoding. The system evaluates compliance assessments through Relevance Score (cosine similarity), Agreement Rate between agents, and Semantic Drift metrics. All operations are designed to run on consumer-grade hardware without cloud dependencies.

## Key Results
- Regulatory Agent achieved higher relevance scores for legal alignment, while Safety Agent effectively handled complex risk assessments
- Agreement rates between agents increased and semantic drift decreased across discussion rounds, demonstrating improved decision consistency
- System dynamically adapts to evolving regulatory frameworks while maintaining factual grounding through real-time document retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Retrieval-Augmented Generation grounds LLM responses in authoritative regulatory documents, reducing hallucination risk in compliance assessments.
- Mechanism: User queries are embedded using mxbai-embed-large-v1; cosine similarity retrieves contextually relevant passages from regulatory databases (DOE, NRC, IAEA, state agencies); Llama 3.2 conditions response generation on retrieved context rather than parametric knowledge alone.
- Core assumption: Embedding similarity accurately captures semantic relevance between queries and regulatory text chunks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "integrates large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval mechanisms to enhance decision accuracy through structured agent collaboration"
  - [section]: "This retrieval-augmented approach ensures agent discussions are grounded in factual, up-to-date regulatory and safety standards, minimizing semantic drift and misinformation"
  - [corpus]: CircuGraphRAG paper confirms similar mechanism: "grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific knowledge" for regulatory decisions
- Break condition: If document repository lacks recent regulatory updates, or embedding fails on domain-specific jargon, retrieved context will be incomplete or misaligned.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-agent iterative discussion improves decision consistency through structured consensus-building across specialized perspectives.
- Mechanism: Regulatory Compliance Agent (RCA) and Safety & Environmental Agent (SEA) query different document sources, exchange findings over 10 structured rounds; agreement rate increases as agents refine interpretations; semantic drift decreases as responses stay grounded.
- Core assumption: Agent specialization creates complementary perspectives that converge through dialogue rather than diverge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Agreement rates between agents increased and semantic drift decreased across discussion rounds, demonstrating improved decision consistency"
  - [section]: "The inverse relationship between rising Agreement Rates and declining Semantic Drift confirms effective regulatory assessment refinement through structured discussions"
  - [corpus]: SORA-ATMAS references "Multi-LLM Aligned Governance" for smart cities—similar multi-agent alignment concept, though different domain
- Break condition: If agent prompts lack clear role differentiation, or discussion rounds have no structured convergence criteria, agents may iterate without meaningful consensus.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consumer-grade hardware deployment with smaller models (Llama 3.2) maintains adequate performance when augmented by domain-specific retrieval.
- Mechanism: Local inference via Ollama eliminates cloud dependency; smaller model parameters reduce memory requirements; RAG compensates for reduced parametric knowledge by injecting external context.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific retrieval can compensate for smaller model reasoning limitations in specialized regulatory tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Implemented on consumer-grade hardware, the system leverages Llama 3.2 and mxbai-embed-large-v1 embeddings for efficient retrieval"
  - [section]: "We recognize that using cloud-based large language models (LLMs) is not sustainable, both financially and environmentally... we aim to develop a system that operates effectively on consumer-level computers"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence—no directly comparable local deployment RAG systems found in neighbors
- Break condition: If document corpus scales significantly or concurrent query load increases, consumer hardware memory/latency may become insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for grounding agent responses in regulatory documents rather than relying on potentially outdated or hallucinated model knowledge.
  - Quick check question: Given a query about "geological stability requirements," how would you verify that retrieved chunks are from authoritative sources (USGS vs. generic web content)?

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**:
  - Why needed here: Nuclear waste governance requires integrating legal, environmental, and safety perspectives—no single agent captures all constraints.
  - Quick check question: If Regulatory Agent and Safety Agent disagree after round 5, what structured mechanism should determine whether to continue discussion or escalate to human review?

- **Herbert Simon's Decision-Making Phases (Intelligence → Design → Choice)**:
  - Why needed here: The framework maps agents to phases (Intelligence: data gathering; Design: solution crafting; Choice: final recommendation), ensuring systematic coverage.
  - Quick check question: Which phase would document retrieval belong to, and which would the final compliance report generation belong to?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Ollama (Llama 3.2) -> mxbai-embed-large-v1 -> Document Repositories (DOE, NRC, IAEA, EPA, USGS, state agencies) -> Three Agents (Regulatory Compliance, Safety & Environmental, Documentation & Reporting) -> Orchestrator (10-round discussion) -> Evaluation (Relevance Score, Agreement Rate, Semantic Drift) -> Human Review (optional)

- **Critical path**:
  Query -> Embedding -> Document Retrieval -> Agent Specialization (RCA/SEA parallel queries) -> 10-Round Discussion Loop -> Agreement Check -> DRA Report Compilation -> Human Review (optional)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. Latency: More discussion rounds improve consensus but increase inference time × agents × rounds
  - Model size vs. Hardware: Llama 3.2 enables consumer hardware but may struggle with complex regulatory reasoning without retrieval
  - Static vs. Dynamic documents: Pre-indexed corpus ensures quality but cannot capture real-time regulatory updates without re-indexing

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low relevance scores (<0.5) -> embedding mismatch or incomplete document corpus
  - High semantic drift (>0.3) across rounds -> agents losing document grounding, discussion prompt issues
  - Agreement rate plateau <70% after round 8 -> fundamental agent conflict, may require human intervention
  - Memory errors on consumer hardware -> reduce concurrent agents or chunk size

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline retrieval quality: Measure precision/recall of document retrieval for 20 regulatory queries against ground-truth relevant passages; identify embedding failure modes on domain jargon.
  2. Single-agent vs. multi-agent comparison: Run identical compliance queries through single RAG pipeline vs. multi-agent discussion; compare relevance scores and semantic drift to quantify multi-agent benefit.
  3. Discussion round sensitivity: Vary rounds (3, 5, 10, 15) on same queries; plot agreement rate and semantic drift curves to identify convergence point and diminishing returns threshold.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can integrating multi-modal data sources (e.g., satellite imagery, sensor readings) significantly improve the system's ability to assess site stability and environmental compliance compared to text-only analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that future research should expand the system to "multi-modal processing capabilities" to better analyze real-time site conditions and geological formations.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies exclusively on text-based document retrieval and lacks the capacity to ingest or interpret visual or sensor data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study measuring the accuracy and robustness of compliance assessments when agents are augmented with geospatial and sensor data streams versus the text-only baseline.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How effective are reinforcement learning techniques at optimizing response coherence and minimizing semantic drift in multi-agent regulatory discussions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "reinforcement learning to enhance response coherence" as a specific direction for future enhancements to address current limitations in semantic drift.
- Why unresolved: The existing system uses a static structured discussion model without learning from historical decision trends or feedback loops to refine agent behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing reduced semantic drift scores and higher agreement rates in agents trained with RL compared to the current Llama 3.2 implementation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the system maintain computational efficiency and decision accuracy when scaled to decentralized, multi-stakeholder deployment environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors call for "scalability testing, particularly in decentralized deployment environments," to ensure the system remains efficient for real-world implementation across government and private sectors.
- Why unresolved: The current validation was conducted on a single consumer-grade machine (Sol supercomputer/Ollama) and did not test distributed decision-making latency or synchronization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks (latency, throughput, and consistency) from a distributed pilot study involving multiple distinct agencies accessing the system simultaneously.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a single case study without comparison to ground-truth regulatory assessments or expert human judgment
- Paper does not specify document versions, chunk sizes, or embedding retrieval parameters, making faithful reproduction challenging
- Claimed benefits of multi-agent iteration lack comparison to single-agent RAG baselines

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The technical feasibility of implementing multi-agent RAG on consumer hardware with Llama 3.2 and document retrieval is well-supported by the described architecture and evaluation metrics.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that structured agent discussions improve decision consistency is supported by observed trends in agreement rates and semantic drift, but lacks comparison to alternative approaches.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that this system can handle evolving regulatory frameworks is theoretical, as the evaluation covers only static documents without demonstrating dynamic adaptation to regulatory changes.

## Next Checks
1. **Baseline Comparison Study**: Implement identical queries using a single-agent RAG pipeline with the same document corpus and compare relevance scores, agreement rates (against ground-truth expert assessments), and semantic drift over equivalent discussion rounds to quantify the multi-agent advantage.

2. **Document Update Responsiveness Test**: Simulate regulatory changes by updating 20% of the document corpus with modified requirements, then measure how quickly and accurately the system identifies and incorporates these changes across multiple query iterations.

3. **Expert Validation Study**: Have nuclear waste regulatory experts independently assess 10-15 compliance queries and compare their judgments to the system's final reports, calculating precision, recall, and inter-rater reliability to establish real-world accuracy benchmarks.
