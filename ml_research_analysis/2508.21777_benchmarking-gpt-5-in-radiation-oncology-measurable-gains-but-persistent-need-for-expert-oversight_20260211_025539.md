# Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology: Measurable Gains, but Persistent Need for Expert Oversight

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21777
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21777
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GPT-5 achieved 92.8% accuracy on ACR TXIT exam, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%)

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks GPT-5 against GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in radiation oncology using both standardized multiple-choice exams (ACR TXIT) and real-world clinical vignettes. GPT-5 demonstrates significant performance improvements, particularly in dose calculation and diagnosis domains. However, the study reveals persistent challenges with complex clinical scenarios requiring trial-specific knowledge, where errors cluster despite high overall accuracy. The findings indicate that while GPT-5 represents a substantial advancement in medical AI reasoning capabilities, expert oversight remains essential for clinical deployment.

## Method Summary
The study employed two complementary evaluation approaches: a standardized 300-question ACR TXIT multiple-choice exam administered across five independent runs, and a novel set of 60 real-world clinical vignettes covering six tumor sites. For the vignettes, GPT-5 generated structured therapeutic plans that were evaluated by four board-certified radiation oncologists using 4-point Likert scales for correctness and comprehensiveness, with hallucination detection as a binary metric. All API calls were made in isolated sessions to prevent context leakage, and results were analyzed for overall accuracy, domain-specific performance, and inter-rater agreement.

## Key Results
- GPT-5 achieved 92.8% accuracy on ACR TXIT exam, significantly outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%)
- In vignette evaluation, GPT-5 generated treatment plans rated 3.24/4 for correctness and 3.59/4 for comprehensiveness
- Hallucinations were rare (10% of cases), but substantive errors occurred in complex scenarios requiring trial-specific knowledge
- Lowest performance was observed in rectal/anal cases (2.33-3.00) and NSCLC re-irradiation (2.54)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reasoning-focused reinforcement learning improves structured clinical output generation. RL training with reasoning-specific reward models enables better logical consistency and explicit rationale generation, producing coherent treatment plans with structured therapeutic recommendations. Core assumption: reasoning-focused training transfers to medical domain without domain-specific fine-tuning. Break condition: Complex multi-modal cases requiring trial-specific knowledge beyond training data cutoff.

### Mechanism 2
Mixture-of-Experts architecture enables heterogeneous domain coverage. Sparse expert routing activates specialized sub-networks per knowledge domain, achieving high accuracy in statistics/CNS/physics (≥95%) while maintaining gaps in gynecology (75%) and brachytherapy (88.9%). Core assumption: Expert routing activates appropriately for medical queries without explicit domain labels. Break condition: Cases requiring integration across multiple expert domains simultaneously.

### Mechanism 3
Constrained output formatting with required elements improves clinical comprehensiveness. Explicit prompt instructions specifying disease stage, treatment intent, dose/fractionation, and target volumes create a structured output schema, yielding higher comprehensiveness (3.59/4) than correctness (3.24/4). Core assumption: Improvement stems from prompting architecture rather than intrinsic model capability. Break condition: Cases where multiple guideline-concordant options exist and format constraints oversimplify clinical nuance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Exam benchmark vs. vignette evaluation gap**
  - Why needed here: TXIT accuracy (92.8%) does not predict vignette correctness (3.24/4 ≈ 81%); understanding this gap is essential for deployment decisions
  - Quick check question: Why might a model score 92.8% on multiple-choice questions but receive only 3.24/4 from practicing oncologists on real cases?

- **Concept: Inter-rater variability (Fleiss' κ)**
  - Why needed here: κ=0.083 for correctness indicates that even experts disagree on what constitutes a "correct" treatment plan
  - Quick check question: If four oncologists cannot agree on correctness, how should we interpret GPT-5's "errors"?

- **Concept: Hallucination vs. accuracy error distinction**
  - Why needed here: Paper reports rare hallucinations (10%, no majority consensus) but substantive errors in trial-specific knowledge—these require different mitigation strategies
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between a fabricated trial citation (hallucination) vs. an outdated dosing regimen (accuracy error)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** De-identified vignettes → Prompt engineering with required output elements → GPT-5 API (MoE backbone + reasoning RL) → Structured JSON output → Expert blind rating

- **Critical path:**
  1. Vignette creation (de-identification, condensation by physicians)
  2. Prompt engineering with required output elements
  3. Isolated API calls (no cross-case context leakage)
  4. Expert blind rating (correctness, comprehensiveness, hallucination binary)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - No external retrieval: Ensures reproducibility but prevents real-time guideline/trial access
  - Board-certified raters: Clinical validity but high inter-rater variability (κ=0.083)
  - Fixed prompts: Consistency across runs but may not optimize per-case

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Lowest correctness: Rectal/anal (2.33-3.00), NSCLC re-irradiation (2.54), brain metastases (2.67)
  - Error clustering: Trial-specific knowledge, precise dose/fractionation, multi-modal sequencing
  - Image interpretation: 2/7 correct on visual questions

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Compare performance with vs. without retrieval-augmented access to current trial databases (NCCN/ESMO/ESTRO)
  2. Stratify by case complexity (single-modality definitive vs. multi-modal re-irradiation) to identify break points
  3. A/B test structured vs. free-form prompting to isolate prompt architecture effects from model capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. Does integrating GPT-5 into multidisciplinary tumor board workflows improve decision-making efficiency or guideline concordance compared to standard care?
   - Basis: Discussion explicitly states future research should "prioritize prospective studies, ideally randomizing tumor-board workflows to model-assisted versus control arms."
   - Unresolved: Current study used retrospective vignettes and offline evaluation, not assessing real-time clinical dynamics or team decision-making latency.
   - Resolution: Randomized controlled trial measuring time-to-consensus and guideline adherence in tumor boards with and without GPT-5 assistance.

2. To what extent does coupling GPT-5 with real-time retrieval (RAG) tools reduce errors in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge?
   - Basis: Authors identify "absence of tool use and external retrieval" as a limitation and call for "systematic evaluation of reasoning under tool use."
   - Unresolved: Errors clustered in cases requiring up-to-date trial data or specific biomarker knowledge, which the static model may have lacked or hallucinated due to training cutoffs.
   - Resolution: Comparative benchmark of GPT-5 performance on trial-anchored vignettes with and without access to live guideline databases.

3. Can domain-specific fine-tuned models outperform general-purpose GPT-5 in low-accuracy subdomains such as Gynecology or Brachytherapy?
   - Basis: Discussion suggests "direct comparisons of general-purpose and domain-adapted models" as necessary future direction.
   - Unresolved: While GPT-5 achieved high overall accuracy, it showed relative weakness in Gynecology (75%) and Brachytherapy (88.9%), suggesting domain-specific training might yield better results.
   - Resolution: Head-to-head accuracy testing on ACR TXIT subsets for Gynecology and Brachytherapy between GPT-5 and a radiation-oncology-specific fine-tuned model.

## Limitations

- No domain-specific fine-tuning for GPT-5, restricting performance gains to general reasoning improvements and prompt engineering alone
- Inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' κ = 0.083) suggests inherent variability in expert consensus on "correct" treatment plans
- Relies entirely on retrospective vignette data without real-time clinical validation or prospective outcome tracking

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: GPT-5's superior performance on standardized multiple-choice examinations (92.8% vs. GPT-4's 78.8%) is well-supported by five independent runs with consistent results.

**Medium Confidence**: The vignette evaluation results (correctness 3.24/4, comprehensiveness 3.59/4) are reliable but interpretation is complicated by low inter-rater agreement.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that reasoning-focused reinforcement learning is the primary driver of performance gains cannot be independently verified without access to the model's training methodology.

## Next Checks

1. Re-run the vignette evaluation with GPT-5 having access to current NCCN/ESMO/ESTRO guidelines and clinical trial databases to determine if performance gaps stem from knowledge cutoff rather than reasoning capability.

2. Implement GPT-5 in a clinical setting with prospective data collection, tracking both physician acceptance rates and patient outcomes to validate retrospective performance claims.

3. Conduct a Delphi study with the four raters to establish consensus definitions for "correctness" and "comprehensiveness" in radiation oncology treatment planning, reducing the ambiguity that currently limits result interpretation.
