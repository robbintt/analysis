# A Probabilistic Model for Node Classification in Directed Graphs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.01630
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01630
- **Authors**: Diego Huerta; Gerardo Arizmendi
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Probabilistic generative model for node classification in directed graphs with competitive performance on Math Genealogy Project and ogbn-arxiv datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a probabilistic generative model for node classification in directed graphs where nodes have attributes and labels. The model makes predictions using either maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimations and is highly interpretable compared to common methods like graph neural networks. The model is applied to two datasets, including a new dataset adapted from the Math Genealogy Project, and demonstrates competitive predictive performance with state-of-the-art methods. The model uses additive smoothing for parameter estimation and can handle both text and non-text attributes.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a probabilistic generative model for node classification in directed graphs that models the joint distribution of labels, attributes, and graph structure. The model estimates parameters using maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori approaches with additive smoothing. It can handle both text and non-text attributes through appropriate probability distributions. The inference process involves calculating posterior probabilities for each node's label given its attributes and the graph structure, making the model inherently interpretable through its probabilistic framework.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1-score of 0.5705 on the newly constructed Math Genealogy Project dataset
- Obtained accuracy of 0.7432 on the ogbn-arxiv dataset
- Outperformed several baseline methods while maintaining high interpretability compared to GNNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model works by explicitly modeling the joint probability distribution of node attributes, labels, and graph structure using a generative approach. Unlike discriminative methods like GNNs that directly learn mappings from features to labels, this probabilistic framework captures the underlying data generation process, making it more interpretable. The use of maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation allows for principled handling of uncertainty and incorporation of prior knowledge through additive smoothing.

## Foundational Learning
- **Probabilistic generative modeling**: Needed to understand how the model captures data generation processes; check by verifying the joint probability formulation
- **Maximum likelihood vs maximum a posteriori estimation**: Required for parameter estimation; check by comparing MLE and MAP results
- **Additive smoothing (Laplace smoothing)**: Used to handle zero probabilities in parameter estimation; check by examining parameter values with and without smoothing
- **Directed graph structure**: Essential for modeling parent-child relationships; check by analyzing the adjacency matrix handling
- **Text attribute processing**: Needed for handling textual node attributes; check by verifying text preprocessing and probability estimation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data preprocessing -> Parameter estimation (MLE/MAP) -> Posterior calculation -> Label prediction

**Critical path**: The critical computational path involves parameter estimation using additive smoothing, followed by posterior probability calculation for each node, and final label prediction through maximum probability selection.

**Design tradeoffs**: The model trades computational efficiency for interpretability, as probabilistic calculations are generally more expensive than deep learning inference but provide clearer decision rationales. The additive smoothing parameter α=0.1 is heuristic and may not be optimal across datasets.

**Failure signatures**: The model may fail when the homophily assumption is violated (connected nodes don't share labels), when attribute distributions are highly skewed, or when the additive smoothing parameter is poorly chosen leading to over-regularization.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare model performance with and without additive smoothing on synthetic data with known label distributions
2. Test sensitivity to the smoothing parameter α by varying it from 0.01 to 1.0 on the Math Genealogy dataset
3. Evaluate interpretability by comparing feature importance rankings with GNN attention weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance gains may not generalize to graphs with different structural properties or attribute distributions
- The ogbn-arxiv dataset is undirected, creating a discrepancy with the model's design for directed graphs
- The interpretability claims lack quantitative comparison with other interpretable graph methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The mathematical formulation of the generative model and the basic implementation approach are sound
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance metrics on the tested datasets, though generalizability is uncertain
- **Low confidence**: Claims about superior interpretability and the general applicability of the additive smoothing parameter choice

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on additional directed graph datasets with varying homophily ratios, graph sizes, and attribute types to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of the additive smoothing parameter α and explore adaptive parameter selection methods
3. Implement quantitative measures of interpretability and compare with other interpretable graph classification methods using standardized benchmarks
