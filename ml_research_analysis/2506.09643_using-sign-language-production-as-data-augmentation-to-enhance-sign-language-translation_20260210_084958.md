# Using Sign Language Production as Data Augmentation to enhance Sign Language Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.09643
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09643
- Authors: Harry Walsh; Maksym Ivashechkin; Richard Bowden
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sign Language Production (SLP) augmentation improves SLT performance by up to 19% BLEU

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using Sign Language Production (SLP) as a data augmentation technique to improve Sign Language Translation (SLT) performance. The authors employ three augmentation methods: skeleton-based sign stitching, SignGAN for photo-realistic generation, and SignSplat for appearance augmentation. These methods are evaluated on the PHOENIX14T dataset using both Video-to-Text (V2T) and Pose-to-Text (P2T) SLT models. Results demonstrate significant improvements in translation accuracy, with skeleton-based augmentation proving most effective. The work addresses the data scarcity challenge in SLT by synthetically generating diverse sign language samples that can enhance model training and generalization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses Sign Language Production (SLP) to generate synthetic data for augmenting existing sign language datasets. Three techniques are employed: (1) a skeleton-based approach using sign stitching to create synthetic skeleton sequences by combining segments from different signs, (2) SignGAN for photo-realistic appearance generation of signers, and (3) SignSplat for visual augmentation of signer appearance. These augmented datasets are then used to train SLT models, with evaluation showing improved translation accuracy compared to baseline models trained on original data alone.

## Key Results
- Skeleton-based augmentation (sign stitching) showed the most consistent improvements across all experiments
- Photo-realistic augmentations (SignGAN and SignSplat) produced mixed results, with SignSplat generally outperforming SignGAN
- Maximum observed improvement of 19% BLEU score when using sign stitching for pre-training
- Skeleton-based augmentation proved particularly effective when used for pre-training SLT models
- Visual augmentations showed less consistent benefits, suggesting implementation quality significantly impacts performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed augmentation methods work by expanding the diversity of training data available to SLT models. Sign language datasets are typically small compared to spoken language datasets, limiting model generalization. By synthetically generating new sign sequences through sign stitching and appearance augmentation, the models are exposed to a broader range of sign variations, speeds, and visual contexts. This expanded training distribution helps SLT models better handle the natural variability present in real sign language communication, leading to improved translation accuracy across different signing styles and contexts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sign Language Translation (SLT)**: The task of converting sign language videos or poses into spoken language text. Needed to understand the target application and evaluation metrics.
- **Sign Language Production (SLP)**: The generation of synthetic sign language sequences. Required to grasp the augmentation methodology being proposed.
- **Data Augmentation in SLT**: Techniques to artificially expand sign language datasets. Essential for understanding how synthetic data can address resource constraints.
- **Skeleton-based Sign Processing**: Extracting and manipulating skeletal joint positions from sign videos. Critical for understanding the sign stitching approach.
- **Photo-realistic Generative Models**: GAN-based approaches for generating realistic sign language videos. Important for evaluating the visual augmentation methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Original Dataset -> Augmentation Pipeline (Skeleton-based + Visual) -> Augmented Dataset -> SLT Model (V2T/P2T) -> Translation Output

**Critical Path:**
Data Preparation → Skeleton Extraction → Sign Stitching → Visual Augmentation → Model Training → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The choice between skeleton-based and appearance-based augmentation involves balancing computational efficiency with visual realism. Skeleton-based methods are computationally lighter and more consistent but lack visual detail. Photo-realistic methods provide better visual quality but require more computational resources and may introduce artifacts that could confuse the SLT model.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Overfitting to synthetic patterns if augmentation diversity is insufficient
- Degraded translation quality if visual augmentations introduce unnatural artifacts
- Limited generalization if augmentation doesn't cover the full range of signing variations

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare translation performance using only skeleton-based augmentation versus only visual augmentation
2. Evaluate the impact of augmentation ratio (synthetic:real data ratio) on translation quality
3. Test different pre-training strategies using augmented data before fine-tuning on original dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single dataset (PHOENIX14T), limiting generalizability to other sign languages
- Photo-realistic augmentations showed mixed results, suggesting implementation quality significantly impacts effectiveness
- The 19% BLEU improvement represents maximum observed performance rather than typical gains
- Assumes access to skeleton extraction and pre-trained generative models, which may not be available for all sign languages

## Confidence
- High confidence in the general finding that data augmentation can improve SLT performance
- Medium confidence in the relative effectiveness of different augmentation techniques due to mixed results with visual methods
- Medium confidence in the magnitude of improvements, given single-dataset evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the proposed augmentation methods across multiple sign language datasets and languages to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of skeleton-based versus appearance-based augmentation techniques
3. Analyze the quality and diversity of synthetic samples generated by each method to understand their impact on model generalization
