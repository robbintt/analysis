# Preserving Cross-Modal Stability for Visual Unlearning in Multimodal Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23895
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Cross-modal contrastive unlearning framework that achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement while eliminating visual data influence in multimodal scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of visual modality unlearning in multimodal systems where visual data poses the highest privacy risk. Existing unlearning methods fail to maintain cross-modal knowledge stability, resulting in degraded performance across other modalities after visual data removal. The authors propose a novel Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) framework that preserves both cross-modal knowledge and intra-class structural stability during the unlearning process. The framework demonstrates superior performance across three datasets, achieving significant accuracy improvements while maintaining computational efficiency compared to baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The CCU framework introduces a three-component approach to visual unlearning: selective visual unlearning through inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual representations from original semantics, cross-modal knowledge retention to preserve discriminability of other modalities via semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation to isolate structural perturbations between unlearn and retain sets. This design enables effective elimination of visual data influence while maintaining model utility and cross-modal knowledge integrity. The framework addresses the fundamental challenge of removing sensitive visual information without compromising the overall multimodal system performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement compared to top-accuracy baseline in multimodal unlearning scenarios
- Reduces unlearning time to only 7% of baseline method's computational requirements
- Successfully eliminates visual data influence while preserving cross-modal knowledge across three diverse datasets (MM-IMDb, Fashion200k, HatefulMemes)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency through contrastive learning mechanisms that preserve relationships between modalities while removing visual-specific information. The inverse contrastive learning component actively dissociates visual features from their original semantic associations, preventing privacy leakage. The dual-set contrastive separation ensures that structural perturbations affecting unlearn and retain sets remain isolated, preventing cross-contamination of information during the unlearning process.

## Foundational Learning
- Contrastive learning fundamentals: Essential for understanding how the framework maintains semantic relationships while removing specific modality information
- Multimodal representation learning: Critical for grasping how cross-modal knowledge preservation operates
- Privacy-preserving machine learning: Provides context for why visual modality presents unique unlearning challenges
- Inverse learning techniques: Explains the mechanism for dissociating visual features from semantics
- Structural stability in neural networks: Important for understanding intra-class consistency preservation
- Quick check: Verify understanding of how contrastive loss functions operate in multimodal settings

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Visual Unlearning Module -> Cross-modal Knowledge Retention -> Dual-set Contrastive Separation
- Critical path: Inverse contrastive learning for visual dissociation → semantic consistency preservation → structural perturbation isolation
- Design tradeoffs: Computational efficiency versus complete privacy guarantee, balanced through selective unlearning approach
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation in non-visual modalities, incomplete visual information removal, cross-modal knowledge contamination
- First experiments: 1) Baseline unlearning performance comparison, 2) Cross-modal knowledge retention evaluation, 3) Visual information leakage testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three specific datasets, raising concerns about generalization to broader multimodal scenarios
- No formal privacy guarantees or membership inference resistance metrics provided
- Computational overhead characterization during unlearning process remains incomplete
- Assumption of clean structural perturbation isolation may not hold in high inter-class similarity datasets

## Confidence
- Visual data influence elimination: Medium confidence (lacks rigorous privacy metrics)
- 7.12% accuracy improvement: High confidence (well-supported by controlled experiments)
- Cross-modal knowledge preservation: Medium confidence (limited dataset diversity)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies on diverse multimodal datasets (medical imaging with text reports, satellite imagery with metadata) to verify cross-domain generalization of CCU's effectiveness.
2. Implement rigorous privacy auditing using membership inference attacks and differential privacy metrics to quantify actual visual data removal effectiveness versus claimed "elimination."
3. Evaluate CCU's performance under realistic operational constraints including streaming data scenarios, partial modality availability, and noisy or incomplete training data conditions.
