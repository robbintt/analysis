# From Neurons to Semantics: Evaluating Cross-Linguistic Alignment Capabilities of Large Language Models via Neurons Alignment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.14900
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14900
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: NeuronXA achieves Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream task performance using only 100 parallel sentence pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NeuronXA, a novel evaluation framework for assessing cross-lingual alignment in large language models (LLMs) based on neuron activation states. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research showing that similar stimuli activate overlapping neural regions, NeuronXA leverages the intrinsic representations captured by neuron activations to measure alignment consistency between parallel sentences across languages. The framework is evaluated across seven prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, OLMo) using two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks, demonstrating strong effectiveness in predicting cross-lingual alignment capabilities with minimal data requirements.

The proposed method shows superior performance compared to traditional embedding-based approaches, particularly in semantic retrieval tasks, while requiring only 100 parallel sentence pairs for evaluation. The analysis reveals that middle layers exhibit the highest alignment scores while lower and upper layers show the lowest, providing insights into how cross-lingual alignment capabilities are distributed across model architectures. These findings validate NeuronXA as a robust, semantically grounded approach for evaluating cross-lingual alignment in multilingual LLMs.

## Method Summary
NeuronXA operates by analyzing neuron activation states from LLMs when processing parallel sentences across different languages. The framework computes alignment scores based on the consistency of neuron activations for semantically equivalent sentences, treating these activations as intrinsic representations of semantic content. The evaluation process involves processing parallel sentence pairs through the target LLM, extracting neuron activation states from multiple layers, and computing alignment metrics that capture the degree of cross-lingual consistency. The method is designed to require minimal parallel data (only 100 sentence pairs) while providing reliable predictions of cross-lingual alignment capabilities.

## Key Results
- NeuronXA achieves Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream task performance using only 100 parallel sentence pairs
- NeuronXA demonstrates Pearson correlation of 0.8514 with transferability across evaluated models
- Middle layers consistently show highest alignment scores, while lower and upper layers exhibit lowest scores across all tested models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NeuronXA leverages the principle that similar semantic content activates similar neural patterns across languages, mirroring findings from neuroscience where similar stimuli activate overlapping brain regions. By treating neuron activations as intrinsic semantic representations, the method captures cross-lingual alignment at a fundamental level of model computation. This approach is more direct and semantically grounded than traditional embedding-based methods, as it measures alignment at the level where semantic processing actually occurs within the model architecture.

## Foundational Learning
**Cross-lingual Alignment**: The ability of models to map semantically equivalent content across different languages to similar representations - needed because this determines model performance on multilingual tasks; quick check: evaluate on parallel sentence pairs and measure representation similarity
**Neuron Activation States**: The pattern of neuron firings when processing specific inputs - needed because these capture the intrinsic semantic processing within models; quick check: compare activation patterns for semantically equivalent sentences
**Layer-wise Analysis**: Examining model behavior at different depth levels - needed because alignment capabilities vary significantly across layers; quick check: measure alignment scores at each layer and identify patterns

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input sentences -> LLM processing -> Neuron activation extraction -> Alignment score computation -> Cross-lingual capability prediction
**Critical Path**: Parallel sentence pairs → LLM inference → Neuron activation state extraction → Alignment metric calculation → Correlation with downstream performance
**Design Tradeoffs**: Minimal parallel data requirement vs. comprehensive coverage; neuron-level analysis vs. computational efficiency; layer-wise granularity vs. simplicity
**Failure Signatures**: Poor correlation with downstream tasks indicates alignment measurement issues; inconsistent layer-wise patterns suggest model-specific anomalies; high variance across language pairs indicates benchmark limitations
**First Experiments**: 1) Verify neuron activation consistency for identical sentences across runs, 2) Test alignment score sensitivity to neuron activation normalization methods, 3) Validate correlation results with larger parallel datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited sample size (100 sentence pairs) may affect statistical reliability of correlation claims
- Benchmark dependency raises concerns about generalizability to diverse semantic scenarios
- Layer-wise alignment patterns need validation across broader model diversity

## Confidence
- Correlation with downstream performance: Medium - Strong statistical results but limited sample size
- Layer-wise alignment patterns: Medium - Interesting findings but need broader validation
- Superiority over embedding-based approaches: Medium - Demonstrated in specific tasks but scope limited
- Cross-lingual transferability insights: Medium - Promising but benchmark-constrained

## Next Checks
1. Validate correlation results using larger parallel sentence datasets (minimum 500 pairs) across multiple language families
2. Test layer-wise alignment patterns on additional model families including smaller and larger parameter models
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine sensitivity of alignment scores to different neuron activation normalization methods and layer selection strategies
