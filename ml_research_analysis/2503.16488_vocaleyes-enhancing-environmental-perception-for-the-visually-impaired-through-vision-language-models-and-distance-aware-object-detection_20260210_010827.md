# VocalEyes: Enhancing Environmental Perception for the Visually Impaired through Vision-Language Models and Distance-Aware Object Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16488
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16488
- Reference count: 17
- Real-time assistive system achieving 45 ms inference latency on edge devices

## Executive Summary
VocalEyes is an assistive system designed to enhance environmental perception for visually impaired users through advanced vision-language models. The system processes live video input on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, providing real-time audio descriptions of surroundings including object identification and distance estimation. By leveraging a quantized and fine-tuned Florence-2 model, the system delivers spatially-aware descriptions that go beyond generic scene understanding, enabling safer navigation for visually impaired individuals.

The system incorporates a lightweight Parler TTS Mini component that offers customizable speech feedback with 34 voice options, ensuring accessibility and user preference accommodation. With object detection accuracy reaching 42.8 mAP and visual question answering performance at 68.4%, VocalEyes demonstrates strong technical capabilities while maintaining efficiency through model quantization that reduces size by 35% without significant performance loss.

## Method Summary
The VocalEyes system utilizes a quantized and fine-tuned Florence-2 model to process live video input from edge devices, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. The system employs object detection and distance estimation algorithms to provide spatially-aware environmental descriptions. A lightweight Parler TTS Mini component converts these descriptions into audio feedback with 34 customizable voice options. The fine-tuned model achieves 45 ms inference latency while maintaining performance comparable to larger models, enabling real-time assistive functionality for visually impaired users.

## Key Results
- Achieves 45 ms inference latency on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with 35% model size reduction
- Object detection accuracy of 42.8 mAP and visual question answering at 68.4%
- Provides spatially-aware environmental descriptions enabling safer navigation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages quantized vision-language models to achieve real-time performance on edge devices while maintaining accuracy. Fine-tuning on custom datasets enables domain-specific adaptation for visually impaired user needs. Distance-aware object detection provides critical spatial information beyond standard object identification, enhancing situational awareness for navigation tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-language models (VLMs): Bridge visual perception and language understanding, essential for describing visual scenes to visually impaired users. Quick check: Model must correctly identify and describe multiple objects in complex scenes.
- Model quantization: Reduces computational requirements and model size for edge deployment. Quick check: Latency should remain under 100ms while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
- Edge computing: Enables real-time processing without cloud dependency, critical for privacy and latency. Quick check: System must run continuously on target hardware without overheating or crashing.
- Distance estimation: Provides spatial context crucial for navigation safety. Quick check: Distance measurements should be accurate within 1-2 meters for objects 1-5 meters away.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Video Input -> Florence-2 Model -> Object Detection -> Distance Estimation -> Parler TTS Mini -> Audio Output

Critical path: Video capture → Model inference → Distance calculation → Text-to-speech conversion → Audio feedback

Design tradeoffs: Model quantization for speed vs. accuracy, edge deployment for privacy vs. computational limitations, lightweight TTS for efficiency vs. naturalness

Failure signatures: High latency indicating model overload, inaccurate distance estimation suggesting calibration issues, TTS failures indicating voice synthesis problems

First experiments: 1) Measure inference latency across different video resolutions, 2) Test object detection accuracy with varying lighting conditions, 3) Validate distance estimation accuracy at different ranges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in source material.

## Limitations
- Performance metrics may not generalize to complex real-world scenarios beyond tested environments
- Limited comparison to baseline non-quantized models under identical conditions
- User testing appears limited to technical metrics rather than comprehensive accessibility evaluations

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence:**
- Edge deployment feasibility with 45 ms latency: **High**
- Object detection accuracy (42.8 mAP): **Medium** (requires baseline comparison)
- System usability for visually impaired navigation: **Low** (limited user study data)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled user studies with visually impaired participants to validate system effectiveness in realistic navigation scenarios
2. Compare quantized Florence-2 performance against non-quantized baselines and alternative vision-language models under identical conditions
3. Test system robustness across diverse environmental conditions (lighting, weather, indoor/outdoor) and extended operational periods to assess performance stability
