# A Unified Frequency Domain Decomposition Framework for Interpretable and Robust Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.10145
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10145
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces FIRE, achieving 3-8% MSE improvements over state-of-the-art models on seven benchmark datasets

## Executive Summary
FIRE is a unified frequency domain decomposition framework for time series forecasting that addresses two key challenges: interpretability and robustness. The framework independently models amplitude and phase components, adaptively learns frequency basis weights via causal attention, and employs a composite loss function with targeted convergence objectives. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly under concept drift and basis evolution conditions.

## Method Summary
FIRE transforms time series into the frequency domain using FFT, then decomposes signals into amplitude and phase components. These components are processed through separate linear layers that capture inter-patch correlations, followed by causal attention on amplitude representations to adaptively track basis evolution. The framework reconstructs forecasts via iFFT after learning optimal basis weights. Training employs a composite loss combining Huber loss with hybrid convergence, frequency domain MAE, and phase regularization.

## Key Results
- FIRE achieves 3-8% MSE improvements and 2-7% MAE improvements over second-best model WPMixer across seven datasets
- FIRE shows 7-17.5% MSE improvements on challenging datasets with high concept drift and basis evolution
- Performance is particularly strong under concept drift and basis evolution, with consistent improvements across different forecast horizons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Frequency domain decomposition enables interpretable representation by transforming time series into orthogonal sinusoidal basis functions, decomposing complex signals into amplitude (energy/strength) and phase (timing) components that can be modeled independently.

### Mechanism 2
Independent amplitude/phase modeling captures concept drift more effectively than joint modeling by allowing the model to adapt to temporal distributional shifts that manifest differently in energy and timing components.

### Mechanism 3
Causal attention on amplitude representations adaptively tracks basis evolution by learning dynamic weights for frequency basis components across patches, allowing the model to focus on historically relevant bases while respecting temporal causality.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and complex number representation
  - Why needed: FIRE operates entirely in frequency domain; understanding how time-domain signals map to complex-valued frequency components is essential
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a real-valued time series produces complex-valued frequency components, and what the real/imaginary parts represent?

- **Concept**: Concept drift vs. basis evolution distinction
  - Why needed: These are the two core challenges FIRE addresses; understanding their different natures is critical for diagnosing model failures
  - Quick check: Given a time series where seasonal patterns strengthen over time, would this manifest primarily as concept drift or basis evolution?

- **Concept**: Strong vs. weak convergence in statistical learning
  - Why needed: The loss function explicitly balances these two convergence types; understanding the tradeoff helps interpret why Huber loss with hybrid weighting is used
  - Quick check: Why might weak convergence be preferable when training data is sparse or noisy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input pipeline → Frequency backbone → Output projection → Loss computation
- **Critical path**: The frequency domain backbone is where core innovations live - specifically the branching into amplitude/phase modeling (concept drift) and the recombination via causal attention (basis evolution)
- **Design tradeoffs**: FFT chosen for parameter-free universality over wavelets; causal masking preserves autoregressive validity but limits future context; fixed look-back window balances computational cost vs. historical context
- **Failure signatures**:
  1. NaN/Inf during complex-valued operations; diagnose with gradient clipping and magnitude checks
  2. No improvement over baseline; verify causal mask and full spectrum FFT loss computation
  3. Overfitting on small datasets; monitor train vs. validation gap; patch length >32 often worsens this
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Patch length sensitivity sweep (4, 8, 16, 32, 48) to find optimal granularity
  2. Look-back window ablation to verify context window benefits
  3. Component ablation (FIRE_base, FIRE_advanced, full FIRE) to quantify architectural contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can time series forecasting models overcome the saturation of performance gains to achieve continuous scalability similar to Foundation Models? The paper demonstrates diminishing returns with model capacity due to limited domain-specific data volume.
- **Open Question 2**: Does the use of more complex predicate functions in the hybrid convergence loss significantly improve robustness compared to the simplified single predicate? The authors use a single predicate for simplicity without analyzing alternative choices.
- **Open Question 3**: How can future frameworks move beyond empirical trial-and-error optimization to integrate more rigorous mathematical theory directly into the model architecture? While FIRE provides mathematical abstraction, optimization still relies on standard performance-based tuning.

## Limitations

- The FFT-based approach assumes data periodicity and may struggle with non-stationary signals containing sharp transients or discontinuities
- Several key hyperparameters (Huber loss threshold δ, phase regularization weight λ) are unspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Claims about interpretability benefits are primarily theoretical rather than demonstrated through user studies or visualization

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: FIRE's overall framework design, mathematical foundations (DFT/FFT operations), and general superiority over baselines
- **Medium confidence**: The amplitude/phase separation's effectiveness for concept drift handling lacks ablation studies isolating this effect
- **Medium confidence**: Basis evolution tracking via causal attention is validated empirically but generalizability to irregular patterns needs testing
- **Low confidence**: Interpretability benefits are theoretical rather than empirically demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on concept drift types**: Create synthetic datasets with controlled amplitude-only, phase-only, and coupled drift patterns to isolate the contribution of separate amplitude/phase modeling
2. **Irregular basis evolution test**: Evaluate FIRE on datasets with artificially injected non-smooth basis evolution to test causal attention robustness
3. **Real-time streaming validation**: Implement online training protocol to verify FIRE's claimed robustness to concept drift in continuous data streams with incremental model updates
