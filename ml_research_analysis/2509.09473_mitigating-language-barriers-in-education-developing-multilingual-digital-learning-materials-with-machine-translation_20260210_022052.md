# Mitigating Language Barriers in Education: Developing Multilingual Digital Learning Materials with Machine Translation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.09473
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09473
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Adapted MT system achieved chrF 63.1 and human eval 7.80/10 for Czech→Ukrainian educational content

## Executive Summary
The EdUKate project addresses language barriers in Czech education by translating 9,000 interactive exercises from Czech into Ukrainian, English, and German using machine translation. The project developed a domain-adapted Czech-Ukrainian MT system specifically for educational content, incorporating formatted text processing and specialized terminology handling. A survey of Czech teachers revealed that 71% of non-Czech-speaking students attend Czech lessons instead of other subjects, and 83% of schools offer Czech language lessons for foreigners. The best-adapted MT system achieved an average human evaluation score of 7.80/10, with automatic chrF score of 63.1. Qualitative analysis identified terminology as the primary challenge, particularly in biology and natural sciences. Pilot testing with teachers confirmed the usability and functionality of translated exercises, though improvements are needed in translation accuracy and device responsiveness. All resulting applications will be freely available to educators and researchers.

## Method Summary
The project translated 9,000 interactive educational exercises from Czech into Ukrainian using a domain-adapted neural machine translation system. The methodology involved adapting the Charles Translator (a CUBBITT-derived model) with educational domain data through translationese tuning and additional training data, implementing formatted text handling for XML/HTML exercise structures, and conducting pilot testing with Czech teachers. Evaluation used both automatic chrF scoring and human assessment by native Ukrainian speakers on a subset of 1,600 segments, alongside qualitative error analysis across lexical, morphological, and syntactic categories.

## Key Results
- Domain-adapted MT system achieved chrF score of 63.1 (up from 61.6) and human evaluation of 7.80/10 (up from 7.41/10)
- Terminology mistranslation identified as primary challenge, especially in biology and natural sciences
- 71% of non-Czech-speaking students attend Czech lessons instead of other subjects, highlighting need for translated materials
- Teachers found toggle-based language switching more useful than side-by-side display, though device responsiveness needs improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain-adapted machine translation improves educational content quality over general-purpose systems.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning on in-domain educational materials (biology, chemistry, geography exercises) allows the model to learn subject-specific terminology patterns and classroom language registers. The adapted system uses "translationese tuning" and additional monolingual/parallel training data.
- Core assumption: Educational domain has sufficiently distinct vocabulary and phrasing patterns that differ from general news or web text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The best-adapted MT system achieved an average human evaluation score of 7.80/10, with automatic chrF score of 63.1"
  - [section 3.1]: "Adapted CHT 2024... showed improvements in both the automatic chrF score (61.6→63.1) and human evaluation (7.41→7.80)"
  - [corpus]: Weak—no directly comparable educational MT adaptation studies in neighbors.
- Break condition: If terminology error rate exceeds ~15-20% of segments (assumption: based on 3.2.1 analysis showing terminology as "primary challenge"), pedagogical utility degrades sharply.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Direct Czech-Ukrainian translation reduces grammatical error categories compared to pivot-via-English approaches.
- Mechanism: Skipping an intermediate English translation step eliminates error propagation from two sequential translation operations, particularly for grammatical categories where Czech-Ukrainian share structural similarities that English lacks (case systems, aspect distinctions).
- Core assumption: Direct translation captures linguistic commonalities between Slavic languages that would be lost through Germanic-language pivot.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2.2]: "Unlike common commercial translators that pivot the translation over English, Charles Translator translates directly and is thus not prone to some types of errors, especially in certain grammatical categories"
  - [section 3.2.1]: "Morphological errors (e.g., incorrect case, number, or gender) were less frequent and typically did not impede understanding"
  - [corpus]: Not directly addressed in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If training data for direct language pair falls below critical threshold (assumption: likely millions of sentence pairs needed), pivot approach may become superior.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Language-switching functionality in exercises supports comprehension without replacing L2 learning.
- Mechanism: Toggle-based interface allows students to reference native-language translations of specific segments while maintaining engagement with target language content. This scaffolds understanding without eliminating exposure to Czech.
- Core assumption: Students benefit from selective native-language support rather than full immersion or full translation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "respondents understood how to switch between languages and they found the possibility to toggle between the two languages during completing the exercises more useful than to display both languages at once, side by side"
  - [section 2.2.1]: "71% of pupils attend Czech lessons instead of a different school subject" indicating need for content-area support in Czech
  - [corpus]: Partial support from "Multilingual Performance Biases of LLMs in Education" regarding language-specific educational needs.
- Break condition: If toggle is used for >70% of exercise content (assumption), learning benefit diminishes toward passive consumption.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **chrF (character n-gram F-score)**
  - Why needed here: Primary automatic evaluation metric cited; correlates with but doesn't fully capture human-perceived translation quality.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why chrF (character-level) might outperform BLEU (token-level) for morphologically rich languages like Czech and Ukrainian?

- Concept: **Neural MT domain adaptation**
  - Why needed here: Core technical approach; distinguishes project from off-the-shelf translation APIs.
  - Quick check question: What minimum volume of in-domain parallel data would you expect to need before fine-tuning shows measurable gains? (Paper doesn't specify training corpus sizes.)

- Concept: **Formatted text handling in MT pipelines**
  - Why needed here: Educational exercises contain XML/HTML markup; mishandled tags break interactive functionality.
  - Quick check question: Why can't you simply strip formatting, translate, and re-insert tags positionally? What linguistic phenomena break this approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - **Charles Translator core**: Transformer-based NMT model (architecture: CUBBITT-derived with Block Backtranslation)
  - **Domain adaptation layer**: Fine-tuned checkpoint for educational content
  - **Format preservation module**: Word alignment tool for tag placement in XML/HTML
  - **API server**: Fraus-specific endpoint for batch exercise translation
  - **Web portal**: Škola s nadhledem frontend with language toggle UI
  - **Evaluation pipeline**: chrF scoring + human annotation interface (0-10 scale)

- Critical path:
  1. Curate human-translated dev/test sets (396 exercises: 190 dev, 206 test)
  2. Adapt MT model with in-domain data + translationese tuning
  3. Integrate format preservation for exercise XML structures
  4. Deploy API endpoint for publisher integration
  5. Pilot with 7+ educators; collect qualitative feedback
  6. Iterate on terminology handling (identified as primary failure mode)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Direct vs. pivot translation**: Lower latency and fewer errors for Czech-Ukrainian, but requires maintaining separate model per language pair (English, German additions planned by 2026)
  - **Toggle UI vs. side-by-side**: Toggle preferred by teachers (less visual clutter), but requires extra click per consultation
  - **Free API access vs. commercial licensing**: Enables educational use but limits sustainability model

- Failure signatures:
  - **Terminology hallucination**: Specialized terms (e.g., "ponravy" = scarab beetle larvae) translated incorrectly or to wrong concepts; detected via human evaluation
  - **Format tag corruption**: Broken exercise interactivity after translation; detectable via automated XML validation
  - **Device responsiveness gaps**: UI fails on mobile/interactive whiteboards; requires manual QA across device classes

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Terminology injection test**: Extract 50 biology/chemistry terms from exercises; evaluate translation accuracy before/after augmenting training data with external terminological resources (paper mentions this as ongoing work).
  2. **Format preservation validation**: Translate 100 XML-formatted exercises; validate tag structure preservation rate. Target: >98% valid output.
  3. **User toggle frequency analysis**: Instrument pilot portal to log language-switch events per exercise. Hypothesis: Higher toggle frequency correlates with lower prior Czech proficiency; use to inform exercise difficulty routing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can large language model (LLM)-based translation methods outperform the current domain-adapted neural MT system (Adapted CHT 2024) in handling formatted educational content?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they are "experimenting with the latest LLM-based methods to see if translation quality can be further improved."
- Why unresolved: The paper presents results only for the current neural system; LLM experimentation is listed as ongoing work without reported metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative automatic (chrF) and human evaluation scores between the LLM outputs and the Adapted CHT 2024 baseline on the same test set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does enriching training data with external terminological sources reduce lexical errors in natural science exercises?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify terminology as the primary challenge (especially in biology) and state they are "implementing specific methods (e.g. adding external terminological sources) to eliminate this issue."
- Why unresolved: The error analysis confirms the problem (mistranslation of specific terms), but the proposed solution is currently being implemented and not yet evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: A follow-up qualitative error analysis measuring the reduction in lexical errors for subjects like biology and chemistry after the integration of external terminology.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the availability of translated digital learning materials enable non-Czech-speaking students to participate in standard subject lessons rather than substituting them with Czech language instruction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The survey notes that 71% of non-Czech-speaking students attend Czech lessons *instead* of other subjects; the project aims to mitigate language barriers, implying a goal to reverse this substitution.
- Why unresolved: The pilot test focused on the usability and functionality of the portal, not on the broader pedagogical impact on student attendance or integration in mixed classrooms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal monitoring of student participation rates in subject-specific lessons (e.g., geography, biology) before and after the deployment of the translated exercises.

## Limitations
- Data availability constraints: The paper does not specify the volume or sources of additional monolingual and parallel training data used for domain adaptation, making it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the reported improvements or to reproduce the exact methodology.
- Terminology handling gaps: While the paper identifies terminology as the primary challenge, it does not provide concrete metrics for terminology error rates or describe the specific strategies being implemented to address this issue.
- Long-term sustainability questions: The free API access model raises questions about maintenance and updates beyond the initial project timeline, particularly as language pairs expand to include English and German.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The reported improvement in MT quality (chrF 61.6→63.1, human eval 7.41→7.80) is well-supported by the evaluation methodology and the domain adaptation approach is technically sound.
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the toggle-based UI for supporting comprehension without replacing L2 learning is supported by teacher feedback but lacks direct student learning outcome data.
- Low confidence: The claim that direct Czech-Ukrainian translation reduces grammatical errors compared to pivot approaches is supported by limited qualitative evidence and would benefit from more systematic error category analysis.

## Next Checks
1. **Terminology error rate quantification**: Extract and evaluate 100 specialized terms from biology and natural science exercises to establish baseline terminology error rates before implementing the proposed external terminological resources.
2. **Cross-device functionality testing**: Conduct systematic testing across 5+ device types (desktop, tablet, interactive whiteboard, smartphone, e-reader) to quantify the scope of responsiveness issues and establish device-specific UI requirements.
3. **Learning outcome correlation study**: Design a controlled study comparing student performance on exercises with toggle functionality versus static translations to measure the actual impact on Czech language acquisition and subject comprehension.
