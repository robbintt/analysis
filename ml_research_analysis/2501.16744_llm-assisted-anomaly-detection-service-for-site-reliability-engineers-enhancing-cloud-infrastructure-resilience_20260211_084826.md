# LLM Assisted Anomaly Detection Service for Site Reliability Engineers: Enhancing Cloud Infrastructure Resilience

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.16744
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16744
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: LLM-assisted anomaly detection service deployed with 500+ users and 200K+ API calls, achieving F1 scores of 0.947-0.985 on public datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an innovative anomaly detection service that integrates pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with traditional anomaly detection algorithms to enhance cloud infrastructure resilience. The service systematically identifies failure modes, relevant metrics, and anomalous behaviors for cloud components, enabling proactive issue identification and reducing downtime. With practical deployment metrics showing 500+ users and 200,000+ API calls within a year, the system demonstrates both technical effectiveness and operational adoption. The approach combines scalable API infrastructure with diverse detection algorithms (regression-based, mixture-model-based, semi-supervised) while leveraging LLM capabilities for intelligent failure mode analysis.

## Method Summary
The proposed system employs a dual approach combining traditional anomaly detection algorithms with LLM assistance for comprehensive infrastructure monitoring. The core methodology utilizes regression-based, mixture-model-based, and semi-supervised detection algorithms to identify anomalies across cloud metrics, while pre-trained LLMs systematically analyze infrastructure components to identify potential failure modes and relevant monitoring metrics. The service architecture is designed for scalability with an API-first approach, allowing integration into existing SRE workflows. The LLM component provides intelligent analysis of component behaviors and failure patterns, complementing the statistical detection algorithms to improve overall accuracy and reduce false positives in complex cloud environments.

## Key Results
- Competitive F1 scores of 0.947-0.985 on public datasets (SMD, MSL, SMAP) compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Practical deployment with over 500 users and 200,000 API calls within one year
- Demonstrated capability to reduce downtime and improve incident response times through proactive anomaly detection
- Integration of LLM assistance shows promise for intelligent failure mode identification in complex cloud infrastructure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from the complementary integration of statistical anomaly detection algorithms with LLM-based intelligent analysis. Traditional algorithms provide robust mathematical detection of metric deviations, while LLMs offer contextual understanding of infrastructure components, failure patterns, and relationships between metrics. This combination enables the system to not only detect anomalies but also understand their potential impact and root causes within the broader infrastructure context. The LLM component systematically identifies failure modes and relevant metrics that might be missed by purely statistical approaches, while the underlying detection algorithms provide the mathematical rigor needed for accurate anomaly identification across diverse metric types and distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM Analysis Engine -> Anomaly Detection Algorithms -> API Gateway -> User Interface

**Critical Path**: Data Ingestion -> LLM Failure Mode Analysis -> Statistical Anomaly Detection -> Result Aggregation -> API Response

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture balances computational efficiency with analytical depth by using lightweight statistical algorithms for real-time detection while offloading complex contextual analysis to LLMs. This design prioritizes scalability and integration ease over computational complexity, accepting some latency in LLM-based analysis to maintain overall system responsiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: The system identifies specific failure patterns including metric spikes, gradual degradation, periodic anomalies, and cross-component correlation breaks. These signatures are used both for training the detection algorithms and for LLM analysis of failure modes.

**First Experiments**:
1. Deploy the service on a controlled test environment with synthetic anomalies to validate detection accuracy and false positive rates
2. Conduct A/B testing comparing LLM-assisted detection against baseline statistical methods using identical infrastructure metrics
3. Perform stress testing by simulating high-volume API calls to evaluate system scalability and response time under load
