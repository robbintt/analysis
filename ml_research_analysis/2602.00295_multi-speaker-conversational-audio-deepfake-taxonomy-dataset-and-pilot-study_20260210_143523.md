# Multi-Speaker Conversational Audio Deepfake: Taxonomy, Dataset and Pilot Study

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2602.00295
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00295
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces MsCADD dataset with 2,830 audio clips for multi-speaker conversational audio deepfake detection

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the emerging threat of multi-speaker conversational audio deepfakes, which are currently understudied compared to single-speaker scenarios. The authors propose a taxonomy for multi-speaker deepfakes, distinguishing between partial manipulations (one or multiple speakers altered) and full manipulations (entire conversations synthesized). They introduce the Multi-speaker Conversational Audio Deepfakes Dataset (MsCADD), consisting of 2,830 audio clips of real and fully synthetic two-speaker conversations. The dataset was generated using VITS and SoundStorm-based NotebookLM models to simulate natural dialogue with variations in speaker gender and conversational spontaneity. The authors benchmark three neural baseline models (LFCC-LCNN, RawNet2, and Wav2Vec 2.0) on this dataset, reporting performance metrics including F1 score, accuracy, true positive rate (TPR), and true negative rate (TNR). Results show that while baseline models demonstrate some ability to distinguish real from synthetic conversations, there remains a significant gap in reliably detecting synthetic voices under varied conversational dynamics. The MsCADD dataset is publicly available to support further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a comprehensive taxonomy for multi-speaker conversational deepfakes, categorizing them into partial manipulations (where one or multiple speakers are altered) and full manipulations (where entire conversations are synthesized). They created the MsCADD dataset using VITS and SoundStorm-based NotebookLM models to generate 2,830 audio clips of two-speaker conversations. The synthetic conversations were designed to capture natural dialogue patterns with variations in speaker gender and conversational spontaneity. Three neural baseline models (LFCC-LCNN, RawNet2, and Wav2Vec 2.0) were benchmarked on this dataset using standard performance metrics including F1 score, accuracy, true positive rate, and true negative rate.

## Key Results
- Introduced the first taxonomy for multi-speaker conversational audio deepfakes, distinguishing partial from full manipulations
- Created MsCADD dataset with 2,830 audio clips of real and fully synthetic two-speaker conversations
- Baseline models achieved measurable but imperfect performance, indicating significant room for improvement in multi-speaker deepfake detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by establishing a structured framework for understanding multi-speaker deepfake scenarios and creating a benchmark dataset that captures the unique challenges of conversational dynamics. By generating synthetic conversations that mimic natural dialogue patterns, the dataset reveals vulnerabilities in current detection systems when dealing with conversational audio rather than isolated utterances. The taxonomy provides a systematic way to categorize and study different types of multi-speaker manipulations, enabling more targeted research approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-speaker deepfake taxonomy**: Understanding different manipulation types (partial vs. full) is essential for developing targeted detection strategies and evaluating threat levels
- **Conversational audio characteristics**: Natural dialogue involves turn-taking, overlaps, and emotional dynamics that create unique patterns difficult to synthesize perfectly
- **TTS synthesis limitations**: Current text-to-speech models like VITS and SoundStorm can generate natural-sounding speech but may struggle with maintaining consistency across extended conversational contexts
- **Baseline model architectures**: LFCC-LCNN, RawNet2, and Wav2Vec 2.0 represent different approaches to audio feature extraction and classification, providing diverse detection perspectives
- **Dataset size considerations**: 2,830 samples provide initial benchmarking capability but may limit generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios
- **Performance metrics for audio deepfakes**: F1 score, accuracy, TPR, and TNR provide complementary views of detection capability and false positive/negative rates

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset Generation -> Model Training -> Performance Evaluation -> Taxonomy Application

**Critical Path**: Synthetic audio generation using NotebookLM → Feature extraction by baseline models → Classification decision → Performance metric calculation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The dataset prioritizes conversational realism over diversity of manipulation types, potentially limiting detection of more sophisticated partial manipulation attacks

**Failure Signatures**: Detection models show decreased performance on synthetic conversations with rapid speaker turns and emotional content, indicating vulnerabilities in handling dynamic conversational patterns

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test baseline models on expanded dataset with multi-party conversations (3+ speakers)
2. Evaluate detection performance against deepfakes generated by alternative TTS systems beyond NotebookLM
3. Conduct adversarial testing with controlled perturbations to identify specific vulnerabilities in current detection approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 2,830 audio clips may limit generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios
- Focus on two-speaker conversations excludes the complexity of multi-party interactions
- NotebookLM-based synthetic generation may not represent the full diversity of real-world deepfake generation techniques

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The taxonomy framework for multi-speaker deepfakes is well-founded and provides clear categorization that aligns with existing deepfake research paradigms

**Medium confidence**: Baseline model performance metrics are reliable for the specific dataset but may not generalize to all deepfake detection scenarios

**Medium confidence**: The synthetic generation methodology produces natural conversations but may not capture all real-world variations in conversational dynamics

## Next Checks
1. Test baseline models on an expanded dataset with more diverse conversational scenarios, including multi-party conversations and different acoustic environments
2. Evaluate model performance against deepfakes generated by alternative TTS systems beyond NotebookLM to assess robustness
3. Conduct adversarial testing with controlled perturbations to identify specific vulnerabilities in current detection approaches
