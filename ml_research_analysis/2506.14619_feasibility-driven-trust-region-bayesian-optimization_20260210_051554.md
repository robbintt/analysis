## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14619

- Primary result: FuRBO consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines in constrained black-box optimization, particularly in high-dimensional problems with narrow feasible regions

## Executive Summary
Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) addresses constrained black-box optimization problems where finding any feasible solution is difficult, particularly in high-dimensional settings with narrow feasible regions. FuRBO builds on SCBO's trust region framework but redefines the trust region using feasibility-aware ranking of inspector samples sampled around the current best solution. This allows FuRBO to dynamically adapt the trust region's location and size based on global surrogate information about both objective and constraints, accelerating convergence and improving exploitation of narrow feasible regions.

## Method Summary
FuRBO modifies the trust region Bayesian optimization framework by introducing a feasibility-aware ranking mechanism for inspector samples. Instead of using a fixed or geometrically-defined trust region, FuRBO samples inspector points around the current best solution and ranks them based on both objective and constraint predictions from surrogate models. The trust region is then redefined around the highest-ranked inspector sample, allowing dynamic adaptation of both location and size. This approach leverages global surrogate information to more effectively navigate narrow feasible regions and improve convergence speed in constrained optimization problems.

## Key Results
- FuRBO consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines on BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite
- Statistically significant improvements observed in 10D and 40D problems with tight or complex constraints
- Superior performance demonstrated on physics-inspired problems with narrow feasible regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FuRBO works by addressing the fundamental challenge in constrained optimization where traditional trust region methods can get stuck exploring infeasible regions. By using feasibility-aware ranking of inspector samples, FuRBO can dynamically shift the trust region to more promising areas based on global surrogate predictions. This mechanism allows the algorithm to better exploit narrow feasible regions by considering both objective and constraint information simultaneously, rather than treating feasibility as a separate filtering step.

## Foundational Learning
- Trust region Bayesian optimization: why needed - to limit exploration to promising regions and improve convergence; quick check - verify that trust regions properly contract/expand based on surrogate uncertainty
- Feasibility-aware ranking: why needed - to incorporate constraint information into the selection of promising regions; quick check - ensure ranking properly balances objective improvement and constraint satisfaction
- Inspector sampling: why needed - to gather global information about the search space; quick check - verify inspector samples adequately cover the trust region

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Surrogate Models -> Inspector Sampling -> Feasibility-Aware Ranking -> Trust Region Redefinition -> Acquisition Function

**Critical Path:** The critical path involves generating inspector samples, ranking them using surrogate predictions, redefining the trust region around the highest-ranked sample, and then using this updated trust region for acquisition function optimization.

**Design Tradeoffs:** FuRBO trades computational overhead from generating and ranking inspector samples against improved convergence in narrow feasible regions. The method also trades the simplicity of fixed trust regions for the complexity of dynamic, feasibility-driven adaptation.

**Failure Signatures:** Potential failures include: poor surrogate model predictions leading to incorrect trust region placement, excessive computational cost from inspector sampling in high dimensions, and failure to escape local optima when the feasible region is highly non-convex.

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify that inspector sampling adequately covers the trust region in various dimensionalities
2. Test the sensitivity of FuRBO's performance to the number of inspector samples
3. Compare FuRBO's convergence behavior against SCBO on problems with known narrow feasible regions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on surrogate models that may not perform well with extremely narrow or highly non-linear feasible regions
- Computational overhead from generating and ranking inspector samples, particularly in very high-dimensional spaces
- Limited exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity, including inspector sample count and ranking schemes

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Theoretical framework is well-founded | High |
| Experimental results are promising | Medium |
| Statistically significant improvements are demonstrated | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test FuRBO on a broader range of constrained optimization problems, including those with discontinuous or non-convex feasible regions
2. Conduct systematic study on sensitivity to hyperparameters like inspector sample count and ranking scheme
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability in very high-dimensional spaces (100D or higher)
