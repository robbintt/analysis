# Beyond Naïve Prompting: Strategies for Improved Zero-shot Context-aided Forecasting with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2508.09904
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09904
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Four novel prompting strategies (ReDP, CorDP, IC-DP, RouteDP) improve zero-shot context-aided forecasting accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency across multiple LLM families on the CiK benchmark.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of zero-shot context-aided forecasting with LLMs, where models must incorporate both historical numerical data and textual context to produce probabilistic forecasts. The authors introduce four strategies that go beyond naive direct prompting: ReDP (explicit reasoning traces), CorDP (correcting existing forecasts), IC-DP (in-context examples), and RouteDP (difficulty-based task routing). Evaluated on the CiK benchmark across 71 tasks and 7 domains, these methods demonstrate significant improvements in forecast accuracy, interpretability, and resource efficiency compared to standard prompting approaches.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces four zero-shot prompting strategies for context-aided forecasting. Direct Prompting (DP) serves as the baseline, where LLMs directly generate forecasts from context and history. ReDP adds reasoning traces to separate semantic understanding from numerical application. CorDP leverages LLMs to correct forecasts from specialized quantitative models. IC-DP uses in-context learning by including one historical example in the prompt. RouteDP employs a small LLM to predict task difficulty and routes challenging tasks to larger models. All methods use structured XML-style output tags and are evaluated on the CiK benchmark using Region-of-Interest CRPS (RCRPS) as the primary metric.

## Key Results
- ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, enabling independent assessment of reasoning versus forecast accuracy
- CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts with context, enhancing integration with existing forecasting pipelines
- IC-DP significantly improves accuracy by including one historical example in the prompt, at the cost of increased token usage
- RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by routing challenging tasks to larger models, achieving 3-5x cost savings while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Reasoning-Application Separation (ReDP)
- **Claim:** Explicit reasoning traces allow for the independent diagnosis of a model's ability to interpret context versus its ability to apply that interpretation to numerical outputs.
- **Mechanism:** By forcing the LLM to generate a reasoning trace inside `<reason>` tags before the forecast, the system decouples the semantic understanding of the context from the numerical generation. This exposes a specific failure mode where a model may reason correctly but fail to apply that reasoning to the final forecast.
- **Core assumption:** The generated reasoning trace is a faithful representation of the model's internal logic (a "Verbalized Belief").
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract], [section 4.2], [corpus] neighbors discuss reasoning approaches but don't validate ReDP diagnostic claim specifically.

### Mechanism 2: Forecast Bootstrapping (CorDP)
- **Claim:** Utilizing LLMs as correctors of existing quantitative forecasts allows for better integration of textual context than using the LLM as a primary forecaster from scratch.
- **Mechanism:** CorDP provides a strong numerical prior from models like Lag-Llama or ARIMA. The LLM is then tasked only with "judgmental correction"—adjusting the distribution based on the text. This leverages the LLM's strength in language understanding while offloading the heavy lifting of time-series pattern recognition to the specialized base model.
- **Core assumption:** The base quantitative forecaster provides a reasonable probability distribution that can be locally adjusted by the LLM without destroying the underlying temporal dynamics.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract], [section 5.2], [corpus] [36658] warns that noise can break LLM forecasters, supporting the strategy of using robust quant models as the base.

### Mechanism 3: Difficulty-Based Routing (RouteDP)
- **Claim:** A small LLM can effectively predict the difficulty of a forecasting task zero-shot, enabling efficient resource allocation to larger models only when necessary.
- **Mechanism:** A "Router" LLM is prompted to score task difficulty (0-1). Tasks are ranked, and only the top-k "hardest" tasks are sent to a large, expensive model (Llama-405B), while the rest use a small model. This relies on the small model's ability to recognize complexity even if it cannot solve it.
- **Core assumption:** Task difficulty is a transferrable concept where a model's self-assessed uncertainty or perceived complexity correlates with the actual performance gap between small and large models.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract], [section 7.3], [corpus] Evidence for routing in zero-shot forecasting is not present in the provided corpus neighbors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Context-Aided Forecasting**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the core problem formulation. Unlike standard forecasting, the model must ingest both historical numerical data (XH) and textual context (C) to estimate the conditional distribution P(XF | XH, C).
  - **Quick check question:** Does your current system ingest unstructured text (e.g., "Building closed for maintenance") alongside the time series history?

- **Concept: Region-of-Interest (RoI) & RCRPS**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard metrics (MSE/MAE) fail here because context often only affects specific windows (e.g., a 2-hour heatwave) or imposes hard constraints (values < 0). RCRPS prioritizes these sensitive regions.
  - **Quick check question:** Are you evaluating your model's performance only on the aggregate error, or specifically on the timesteps where the context is active?

- **Concept: In-Context Learning (ICL)**
  - **Why needed here:** IC-DP relies on ICL. The paper assumes that providing a single historical example of how context affects a forecast can "teach" the model to apply similar logic to the current task without weight updates.
  - **Quick check question:** Can your system retrieve historical analogies (similar context events) to include in the prompt?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Tokenizer for Text (Context) + Numerical Serializer for History -> Strategy Layer (ReDP, CorDP, IC-DP, RouteDP modules) -> Generation Layer (Target LLM) -> Output Parser (extracts <reason> and <forecast> tags)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Receive History + Context
  2. (Optional - RouteDP) Route to Small or Large model based on difficulty prediction
  3. (Optional - CorDP) Generate base forecast from statistical model
  4. Construct Prompt (incorporating Context, History, Base Forecast if CorDP, Examples if IC-DP)
  5. LLM Generation
  6. Parse Forecast (and Reasoning if ReDP)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **CorDP vs. DP:** CorDP is safer if you have a strong quantitative model but adds latency (2-step process). DP is faster but relies entirely on the LLM's numerical capabilities.
  - **IC-DP vs. DP:** IC-DP significantly boosts accuracy but doubles/triples input token count (and cost/latency) due to the in-context example.
  - **RouteDP:** Optimizes cost vs. accuracy. Requires maintaining two model endpoints (Small and Large).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **ReDP:** "Correct Reasoning, No Improvement" (Table 1). The model explains the context perfectly but outputs the wrong numbers.
  - **CorDP:** "Base Forecast Degradation" (Table 2). Small LLMs (e.g., 0.5B) sometimes make the base forecast worse by "correcting" it with noise.
  - **RouteDP:** "Random Performance." The router fails to distinguish difficulty, behaving like a coin flip.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline DP:** Run a standard LLM (e.g., Llama-3-8B) on a subset of the CiK benchmark using only Direct Prompting to establish a floor.
  2. **CorDP Test:** Switch to CorDP. Run a statistical model (ARIMA) to generate a base, then prompt the same LLM to "correct" it based on context. Check if RCRPS improves in the Region of Interest.
  3. **IC-DP Validation:** Add a single historical example (from the dataset, not the test set) to the prompt. Verify if the RCRPS drops significantly (as suggested by Figure 2/3).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is confined to the CiK benchmark (71 tasks across 7 domains), which may not capture the full spectrum of real-world forecasting scenarios
- CorDP shows clear benefits for large models but can degrade performance for smaller models (0.5B), raising questions about universal applicability
- While ReDP claims to separate reasoning from application, the paper acknowledges that generated reasoning traces may not always reflect true causal reasoning

## Confidence
**High Confidence (3-4):**
- Direct Prompting (DP) as baseline effectiveness: Consistently validated across model families and sizes
- RouteDP efficiency gains: Clear evidence of cost savings (3-5x) while maintaining comparable performance
- IC-DP accuracy improvements: Statistically significant RCRPS reductions are well-documented

**Medium Confidence (2-3):**
- ReDP interpretability benefits: Supported by qualitative analysis but lacks rigorous validation of reasoning-trace faithfulness
- CorDP integration advantages: Strong results for large models, but inconsistent performance for smaller models raises concerns
- Cross-model generalization: Results show promise across Llama and Qwen families, but broader model diversity testing is needed

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the four strategies on at least one additional forecasting benchmark (e.g., M4 competition data or real-world IoT sensor data) to assess generalizability beyond CiK

2. **Multi-task routing optimization**: Implement a more sophisticated router that considers not just difficulty but also model-specific strengths across different domains, then compare routing efficiency against the current binary approach

3. **Long-term forecasting stress test**: Evaluate strategy performance on forecasting tasks with time horizons beyond the current CiK benchmark (e.g., 30+ days) to identify potential degradation patterns or context-window limitations
