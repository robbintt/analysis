# Cross Domain Evaluation of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of different datasets into the Amazon CoT Framework

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.20701
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20701
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Primary result**: Evaluates MM-CoT framework across ScienceQA, ChartQA, OK-VQA, and A-OKVQA, showing domain-specific performance variations from 90.45% to 14.30% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MM-CoT) reasoning across three diverse datasets beyond its original ScienceQA benchmark. The authors implement a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation from answer inference, adapting MM-CoT for ChartQA, OK-VQA, and A-OKVQA, each requiring different reasoning skills including numerical, commonsense, and world knowledge reasoning. Systematic ablation studies reveal that while vision integration reduces hallucination in rationale generation, performance varies substantially across domains, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges.

The findings demonstrate that MM-CoT's effectiveness is highly dependent on question type and domain characteristics, with accuracy dropping from 90.45% on ScienceQA to 14.30%, 21.31%, and 32% respectively on the other datasets. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for improving cross-domain generalization, particularly the need for better visual encoders and reasoning strategies beyond scientific contexts.

## Method Summary
The authors adapt Amazon's MM-CoT framework for cross-domain evaluation using a two-stage approach: rationale generation followed by answer inference. They implement Vision Language Models (VLMs) with multimodal attention mechanisms to process visual inputs alongside text, using a dual-stage reasoning pipeline where the model first generates step-by-step reasoning chains before producing final answers. The framework is evaluated on ChartQA (numerical reasoning with charts), OK-VQA and A-OKVQA (commonsense and world knowledge reasoning with images), with systematic ablation studies comparing performance with and without visual input integration.

## Key Results
- MM-CoT achieves 90.45% accuracy on ScienceQA but drops to 14.30% on ChartQA, 21.31% on OK-VQA, and 32% on A-OKVQA
- Vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation across all datasets
- Commonsense reasoning tasks show substantially lower performance compared to structured scientific reasoning
- Numerical reasoning with charts performs worst among evaluated datasets despite visual support

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage architecture separates complex multimodal reasoning into manageable subtasks, allowing the model to first construct a reasoning chain before committing to a final answer. This decomposition reduces cognitive load and provides intermediate checkpoints for error detection. Vision integration through VLMs enables grounding of textual reasoning in visual evidence, reducing hallucinations by forcing the model to reference specific visual elements during chain-of-thought generation.

## Foundational Learning
**Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MM-CoT)**: Sequential reasoning approach that combines visual and textual inputs to generate intermediate reasoning steps before final answers. Needed because single-step multimodal reasoning often fails on complex tasks; check by verifying step-by-step rationale quality.

**Vision Language Models (VLMs)**: Models that process both visual and textual inputs using multimodal attention mechanisms. Needed to bridge visual understanding with language reasoning; check by testing visual question answering performance.

**Dual-Stage Reasoning Pipeline**: Architecture separating rationale generation from answer inference. Needed to isolate reasoning quality from final answer confidence; check by comparing intermediate rationale accuracy to final answer accuracy.

**Ablation Studies**: Experimental approach removing components to measure their individual contributions. Needed to understand which elements drive performance; check by ensuring each ablation provides interpretable insights.

**Domain Generalization**: Model's ability to perform across different types of visual reasoning tasks. Needed to assess framework robustness beyond training domains; check by testing on diverse, unseen dataset types.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Visual Data -> VLM Encoder -> Multimodal Attention -> Rationale Generator -> Answer Inferencer -> Final Answer

**Critical Path**: Visual input processing through VLM → Multimodal attention fusion → Rationale generation → Answer inference → Final output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The two-stage approach trades computational efficiency for improved reasoning accuracy and reduced hallucinations. Single-stage approaches would be faster but show higher hallucination rates and lower accuracy on complex reasoning tasks.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance drops on commonsense reasoning indicate limitations in world knowledge integration; poor ChartQA performance suggests visual encoder limitations for numerical data extraction; high hallucination rates without vision integration reveal over-reliance on textual priors.

**First Experiments**: 1) Run baseline MM-CoT on each dataset to establish performance floor, 2) Enable vision integration and measure hallucination reduction, 3) Perform ablation by removing rationale generation stage to quantify its contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the significant performance degradation across domains suggests several implicit research directions: how to improve commonsense reasoning in multimodal contexts, whether visual encoder architecture or reasoning strategy is the primary bottleneck, and what training approaches could enable better cross-domain generalization.

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation limited to four datasets, all single-domain visual reasoning tasks
- Framework may be overfitted to scientific reasoning contexts based on large performance gaps
- Does not explore alternative visual encoder architectures or their impact on performance
- Attribution of performance differences to reasoning skill types lacks systematic validation

## Confidence
- **High**: Framework architecture design and implementation details are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium**: Quantitative performance metrics are reliable but may shift with different visual encoders or CoT prompting strategies
- **Low**: Attribution of performance differences to specific reasoning skill types lacks systematic validation

## Next Checks
1. Test MM-CoT framework on a more diverse multimodal dataset (e.g., VQA-X, GQA, or DocVQA) to assess generalization beyond single-domain visual reasoning
2. Implement and compare alternative visual encoder architectures (CLIP variants, SigLIP, or region-based models) to isolate whether performance drops are due to visual processing limitations
3. Design controlled experiments varying reasoning complexity while holding visual content constant to determine whether performance degradation stems from commonsense reasoning difficulty or visual understanding gaps
