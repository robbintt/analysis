# SciLaD: A Large-Scale, Transparent, Reproducible Dataset for Natural Scientific Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11192
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11192
- Authors: Luca Foppiano; Sotaro Takeshita; Pedro Ortiz Suarez; Ekaterina Borisova; Raia Abu Ahmad; Malte Ostendorff; Fabio Barth; Julian Moreno-Schneider; Georg Rehm
- Reference count: 0
- Dataset of 35M+ multilingual publications with 10M English documents for scientific language modeling

## Executive Summary
SciLaD introduces a large-scale, transparent, and reproducible dataset of scientific publications built entirely from open-source tools and open-access sources. The dataset comprises over 35 million multilingual publications in TEI XML and a filtered English split of 10 million documents, enabling high-quality scientific language modeling. A RoBERTa-base model pre-trained on SciLaD achieves competitive results across scientific NLP benchmarks (NER, PICO, DEP, REL, CLS), matching or exceeding established models like SciBERT. The extensible pipeline supports reproducible data construction and evaluation, advancing accessible and ethical scientific language research.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed SciLaD using open-source tools and open-access scientific publications, extracting content in TEI XML format from multiple sources. The dataset was filtered to create a 10 million document English subset suitable for language modeling. A RoBERTa-base model was pre-trained on this corpus using standard transformer architecture and then evaluated across multiple scientific NLP tasks including named entity recognition, PICO extraction, dependency parsing, relation extraction, and classification tasks. The pipeline emphasizes transparency and reproducibility, with all tools and processes documented for community use.

## Key Results
- SciLaD dataset contains over 35 million multilingual publications with 10 million English documents
- RoBERTa-base model pre-trained on SciLaD achieves competitive performance on scientific NLP benchmarks
- Model performance matches or exceeds established models like SciBERT across NER, PICO, DEP, REL, and CLS tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SciLaD's effectiveness stems from its large-scale, diverse scientific corpus that captures the linguistic patterns and domain-specific terminology of academic writing. By leveraging open-access sources and transparent tools, the dataset avoids the biases and limitations of proprietary collections while enabling full reproducibility. The extensive multilingual coverage, combined with focused English filtering, provides both breadth and depth for scientific language modeling. The RoBERTa-base architecture, when trained on this specialized corpus, learns robust representations for scientific text that transfer effectively to downstream NLP tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **TEI XML format**: Why needed - Standard format for encoding scientific documents; Quick check - Verify XML parsing correctly extracts text and metadata
- **Transformer architecture**: Why needed - Captures long-range dependencies in scientific text; Quick check - Confirm model handles sentence-level context appropriately
- **Scientific NLP benchmarks**: Why needed - Standardized evaluation of domain-specific language models; Quick check - Validate benchmark task definitions and metrics
- **Open-access data sourcing**: Why needed - Ensures reproducibility and ethical data collection; Quick check - Verify all sources comply with licensing requirements
- **Multilingual scientific text**: Why needed - Covers global research output and linguistic diversity; Quick check - Test model performance across different language domains

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Open-access sources -> TEI XML extraction -> Text preprocessing -> RoBERTa-base pre-training -> Fine-tuning on benchmarks -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The data extraction and preprocessing pipeline is critical, as errors in XML parsing or text cleaning will propagate through model training and affect all downstream task performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The choice of RoBERTa-base balances model capacity with computational efficiency, enabling training on large corpora while maintaining reasonable inference times. The focus on open-access sources limits dataset scope but ensures ethical compliance and reproducibility.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent XML formatting across publishers could lead to parsing errors and incomplete text extraction. Sampling bias toward open-access publications may underrepresent certain research areas or publication types.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate XML parsing accuracy across different publisher formats; 2) Test model performance on held-out scientific text from different domains; 3) Compare cross-lingual performance on non-English scientific benchmarks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on open-access sources may introduce sampling biases toward certain disciplines or publication types
- TEI XML parsing assumes consistent formatting across all sources, which may not hold uniformly
- Evaluation focuses on English benchmarks despite multilingual dataset composition
- Performance improvements over established models are modest and may not translate to substantial practical advantages

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Dataset construction methodology and reproducibility pipeline; size and scope of the dataset (35M+ publications, 10M English documents); basic model architecture and pre-training procedure
- **Medium Confidence**: Benchmark results and model performance claims; comparisons with existing models; claims about competitive performance across multiple NLP tasks
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of results to non-English scientific domains; long-term sustainability of open-access data collection; real-world impact beyond benchmark performance

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-lingual Evaluation**: Systematically evaluate the pre-trained model on scientific NLP benchmarks in multiple languages to verify the claimed multilingual capabilities and identify potential performance disparities across language domains.

2. **Publisher Consistency Analysis**: Conduct a systematic audit of TEI XML formatting consistency across different publishers in the dataset to quantify potential parsing errors and their impact on downstream model training and performance.

3. **Longitudinal Data Quality Assessment**: Track the availability and accessibility of the open-access sources over time to assess the dataset's sustainability and identify potential gaps that could emerge as publisher policies evolve or content becomes restricted.
