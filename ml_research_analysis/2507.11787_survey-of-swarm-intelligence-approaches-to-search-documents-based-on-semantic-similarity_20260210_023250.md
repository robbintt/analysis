# Survey of Swarm Intelligence Approaches to Search Documents Based On Semantic Similarity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.11787
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11787
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: SI algorithms (PSO and ACO) show improved accuracy and feature efficiency in document search based on semantic similarity compared to conventional methods

## Executive Summary
This survey examines swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, primarily Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), applied to document search based on semantic similarity. The authors review multiple approaches including PSO variants for high-dimensional feature selection, ACO-based hybrid KNN for sentiment classification, and graph-based ACO for feature selection. The survey finds that while SI methods outperform conventional techniques in accuracy and feature efficiency, most work relies on traditional similarity measures and keyword-based representations rather than advanced sentence embeddings. Key gaps identified include limited application of SI to advanced embeddings and large-scale semantic similarity tasks.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on SI algorithms applied to document search and semantic similarity tasks. It categorizes approaches based on the type of SI algorithm used (primarily PSO and ACO variants) and their application domains including sentiment classification, recommendation systems, and clustering. The review covers both the algorithmic implementations and their performance outcomes, with emphasis on how SI techniques handle feature selection and optimization in high-dimensional document spaces.

## Key Results
- PSO variants demonstrate superior performance in high-dimensional feature selection for document similarity tasks
- ACO-based approaches show improved accuracy in sentiment classification and clustering applications
- Most SI implementations rely on traditional similarity measures rather than embedding-based representations
- SI methods generally outperform conventional techniques in both accuracy and computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Swarm intelligence algorithms work by simulating collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems. In document search applications, these algorithms iteratively optimize feature selection and similarity measures by having multiple agents (particles or ants) explore the solution space simultaneously. PSO uses velocity and position updates to guide particles toward optimal solutions, while ACO uses pheromone trails to reinforce successful search paths. This collective exploration allows SI algorithms to efficiently navigate high-dimensional feature spaces and identify optimal similarity metrics that may be missed by traditional approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: A population-based optimization algorithm where particles move through solution space based on individual and collective best positions. Why needed: PSO efficiently handles high-dimensional feature selection in document spaces. Quick check: Verify PSO parameters (inertia weight, cognitive/social coefficients) are properly tuned for document feature dimensions.
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: A metaheuristic algorithm inspired by ant foraging behavior that uses pheromone trails to find optimal paths. Why needed: ACO excels at combinatorial optimization problems like feature selection and document clustering. Quick check: Confirm pheromone update rules balance exploration and exploitation appropriately.
- **Semantic similarity measures**: Methods for determining document similarity beyond keyword matching, including cosine similarity, Jaccard index, and embedding-based approaches. Why needed: These measures form the objective function that SI algorithms optimize. Quick check: Compare traditional vs. embedding-based similarity measures on benchmark datasets.
- **Feature selection techniques**: Methods for identifying relevant document features while reducing dimensionality. Why needed: Essential for improving search efficiency and reducing computational complexity. Quick check: Validate selected features maintain or improve classification accuracy.
- **Hybrid optimization approaches**: Combinations of SI algorithms with other machine learning techniques like KNN or neural networks. Why needed: Leverages strengths of multiple approaches for improved performance. Quick check: Test hybrid model performance against individual component baselines.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Document Corpus -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> Feature Extraction -> SI Algorithm (PSO/ACO) -> Similarity Optimization -> Search Results

Critical Path:
Feature extraction and similarity measure optimization represent the critical path, as these directly impact search accuracy and relevance. The SI algorithm's ability to efficiently explore the solution space determines overall performance.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Traditional keyword-based vs. embedding-based representations: Keyword methods are faster but less semantically rich
- Population size vs. convergence speed: Larger populations explore more thoroughly but require more computation
- Pheromone evaporation rate vs. solution diversity: Higher evaporation encourages exploration but may lose good solutions
- Feature dimensionality vs. computational complexity: Lower dimensions improve speed but may lose important information

Failure Signatures:
- Premature convergence to local optima (particles get stuck in suboptimal positions)
- Oscillating search behavior (inability to converge to stable solution)
- High computational overhead without performance gains
- Poor generalization to unseen documents

First Experiments:
1. Benchmark PSO feature selection against traditional methods on a standard document corpus using F1-score
2. Compare ACO-based clustering results with k-means on the same dataset using silhouette score
3. Test hybrid PSO-KNN approach on sentiment classification task measuring accuracy and computational time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several key research gaps: limited application of SI algorithms to advanced sentence embeddings like BERT or GPT-based models, scalability challenges when applying SI to large-scale document collections, and the need for systematic evaluation of SI approaches across diverse document types and domains. The authors also note the absence of comprehensive comparative studies between different SI algorithms and traditional machine learning approaches on standardized benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Primary focus on PSO and ACO algorithms, potentially overlooking other relevant SI approaches
- Limited quantitative evidence supporting claimed performance improvements over conventional techniques
- Absence of systematic evaluation of current limitations in handling advanced embeddings and large-scale scenarios
- Reliance on keyword-based representations in most reviewed studies rather than modern embedding techniques

## Confidence
High confidence in identification of PSO and ACO as dominant SI algorithms in document search applications
Medium confidence in claimed performance improvements due to limited quantitative evidence
Low confidence in identified research gaps without systematic evaluation of current limitations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic literature review using broader search terms to identify additional SI algorithms beyond PSO and ACO that have been applied to semantic similarity tasks
2. Perform experimental comparison of identified SI approaches on standardized document similarity benchmarks using both traditional and embedding-based representations
3. Evaluate the scalability of top-performing SI algorithms on large-scale document collections to validate the claimed research gap in handling big data scenarios
