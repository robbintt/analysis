# Standardized Threat Taxonomy for AI Security, Governance, and Regulatory Compliance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.21901
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21901
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Introduces AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy with 53 sub-threats across 9 domains, validated on 133 2025 AI incidents with 100% coverage

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology that categorizes AI-specific risks into nine domains: Misuse, Poisoning, Privacy, Adversarial, Biases, Unreliable Outputs, Drift, Supply Chain, and IP Threat, comprising 53 operationally defined sub-threats. The framework uniquely maps technical vulnerabilities directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling quantitative risk assessment. The taxonomy is validated through analysis of 133 AI incidents from 2025, achieving 100% classification coverage. It is aligned with NIST AI RMF functions and ISO/IEC 42001 controls to facilitate regulatory compliance and auditability.

## Method Summary
The taxonomy was developed through systematic analysis of AI security literature and incident reports, identifying common threat patterns across nine domains. Validation involved classifying 133 AI incidents from 2025 using the taxonomy structure, with 100% classification coverage achieved. The framework maps technical vulnerabilities to business impact categories including confidentiality, integrity, availability, legal, and reputation losses. Alignment with NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 standards was established to support regulatory compliance and auditability requirements.

## Key Results
- Taxonomy structure comprises 9 domains and 53 operationally defined sub-threats
- 100% classification coverage achieved when applied to 133 AI incidents from 2025
- Direct mapping between technical vulnerabilities and business loss categories enables quantitative risk assessment
- Alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and ISO/IEC 42001 controls facilitates regulatory compliance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The taxonomy bridges the gap between technical security teams and legal/compliance professionals by providing a shared language for translating AI risks into measurable financial impacts. By systematically categorizing threats and mapping them to specific business outcomes, organizations can conduct evidence-based risk assessments and make informed governance decisions. The structured approach enables consistent threat identification, classification, and prioritization across different organizational contexts and regulatory frameworks.

## Foundational Learning

**Threat Classification Frameworks** - Why needed: Traditional cybersecurity taxonomies don't adequately capture AI-specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Quick check: Taxonomy includes AI-unique threats like model poisoning and adversarial inputs.

**Business Impact Mapping** - Why needed: Technical teams need to communicate security risks in business terms for executive decision-making. Quick check: Each threat maps to at least one of five business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation).

**Regulatory Alignment** - Why needed: Organizations require frameworks that map to existing compliance standards for auditability. Quick check: Taxonomy explicitly references NIST AI RMF functions and ISO/IEC 42001 controls.

**Incident Classification Standardization** - Why needed: Consistent incident reporting enables pattern recognition and trend analysis across organizations. Quick check: 133 incidents from 2025 successfully classified using the taxonomy.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: AI System -> Threat Domains (9) -> Sub-Threats (53) -> Business Impact Categories (5) -> NIST AI RMF Functions -> ISO/IEC 42001 Controls

**Critical Path**: Incident Detection → Taxonomy Classification → Business Impact Assessment → Risk Quantification → Compliance Mapping → Governance Decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: Comprehensive coverage vs. usability complexity; Technical specificity vs. business accessibility; Static taxonomy vs. evolving threat landscape

**Failure Signatures**: Misclassification leading to underestimated risk exposure; Incomplete threat coverage creating blind spots; Business impact mapping oversimplification

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply taxonomy to classify a sample of recent AI incidents from multiple organizations
2. Map existing AI security incidents to business loss categories using the framework
3. Assess alignment between taxonomy classifications and current organizational risk assessments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Validation relies solely on retrospective incident data from 2025, potentially missing emerging threat vectors
- Direct mapping between technical vulnerabilities and business losses assumes linear relationships that may oversimplify complex risk scenarios
- Framework alignment with NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 is asserted but not independently verified by external auditors

## Confidence

**High**: Taxonomy structure (nine domains, 53 sub-threats) is logically coherent and addresses documented AI security concerns
**Medium**: Incident analysis methodology and classification coverage claim, limited by temporal scope and single-year data
**Medium**: Business impact mapping approach, which requires further empirical validation across diverse organizational contexts

## Next Checks

1. Conduct longitudinal validation across multiple years of AI incident data to test taxonomy completeness and temporal stability
2. Perform independent third-party audits of the taxonomy's alignment with NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 controls
3. Implement controlled field studies with cross-functional teams (technical, legal, compliance) to assess practical usability and identify classification ambiguities in real-world scenarios
