# Improving Perceptual Audio Aesthetic Assessment via Triplet Loss and Self-Supervised Embeddings
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.03292
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03292
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Achieves SRCC up to 0.896 and KTAU up to 0.737 on perceptual quality prediction for generative audio using triplet loss and BEATs embeddings

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of multi-axis perceptual quality prediction for generative audio (TTS, TTA, TTM) when training and evaluation domains differ. The authors propose AESA-Net, which uses BEATs as a self-supervised feature extractor and incorporates triplet loss with buffer-based sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. The model predicts four Audiobox Aesthetic Scores: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness. Experiments show that the model achieves strong generalization to unseen synthetic data, with high Spearman and Kendall rank correlations (e.g., SRCC up to 0.896 and KTAU up to 0.737) across domains. The triplet loss mechanism notably improves ordinal alignment over the baseline, demonstrating robust perceptual prediction without synthetic training data.

## Method Summary
AESA-Net addresses domain gaps between natural and synthetic audio by using BEATs as a frozen self-supervised feature extractor and applying triplet loss with buffer-based sampling to structure the embedding space. The model predicts four Audiobox Aesthetic Scores (Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, Content Usefulness) and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen synthetic data without requiring synthetic training data.

## Key Results
- Achieves SRCC up to 0.896 and KTAU up to 0.737 on Audiobox datasets
- Strong generalization to unseen synthetic data without synthetic training data
- Triplet loss mechanism improves ordinal alignment over baseline model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model bridges domain gaps between natural and synthetic audio through self-supervised BEATs embeddings and structured triplet loss sampling. The buffer-based sampling ensures diverse perceptual similarity representation in the embedding space, while the frozen BEATs extractor provides robust, generalizable features across aesthetic dimensions.

## Foundational Learning
- **BEATs embeddings**: Self-supervised audio representations that capture general audio characteristics
  - *Why needed*: Provide robust features that generalize across domains without labeled data
  - *Quick check*: Compare performance using raw audio vs BEATs features

- **Triplet loss**: Loss function that pulls similar samples together and pushes dissimilar samples apart in embedding space
  - *Why needed*: Structures embedding space by perceptual similarity for better ordinal prediction
  - *Quick check*: Verify embedding distances correlate with human judgments

- **Buffer-based sampling**: Strategy that maintains a buffer of samples to ensure diverse triplet selection
  - *Why needed*: Prevents overfitting to local clusters and ensures representative similarity sampling
  - *Quick check*: Analyze triplet diversity across training iterations

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: BEATs extractor -> Triplet loss buffer -> Embedding space -> Aesthetic score predictors
- **Critical path**: Input audio → BEATs feature extraction → Triplet loss embedding structuring → Multi-task aesthetic prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using frozen BEATs features trades fine-tuning capability for generalization, while buffer-based sampling trades computational overhead for better embedding structure
- **Failure signatures**: Poor generalization to novel domains, collapse of embedding space diversity, or degraded ordinal alignment in predictions
- **First experiments**:
  1. Compare SRCC/KTAU metrics with and without triplet loss
  2. Test performance using random vs buffer-based sampling strategies
  3. Evaluate ablation of BEATs features on cross-domain generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation on truly novel real-world generative audio scenarios outside tested domains
- Assumes BEATs representations are universally relevant across all aesthetic dimensions
- Triplet loss sampling may introduce bias through over-representation of certain similarity clusters

## Confidence
- **High**: Model demonstrates strong generalization across multiple synthetic domains with high rank correlation metrics (SRCC up to 0.896, KTAU up to 0.737) without synthetic training data
- **Medium**: Self-supervised BEATs embeddings consistently improve perceptual alignment across all four Audiobox aesthetic axes; further testing on diverse real-world generative audio would solidify this claim
- **Medium**: Triplet loss with buffer-based sampling is the primary driver of improved ordinal alignment; ablation studies suggest impact but do not fully isolate the mechanism from other architectural choices

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate on real-world generative audio outside TTS, TTA, and TTM (e.g., AI music generation, environmental sound synthesis) to test true domain generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies removing BEATs features and replacing with raw audio or alternative embeddings to quantify their specific contribution
3. Test model performance on culturally or linguistically diverse datasets to assess robustness of aesthetic predictions across different listener populations
