# Hyperbolic Deep Learning for Foundation Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.17787
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17787
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Hyperbolic deep learning methods outperform Euclidean equivalents on hierarchical data tasks while maintaining parameter efficiency

## Executive Summary
This survey examines how hyperbolic geometry addresses fundamental limitations of Euclidean spaces in foundation models, particularly for hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic spaces provide exponential volume growth that enables low-distortion embeddings of tree-like hierarchies using fewer dimensions than Euclidean counterparts. The paper comprehensively reviews hyperbolic neural operations, Transformer variants, vision models, and multimodal architectures, identifying both significant performance gains and persistent challenges in scaling these approaches to large pre-trained models.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing hyperbolic deep learning methods by categorizing them according to their geometric implementation strategies. For neural networks, it covers hyperbolic versions of basic operations including Möbius addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix-vector products adapted to hyperbolic manifolds. Transformer variants employ hyperbolic embeddings for tokens and positional encodings, with specific architectures like HAN, HNN++, FNN, and Hypformer demonstrating improved performance on hierarchical tasks. Vision models adapt vision transformers to hyperbolic geometry through modified attention mechanisms, while multimodal approaches like MERU and HyCoCLIP extend these benefits across different data modalities.

## Key Results
- Hyperbolic models demonstrate superior performance on hierarchical datasets compared to Euclidean equivalents
- Theoretical advantages of exponential volume growth translate to practical dimensionality reduction for tree-like structures
- Current implementations face optimization challenges that may offset theoretical parameter efficiency gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Hyperbolic spaces naturally align with the intrinsic geometry of hierarchical data through their exponential volume growth property. Unlike Euclidean spaces that require exponentially increasing dimensions to maintain low distortion for deeper hierarchies, hyperbolic spaces achieve this with fixed low dimensions. This geometric property enables more efficient representation learning for tree-structured data, with distance metrics in hyperbolic space better preserving parent-child relationships and hierarchical depth compared to Euclidean alternatives.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hyperbolic Geometry**: Non-Euclidean geometry with constant negative curvature; needed for modeling hierarchical data with exponential growth patterns; quick check: verify exponential volume growth property V(r) ∝ e^(r√(-K))
- **Möbius Operations**: Hyperbolic analogs of Euclidean operations (addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication); needed to perform neural network computations on hyperbolic manifolds; quick check: confirm operations preserve manifold constraints
- **Riemannian Optimization**: Gradient descent adapted for curved manifolds using exponential maps and parallel transport; needed for training hyperbolic neural networks; quick check: validate gradient updates remain on manifold
- **Hyperbolic Distance Metrics**: Poincaré or Lorentz distance functions; needed to measure similarity in hyperbolic space; quick check: ensure distances satisfy metric properties
- **Curvature-Aware Attention**: Attention mechanisms adapted to hyperbolic geometry; needed for Transformer variants; quick check: verify attention scores respect hyperbolic distances

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Embeddings -> Hyperbolic Operations -> Manifold Projection -> Output Layer

**Critical Path**: Data flows through hyperbolic neural layers where standard operations are replaced with their Möbius counterparts, requiring periodic projection back to the manifold to maintain validity.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Hyperbolic operations provide better hierarchical representation but require additional computational overhead for manifold projections and Riemannian optimization. The choice of curvature parameter affects representational capacity versus optimization stability.

**Failure Signatures**: Training instability when curvature is too high, poor performance when hierarchy is not the dominant data structure, increased computational cost without corresponding accuracy gains on non-hierarchical tasks.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare Poincaré and Lorentz models on synthetic tree data, 2) Ablation study varying curvature parameters on benchmark hierarchical datasets, 3) Direct comparison of hyperbolic vs Euclidean attention mechanisms on tree-structured classification tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies critical gaps including the absence of fully hyperbolic pre-trained models at scale, the need for efficient training infrastructure optimized for hyperbolic operations, and challenges in geometric interpretability of hyperbolic representations. It also questions whether current hyperbolic architectures can effectively scale to the size and complexity of modern foundation models while maintaining their theoretical advantages.

## Limitations
- Most reported improvements come from small-scale or synthetic benchmarks rather than large real-world datasets
- Hyperbolic operations require additional computations for manifold projections that may offset theoretical parameter efficiency gains
- Limited independent validation studies, with most results originating from the same research groups that proposed the methods

## Confidence
- **Theoretical advantages of hyperbolic geometry**: High
- **Practical implementation challenges**: Medium
- **Parameter efficiency claims**: Low-Medium
- **Vision and multimodal model performance**: Medium-Low
- **Scalability to foundation model sizes**: Low-Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing hyperbolic and Euclidean models on the same backbone architectures across multiple benchmark datasets to isolate the impact of geometric choice from architectural differences.
2. Perform large-scale training experiments with hyperbolic pre-trained models on real-world hierarchical datasets (e.g., knowledge graphs, taxonomies) to verify parameter efficiency claims under practical conditions.
3. Implement and benchmark hyperbolic versions of established foundation models (BERT, CLIP, ViT) on standardized tasks to provide direct, apples-to-apples comparisons with their Euclidean counterparts.
