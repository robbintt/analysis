## Executive Summary
This work presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enables autonomous mechatronics design using large language models (LLMs). The system decomposes complex engineering challenges into modular tasks distributed across specialized agents for mechanical design, electronics, embedded software, and simulation validation. Operating through a language-driven workflow with structured human feedback, the framework successfully generated an optimized autonomous water-quality monitoring vessel, demonstrating strong performance in mechanical iteration and electronics generation while highlighting limitations in autonomous multiphysics simulation configuration.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a hierarchical architecture with five specialized agents: High-Level Planning Agent for problem abstraction, Mechanical Design Agent for parametric CAD generation, Simulation & Validation Agent for physics-based validation, Electronics Design Agent for circuit synthesis, and Embedded Software Agent for firmware generation. The Mechanical Design Agent generates parametric blade geometries using mathematical functions (chord distribution C(z), pitch distribution α(z), airfoil transformations), while the Simulation Agent uses COMSOL for CFD/FEA analysis. The system incorporates human feedback at critical decision points, particularly for modeling sequences and boundary condition definition in complex multiphysics scenarios.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated autonomous water-quality monitoring vessel with optimized dual-propeller propulsion system
- Mechanical Design Agent achieved iterative refinement improving hydrodynamic efficiency through successive CFD evaluations
- Embedded Software Agent produced robust real-time control code with accurate PWM duty cycles (39.2% forward, 31.4% backward, 58.8% left, 15.7% right at ~976Hz)
- Framework demonstrated AMD Level 3 (Semi-Autonomous) capability with substantial human feedback required for complex simulation configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical task decomposition via a High-Level Planning Agent enables cross-domain coordination for complex mechatronics design.
- Mechanism: A planning agent translates system-level requirements into modular sub-tasks, distributing them to specialized agents (mechanical, electronics, software, simulation) that operate within their domain expertise while maintaining coherent system integration.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively abstract high-level requirements and decompose them into domain-appropriate tasks without losing constraint consistency across disciplines.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The design process was carried out by specialized agents, including a high-level planning agent responsible for problem abstraction and dedicated agents for structural, electronics, control, and software development."
  - [Section 3.1] "The proposed employs a hierarchical architecture governed by a High-Level Planning Agent, which decomposes complex challenges into modular tasks for domain-specific agents."
  - [corpus] Related work on knowledge-guided multi-agent frameworks (arXiv:2511.03179) suggests similar decomposition strategies, though direct validation for mechatronics is limited.
- Break condition: If cross-domain constraints (e.g., thermal limits affecting mechanical tolerances) are not properly propagated between agents, system integration failures occur.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Structured human-in-the-loop feedback compensates for LLM limitations in spatial reasoning, geometric cognition, and multiphysics configuration.
- Mechanism: Human feedback is introduced as an external input at critical decision points—particularly for modeling sequences, boundary condition definition, and design ambiguity resolution—enabling iterative refinement where LLM capabilities are insufficient.
- Core assumption: Humans can provide targeted, structured feedback that improves outputs without fully replacing autonomous design generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Operating primarily through a language-driven workflow, the framework incorporates structured human feedback to ensure robust performance under real-world constraints."
  - [Section 5] "Human guidance proved crucial, particularly for defining modeling sequences in mechanical design tasks... more complex setups—especially involving domain definition and intricate boundary conditions in multiphysics modules such as transient fluid simulations—remain highly challenging."
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; related work (arXiv:2511.00122) discusses AI engineer teams but does not specifically validate human-in-the-loop compensation mechanisms.
- Break condition: If human feedback is unstructured or requires excessive intervention, the framework degrades toward AMD Level 1 (assisted automation) rather than achieving higher autonomy levels.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Simulation-guided iterative refinement enables autonomous improvement of mechanical designs through physics-based feedback.
- Mechanism: The Mechanical Design Agent generates parametric designs that are validated by the Simulation & Validation Agent using CFD and FEA; simulation results (stress distribution, flow behavior) feed back into design parameter updates via the iterative formula P_{n+1} = F(P_n, R_n).
- Core assumption: LLMs can interpret simulation outputs and translate them into meaningful parameter adjustments without human interpretation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.3] "Iterative refinement is achieved via: P_{n+1} = F(P_n, R_n) with R_n denoting simulation feedback at iteration n."
  - [Section 4.1] Shows propeller design evolution from initial 3-blade configuration through successive refinements improving hydrodynamic efficiency.
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; no direct validation of simulation-guided LLM refinement loops in neighboring papers.
- Break condition: If the Simulation & Validation Agent fails to autonomously configure complex simulations (noted for turbulent multiphysics), the feedback loop breaks and requires human intervention.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Parametric Geometric Modeling**
  - Why needed here: The Mechanical Design Agent represents designs through mathematical parameterizations (chord distribution, pitch angles, airfoil profiles) rather than direct geometry manipulation.
  - Quick check question: Can you express how a linear chord distribution C(z) = C_r + (C_t - C_r)r maps normalized span position to physical dimensions?

- **Concept: Finite Element Analysis and Fluid-Structure Interaction**
  - Why needed here: The Simulation & Validation Agent uses FEA for stress analysis and CFD for hydrodynamic evaluation; understanding von Mises stress and RANS equations is necessary to interpret agent outputs.
  - Quick check question: What does the von Mises stress criterion measure, and why is it appropriate for ductile material failure prediction?

- **Concept: Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on hierarchical coordination with downstream dependencies—understanding how task decomposition and agent handoffs work is essential for debugging integration failures.
  - Quick check question: If the Electronics Design Agent specifies a motor requiring 12V but the Mechanical Design Agent's hull cannot accommodate the battery volume, at what point does this constraint violation surface?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - High-Level Planning Agent: Receives requirements F, constraints C, human feedback H → outputs design strategy P
  - Mechanical Design Agent: Generates parametric CAD code via LLM-driven mapping L: P → C
  - Simulation & Validation Agent: Configures CFD/FEA, returns simulation feedback R_n
  - Electronics Design Agent: Synthesizes circuits, prioritizes hardware reuse
  - Embedded Software Agent: Generates firmware, implements motor control logic
  - Human Feedback: External input at ambiguous decision points

- **Critical path:**
  Requirements → High-Level Planning (vessel configuration) → Mechanical Design (propeller/hull) → Simulation & Validation (CFD/FEA) → Electronics Design (motor circuits) → Embedded Software (control firmware) → Physical validation

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - LLM autonomy vs. human intervention: Higher autonomy reduces domain expertise requirements but increases risk of configuration failures in complex simulations
  - Parametric abstraction vs. geometric intuition: Parametric modeling enables LLM-driven generation but limits freeform spatial reasoning
  - Hardware reuse vs. custom design: Prioritizing available hardware accelerates development but constrains optimization

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Simulation convergence failures in turbulent multiphysics (requires human boundary condition tuning)
  - Geometric infeasibility in mechanical outputs (solid blocks instead of hollow structures in early hull iterations)
  - PWM timing deviations in embedded firmware (initialization latency causing minor pulse irregularities)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate Mechanical Design iteration loop:** Run the Mechanical Design Agent on a simple propeller specification, verify that at least 3 design iterations produce distinct geometries with improved CFD metrics (reduced flow separation, stable pressure fields).
  2. **Test Simulation Agent autonomy limits:** Provide the Simulation & Validation Agent with a laminar-flow FSI setup and then a turbulent rotating machinery configuration; document which requires human intervention and at what configuration step.
  3. **Verify Electronics-Software integration:** Route Electronics Design Agent output (Arduino Nano + H-bridge specification) to Embedded Software Agent; confirm generated firmware produces correct PWM duty cycles for differential motor control using logic analyzer capture.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the Simulation & Validation Agent be upgraded to autonomously configure complex multiphysics simulations, specifically transient fluid dynamics and boundary conditions, without manual expert intervention?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2 states the agent "could not autonomously configure this turbulent-flow analysis" and struggled with "defining boundary conditions and spatial domain partitioning."
- Why unresolved: The authors note that current LLMs lack the necessary "geometric intuition and visuospatial inference capability" to handle the interface variability and convergence requirements of multiphysics modules.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful autonomous execution of transient CFD simulations with convergence and accuracy metrics comparable to human-configured setups.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the integration of vision-based multimodal LLM capabilities significantly enhance autonomous control logic and spatial reasoning compared to the current text-based workflow?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section explicitly lists future work to "leverage multimodal LLM capabilities, particularly vision-based functionalities, to enhance autonomous control logic."
- Why unresolved: The current framework operates primarily through a language-driven workflow, which inherently limits visual verification and spatial understanding during the design process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative performance metrics of control logic generation and mechanical design optimization between text-only and vision-enabled agents.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific improvements in "structured expert priors" or "few-shot learning" are required to reduce the framework's reliance on human feedback for ambiguous design choices?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper defines AMD Level 4 (Fully Autonomous), the Discussion concedes that "human guidance proved crucial" for modeling sequences, indicating the system currently operates below full autonomy.
- Why unresolved: The methodology relies on external human input to guide agents through ambiguous design choices, creating a bottleneck for the proposed goal of democratizing design for non-experts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Completion of a complex mechatronic design task with human input restricted strictly to initial objective setting (AMD Level 4).

## Limitations
- Simulation & Validation Agent requires substantial human intervention for complex multiphysics configurations, particularly turbulent flow analysis and boundary condition definition
- LLM agents demonstrate limited geometric cognition and spatial reasoning capabilities, necessitating structured human feedback at critical design decisions
- Hardware reuse prioritization may constrain optimal design exploration and prevent fully customized solutions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Hierarchical task decomposition mechanism (supported by explicit framework architecture and agent coordination patterns)
- **Medium confidence**: Human-in-the-loop compensation effectiveness (supported by case study observations but limited by lack of comparative baseline)
- **Medium confidence**: Simulation-guided iterative refinement (supported by CFD validation but limited by known autonomy failures in turbulent multiphysics)

## Next Checks
1. **Test framework scalability**: Apply the multi-agent framework to a more complex mechatronic system (e.g., robotic manipulator with multiple degrees of freedom) and measure agent coordination efficiency and design quality compared to human expert performance.

2. **Quantify human intervention thresholds**: Systematically vary the complexity of simulation tasks (laminar to turbulent flow, simple to multiphysics) and measure the frequency and type of human interventions required across multiple design iterations.

3. **Compare hardware reuse vs. custom design optimization**: Generate two parallel designs for the same system—one prioritizing hardware reuse and one optimizing for custom components—and measure performance tradeoffs in terms of development time, cost, and system efficiency.
