# nabqr: Python package for improving probabilistic forecasts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.17604
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17604
- Reference count: 16
- Achieves up to 40% accuracy gains in wind power forecasting

## Executive Summary
NABQR is a Python package designed to enhance probabilistic forecasts by combining LSTM-based ensemble correction with time-adaptive quantile regression. The method demonstrates significant improvements in wind power production forecasting in Denmark, achieving up to 40% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art commercial forecasts. The package is open-source with documented interfaces for data simulation, model training, and visualization, making advanced forecasting techniques more accessible to the energy systems community.

## Method Summary
NABQR employs a dual approach to probabilistic forecasting improvement. First, it uses LSTM networks to correct ensemble forecasts, addressing systematic biases and calibration issues. Second, it implements time-adaptive quantile regression to estimate conditional quantiles, producing reliable predictive distributions. This combination allows for both improved point forecasts through ensemble correction and better uncertainty quantification through adaptive quantile estimation. The methodology is implemented as an open-source Python package with documented interfaces for end-to-end forecasting workflows.

## Key Results
- Up to 40% accuracy gains in mean absolute terms compared to commercial forecasts
- Effective ensemble correction for wind power production forecasting
- Reliable predictive distributions through conditional quantile estimation
- Open-source implementation with documented interfaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NABQR's effectiveness stems from addressing two key limitations in probabilistic forecasting: ensemble bias and inadequate uncertainty representation. The LSTM-based ensemble correction identifies and corrects systematic errors in weather ensemble predictions, which are often biased or poorly calibrated for specific applications like wind power forecasting. The time-adaptive quantile regression then captures the evolving conditional distribution of the target variable, providing more accurate uncertainty estimates than static or non-adaptive methods. This combination ensures both accurate point predictions and reliable probabilistic forecasts.

## Foundational Learning
- **LSTM Networks**: Needed for sequence modeling and capturing temporal dependencies in ensemble forecasts; Quick check: Verify LSTM implementation handles variable-length sequences and maintains state across batches.
- **Ensemble Forecasting**: Needed to leverage multiple model outputs and quantify uncertainty; Quick check: Confirm ensemble spread correlates with forecast error.
- **Quantile Regression**: Needed for direct estimation of conditional quantiles without distributional assumptions; Quick check: Validate quantile estimates using coverage probability metrics.
- **Time-Adaptive Methods**: Needed to capture non-stationary forecast error characteristics; Quick check: Test model performance across different time periods and conditions.
- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Needed for decision-making under uncertainty in energy systems; Quick check: Evaluate proper scoring rules (CRPS, pinball loss).
- **Wind Power Forecasting**: Domain-specific knowledge for application context; Quick check: Verify forecast accuracy improvements align with operational requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Raw Data -> Ensemble Correction (LSTM) -> Quantile Regression -> Predictive Distribution
- **Critical Path**: Data preprocessing → Ensemble forecast correction → Adaptive quantile estimation → Distribution calibration → Output generation
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Computational complexity of LSTM vs. forecast accuracy gains; adaptive quantile estimation vs. model stability
- **Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to training data; poor generalization to unseen weather patterns; quantile crossing issues
- **First Experiments**: 1) Benchmark ensemble correction performance on held-out data; 2) Test quantile coverage across different prediction intervals; 3) Validate computational efficiency with varying ensemble sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited public validation data makes independent verification difficult
- Lack of clear benchmarking details against baseline methods
- Missing implementation specifics that would enable replication
- Performance generalizability to other regions and applications remains untested
