# 47B Mixture-of-Experts Beats 671B Dense Models on Chinese Medical Examinations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.21701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21701
- Reference count: 40
- Best-performing model (Mixtral-8x7B, 47B total parameters) achieved 74.25% accuracy, outperforming much larger dense models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on Chinese medical examination questions across seven specialties and two professional levels. A dataset of 2,800 carefully curated multiple-choice questions was used to assess 27 state-of-the-art models, including both dense and mixture-of-experts architectures. The best-performing model, Mixtral-8x7B, achieved an overall accuracy of 74.25%, outperforming much larger dense models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B (64.07%). Notably, no consistent correlation was found between model size and performance, highlighting the effectiveness of sparse architectures for specialized medical knowledge tasks. Performance varied significantly across specialties, with cardiovascular and neurology showing higher accuracy, while gastroenterology and nephrology were more challenging. The study also found minimal performance degradation between attending and senior physician levels for top models, suggesting robust generalization.

## Method Summary
The study constructed a benchmark dataset of 2,800 multiple-choice medical questions covering seven specialties (cardiovascular, dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, neurology, nephrology, oncology) and two professional levels (attending physician and senior physician). Twenty-seven state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated, including both dense models (up to 671B parameters) and mixture-of-experts models (up to 141B total parameters). Models were assessed on their ability to correctly answer these medical questions, with accuracy measured across different specialties and professional levels. The evaluation protocol included systematic data curation and rigorous testing procedures to ensure reliable comparisons across diverse model architectures.

## Key Results
- Mixtral-8x7B (47B total parameters) achieved highest overall accuracy at 74.25%, outperforming DeepSeek-R1-671B (64.07%)
- No correlation found between model size and performance, demonstrating sparse architectures' effectiveness
- Cardiovascular and neurology specialties showed highest accuracy, while gastroenterology and nephrology were most challenging
- Top models showed minimal performance difference between attending and senior physician levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of mixture-of-experts models on specialized medical knowledge tasks can be attributed to their sparse activation patterns, which allow for efficient routing of relevant information to specialized expert networks. This architecture enables better handling of domain-specific terminology and complex medical reasoning patterns without the computational overhead of dense models. The lack of correlation between model size and performance suggests that for specialized knowledge domains, architectural efficiency and routing mechanisms are more important than parameter count. The robust generalization across professional levels indicates that these models can effectively capture both foundational and advanced medical knowledge through their specialized routing mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture: Why needed - Enables efficient computation by activating only relevant expert networks; Quick check - Verify that only subset of experts are activated per input
- Chinese Medical Knowledge Domain: Why needed - Specialized terminology and diagnostic reasoning patterns; Quick check - Test model on domain-specific vocabulary and clinical scenarios
- Sparse vs Dense Model Tradeoffs: Why needed - Understanding when architectural efficiency outperforms parameter scaling; Quick check - Compare performance per parameter across model types
- Medical Specialty Categorization: Why needed - Different specialties require different knowledge patterns and reasoning approaches; Quick check - Analyze performance variance across specialties
- Professional Level Differentiation: Why needed - Captures progression from basic to advanced medical knowledge; Quick check - Compare performance across different difficulty levels

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input -> Token Embedding -> Sparse Gate -> Expert Selection -> Expert Computation -> Aggregation -> Output

Critical Path:
The sparse gate mechanism is the critical path, as it determines which experts process each input token. This routing decision directly impacts both computational efficiency and task performance.

Design Tradeoffs:
The MoE architecture trades computational efficiency for routing complexity. While dense models process all parameters for every input, MoE models must maintain multiple expert networks and implement sophisticated routing mechanisms. This creates a tradeoff between parameter count and actual computational cost during inference.

Failure Signatures:
Common failure modes include poor routing decisions leading to incorrect expert selection, insufficient training of certain expert networks, and difficulty handling cross-specialty knowledge that doesn't fit neatly into expert categories. Models may also struggle with questions requiring integration of knowledge across multiple specialties.

First 3 Experiments:
1. Test routing efficiency by measuring expert activation patterns across different question types
2. Evaluate performance on cross-specialty questions to assess knowledge integration capabilities
3. Compare inference speed and computational cost between MoE and dense models of similar accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single-source dataset may introduce systematic bias in performance assessment
- Evaluation limited to multiple-choice questions, missing open-ended clinical reasoning aspects
- Absence of human expert validation for model-generated answers limits confidence in accuracy metrics

## Confidence
- Benchmark validity and methodology (High): Systematic approach to dataset curation and evaluation protocol is well-documented and reproducible
- Performance comparisons across models (Medium): While evaluation is rigorous, potential dataset bias affects cross-model comparisons
- Architecture vs. scale findings (Medium): Conclusion that sparse architectures outperform dense models needs validation on independent datasets
- Specialty-specific performance patterns (Low): Limited sample size per specialty may lead to overfitting to this particular dataset

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validation using independent Chinese medical examination datasets from different institutions to test generalizability
2. Expert human evaluation of model responses on a subset of questions to verify accuracy metrics
3. Extension of evaluation to include open-ended clinical scenarios and case-based questions to assess broader clinical reasoning capabilities
