core_contribution: This paper proposes a method to identify knowledge neurons in multimodal
  large language models (MLLMs) by leveraging activation differences and GradCAM filtering.
  The approach focuses on neurons in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers of MiniGPT-4,
  hypothesizing that neurons with significant activation differences when specific
  objects are removed from images are likely associated with the knowledge of those
  objects.

- Multi-modal knowledge neuron identification method for MiniGPT-4 using activation differences and GradCAM filtering

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a two-stage filtering approach for identifying knowledge neurons in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), specifically targeting MiniGPT-4. The method leverages activation differences when objects are removed from images, followed by GradCAM-based filtering to isolate neurons associated with specific knowledge. The approach demonstrates effective suppression of target knowledge while maintaining other knowledge when noise is applied, validated through quantitative metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore scores averaging 0.77 for suppression effectiveness and 0.73 for knowledge retention.

## Method Summary
The method identifies knowledge neurons in MLLMs by exploiting activation differences in feed-forward network (FFN) layers when specific objects are removed from input images. The two-stage process begins with image inpainting to remove target objects, comparing activation values before and after this modification. Neurons showing significant activation differences are candidates for containing knowledge about the removed objects. A second stage applies GradCAM-based filtering to refine this selection by analyzing attention patterns, hypothesizing that neurons with relevant attention distributions are more likely to represent true knowledge. This approach was evaluated on the MS COCO 2017 dataset using MiniGPT-4 as the test model.

## Key Results
- The method achieves 0.77 average score for knowledge suppression effectiveness when target neurons are noised
- Knowledge retention score of 0.73 demonstrates selective suppression while preserving other knowledge
- Outperforms existing approaches in quantitative evaluations using BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore metrics
- Qualitative analyses with activation heatmaps and neuron decoding validate the relevance of identified neurons to target knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by exploiting the observation that knowledge neurons should show differential activation when the knowledge-bearing content is removed from input. When an object is inpainted out of an image, neurons that genuinely represent knowledge about that object should show reduced activation, while neurons representing other knowledge should remain relatively stable. The GradCAM filtering stage further refines this by assuming that knowledge neurons will have attention patterns that directly correspond to the spatial regions containing the target object. This two-stage process effectively separates neurons that are genuinely knowledge-bearing from those that merely respond to general visual features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers**: Why needed - contain the majority of parameters and are hypothesized to store factual knowledge; Quick check - verify FFN layers constitute ~2/3 of model parameters
- **Activation difference analysis**: Why needed - provides a measurable signal for identifying knowledge-specific neurons; Quick check - compare activation distributions with statistical significance testing
- **GradCAM attention visualization**: Why needed - links spatial attention patterns to knowledge representation; Quick check - validate GradCAM heatmaps align with human object annotations
- **Image inpainting techniques**: Why needed - controlled method for removing knowledge-bearing content; Quick check - assess inpainting quality using image similarity metrics
- **Knowledge neuron concept**: Why needed - foundation for understanding how factual information is stored in transformer models; Quick check - review ablation studies showing performance degradation when knowledge neurons are removed
- **Multimodal alignment**: Why needed - explains how visual and textual knowledge integrate in MLLMs; Quick check - verify cross-modal attention patterns in early fusion layers

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Image -> Vision Encoder -> Cross-Modal Fusion -> FFN Layers -> Language Decoder

### Critical Path
Image → Vision Encoder → Cross-Modal Fusion → FFN Layer Selection → Activation Difference Computation → GradCAM Filtering → Knowledge Neuron Identification

### Design Tradeoffs
- FFN layer focus vs. attention layer exploration: FFN layers contain more parameters and are hypothesized to store knowledge, but attention layers may capture more dynamic knowledge relationships
- Image inpainting vs. masking: Inpainting provides cleaner removal but may introduce artifacts; masking preserves context but may leave residual signals
- GradCAM filtering vs. pure activation analysis: GradCAM adds computational overhead but potentially improves precision; pure activation methods are simpler but may include more false positives

### Failure Signatures
- False positives: Neurons showing activation differences due to general visual changes rather than specific knowledge removal
- Low precision: Many identified neurons having minimal impact on knowledge suppression when noised
- Context dependency: Neuron identification varying significantly across different image contexts for the same object category

### First 3 Experiments
1. Compare activation difference distributions between target object removal and random object removal to establish baseline significance
2. Test GradCAM filtering with varying threshold parameters to optimize the precision-recall tradeoff
3. Evaluate knowledge neuron identification across different FFN layers to determine optimal layer selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method evaluated only on MiniGPT-4, raising questions about generalizability to other MLLM architectures
- Image inpainting may introduce artifacts that influence activation patterns independently of knowledge representation
- Assumes attention patterns directly correlate with knowledge neuron identification, which may not hold for all visual knowledge types
- Quantitative metrics measure output similarity but don't directly verify semantic targeting of suppressed knowledge

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Neurons show activation differences when target objects are removed | High |
| Two-stage filtering effectively isolates knowledge-specific neurons | Medium |
| Superior performance compared to existing approaches | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the two-stage filtering approach on multiple MLLM architectures (e.g., LLaVA, Chameleon, mPLUG-Owl) to assess generalizability across different model families and training regimes
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the GradCAM filtering stage to quantify its specific contribution to neuron identification accuracy and determine whether simpler activation difference methods might suffice
3. Design controlled experiments where specific knowledge is intentionally injected into model weights, then verify whether the method can reliably identify these synthetic knowledge neurons and demonstrate selective suppression of only the injected knowledge
