# Latency-aware Multimodal Federated Learning over UAV Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01717
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01717
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Novel BCD+SCA algorithm achieves 42.49% latency reduction in UAV-assisted multimodal federated learning with 67.99% (IID) and 101.68% (non-IID) accuracy improvement

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses latency optimization in UAV-assisted federated multimodal learning systems. The authors propose a framework where UAVs sense multi-modal data, train local models, and collaborate with a base station to build a global model. To minimize system latency, they jointly optimize UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource management. The proposed approach uses an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques to handle the non-convex problem, achieving significant improvements in both latency and accuracy compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a latency-aware multimodal federated learning framework where UAVs perform data sensing, local model training, and embedding upload to a base station. The system jointly optimizes UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource management using a BCD+SCA algorithm. The framework employs encoder-decoder multimodal fusion with attention-based aggregation, where each UAV trains an encoder on a single modality and the BS aggregates embeddings to train a decoder. The optimization decomposes the non-convex problem into three sub-problems solved iteratively, with convergence achieved in approximately 5 iterations (65 seconds total).

## Key Results
- 42.49% latency reduction compared to baseline methods
- 67.99% accuracy improvement in IID settings over unimodal baselines
- 101.68% accuracy improvement in non-IID settings over unimodal baselines
- Theoretical convergence analysis provided with bounded optimality gap

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The BCD+SCA algorithm efficiently handles the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem by decomposing it into three tractable sub-problems: UAV scheduling and power control, UAV trajectory and resource allocation, and BS resource management. The successive convex approximation technique convexifies non-convex constraints through Taylor expansion, enabling efficient solution via convex solvers. The encoder-decoder multimodal fusion with attention-based aggregation allows effective combination of heterogeneous data sources while minimizing communication overhead by uploading embeddings instead of raw data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)**
  - Why needed here: The joint optimization is non-convex and high-dimensional; BCD partitions variables into blocks (scheduling/power, trajectory/resources, BS resources) solved iteratively.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the three variable blocks used in the algorithm and explain why solving them sequentially is easier than jointly?

- **Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)**
  - Why needed here: Subproblems contain non-convex constraints (e.g., log terms, bilinear forms); SCA linearizes or approximates them around the current iterate to create convex surrogates solvable by convex solvers.
  - Quick check question: How does SCA differ from gradient descent, and what role does the Taylor expansion play in convexifying constraints?

- **Encoder–Decoder Multimodal Fusion in Federated Learning**
  - Why needed here: Each UAV trains an encoder on a single modality; the BS aggregates and concatenates embeddings and trains a decoder. Attention-weighted aggregation across modalities is used for global model fusion.
  - Quick check question: Explain why embeddings are uploaded instead of raw data and how the attention-based fusion weights are computed at the BS.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: UAV nodes (sensing/training) -> BS (aggregation/fusion) -> Optimization controller (BCD+SCA) -> UAV nodes (updated models)

- **Critical path**: 1) Data sensing and local training at UAVs, 2) Embedding and model upload, 3) BS aggregation + decoder training + attention-based fusion, 4) Global model download to UAVs

- **Design tradeoffs**: More modalities improve accuracy but increase overhead; tight latency favors higher power/faster trajectories but consumes more energy; larger mini-batch size reduces variance but increases per-iteration computation

- **Failure signatures**: UAVs with poor channel conditions dominating latency; misaligned modality embeddings reducing fusion effectiveness; SCA divergence with poor initial points

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate UCI HAR experiment with 2 modalities and 20 UAVs; compare convergence and accuracy against unimodal baselines
  2. Run joint optimization algorithm vs baselines while varying UAV count to observe latency and convergence changes
  3. Stress-test under non-IID data distributions and monitor accuracy degradation; evaluate attention-based fusion effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the latency minimization framework be adapted for environments with mobile ground targets and probabilistic Line-of-Sight (LoS) channel models?
- Basis in paper: The system model assumes stationary targets and deterministic LoS channels
- Why unresolved: Current optimization relies on static target locations and deterministic channel gains; mobile targets require dynamic re-scheduling
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified optimization model with target velocity vectors and probabilistic channel blockage constraints

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed BCD-SCA algorithm be accelerated or simplified to support real-time trajectory control in rapidly changing network conditions?
- Basis in paper: Each SCA iteration takes approximately 13 seconds, resulting in 65-second optimization time
- Why unresolved: 65-second optimization delay may be prohibitive for real-time UAV applications with changing conditions
- What evidence would resolve it: Complexity reduction techniques achieving millisecond-level optimization latency

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the Pareto-optimal trade-off between system latency and UAV energy consumption when treated as joint objectives?
- Basis in paper: Problem formulation focuses strictly on minimizing latency subject to energy budget constraint
- Why unresolved: The specific trade-off curve between latency and energy consumption remains unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Multi-objective optimization analysis presenting the Pareto frontier

## Limitations

- Encoder/decoder architecture specifications are not provided, affecting exact accuracy reproduction
- Attention function f(z_m^(k)) is undefined, making fusion layer implementation uncertain
- Critical system parameters like radar sensing configuration and non-IID partitioning method are unspecified
- Theoretical convergence relies on Assumption 4 about trajectory-power independence that may not hold in early rounds

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Optimization framework and BCD+SCA methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Reported latency reduction (42.49%) due to parameter sensitivity
- **Low confidence**: Exact accuracy values without neural network architecture and attention mechanism details

## Next Checks

1. Implement the encoder-decoder architecture with standard MLP layers and a learned attention mechanism, then measure accuracy on UCI HAR to establish baseline performance before optimization
2. Run the SCA algorithm with multiple random initializations to verify convergence behavior and ensure solution independence from starting points
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing joint optimization (T-OPT) against each baseline method under identical conditions to validate the 42.49% latency improvement claim
