# Fiaingen: A financial time series generative method matching real-world data quality

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.01169
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01169
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** Graph-based synthetic financial time series generation with high fidelity and computational efficiency

## Executive Summary
Fiaingen introduces a novel approach for generating synthetic financial time series data using graph-based methods. The technique transforms time series into visibility graphs (natural, horizontal, and multigraph variants) and employs random walks to generate new synthetic sequences. The method was tested on 160-255 stock tickers from the financial sector, demonstrating strong performance against established methods like TimeGAN and cGAN in terms of data quality preservation and computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
Fiaingen converts financial time series data into visibility graphs, creating three variants: natural visibility graphs, horizontal visibility graphs, and multigraph visibility graphs. Random walks are then performed on these graphs to generate synthetic sequences that preserve the structural and temporal properties of the original data. This approach transforms the time series generation problem into a graph traversal problem, enabling efficient synthetic data creation while maintaining key statistical characteristics.

## Key Results
- Achieves strong overlap with real data in t-SNE visualizations
- High ROC AUC scores on classification tasks (up to 0.85)
- Run times in seconds versus hours/days for deep generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the topological properties of visibility graphs to capture the complex temporal dependencies and structural patterns inherent in financial time series. By converting time series into graphs and performing random walks, Fiaingen preserves the essential statistical characteristics while generating novel sequences. The graph representation naturally encodes the relationships between data points over time, allowing the random walk process to maintain temporal coherence and structural fidelity.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Visibility Graphs** - Transform time series into graph structures where nodes represent data points and edges represent visibility relationships
   - Why needed: Captures temporal dependencies in a form amenable to graph algorithms
   - Quick check: Verify that important peaks and troughs in the time series are properly represented as graph nodes

2. **Random Walks on Graphs** - Stochastic traversal of graph edges to generate new sequences
   - Why needed: Provides a mechanism to explore the graph space while maintaining statistical properties
   - Quick check: Ensure generated sequences have similar statistical distributions to original data

3. **Graph-based Time Series Representation** - Alternative to traditional sequential representations
   - Why needed: Enables application of graph algorithms to time series problems
   - Quick check: Compare graph-based metrics with traditional time series metrics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Time Series -> Visibility Graph (Natural/Horizontal/Multigraph) -> Random Walk -> Synthetic Time Series

**Critical Path:** The transformation from time series to visibility graph followed by random walk generation is the essential sequence that enables the method's efficiency and effectiveness.

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- Uses simpler graph-based methods instead of deep learning, sacrificing potential for capturing very complex patterns in exchange for speed and interpretability
- Three different graph variants provide flexibility but require selection based on data characteristics

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Poor overlap in t-SNE visualizations indicates failure to capture essential data structure
- Low ROC AUC scores suggest synthetic data doesn't preserve discriminative features
- Excessive runtime indicates inefficiencies in graph construction or random walk implementation

**First Experiments:**
1. Generate synthetic data from a simple periodic time series and verify basic statistical properties
2. Compare t-SNE visualizations of real vs synthetic data for a single stock ticker
3. Measure ROC AUC on a binary classification task using synthetic-real data mixtures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation relies on classification tasks that may not capture all downstream applications
- t-SNE visualizations are qualitative and may miss subtle distributional differences
- Runtime comparisons focus on generation time, potentially overlooking training overhead
- Limited to financial sector stocks, reducing generalizability across diverse market segments

## Confidence

**High:** Computational efficiency advantages over deep generative models - direct empirical observation
**Medium:** Claims about structural and temporal property preservation - demonstrated through specific metrics but may not be exhaustive
**Low:** Claims about robust downstream task performance - limited evaluation to classification tasks on specific dataset type

## Next Checks
1. Test Fiaingen's performance across multiple financial sectors and market conditions to assess generalizability beyond the financial sector stocks used in the current study
2. Evaluate synthetic data utility on a broader range of downstream tasks including anomaly detection, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization
3. Conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis comparing synthetic and real data distributions using both traditional metrics and machine learning-based divergence measures
