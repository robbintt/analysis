# World Models as Reference Trajectories for Rapid Motor Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.15589
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15589
- Reference count: 10
- Core contribution: World model predictions used as implicit reference trajectories for rapid motor adaptation

## Executive Summary
Reflexive World Models (RWM) addresses the critical challenge of maintaining performance when system dynamics change unexpectedly in learned control policies. The framework achieves this by leveraging world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories, effectively separating the control problem into long-term policy learning and rapid motor adaptation. This separation enables significantly faster adaptation compared to traditional model-based RL approaches while maintaining near-optimal performance through lightweight online updates.

The approach demonstrates substantial improvements in adaptation speed and performance across continuous control tasks including locomotion, with particular advantages under both step and nonstationary perturbations. RWM provides formal stability guarantees through Lyapunov analysis while preserving the flexibility of learned policies, making it particularly suited for real-world deployment where computational efficiency and rapid adaptation are critical requirements.

## Method Summary
The Reflexive World Models framework uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for adaptive control. The method separates the control problem into two components: a learned policy that generates actions based on current state and long-term goals, and an adaptive controller that tracks the world model's predicted trajectories. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, the world model's predictions become inaccurate, and the adaptive controller rapidly adjusts to minimize tracking error between actual and predicted trajectories. This design enables lightweight online adaptation without requiring expensive re-planning or policy retraining, achieving significantly faster adaptation speeds compared to traditional model-based RL baselines while maintaining formal stability guarantees through Lyapunov analysis.

## Key Results
- Achieves 360.56 reward under continuous perturbations compared to 311.67 for TD-MPC2 and 233.42 for fixed policies
- Demonstrates significantly faster adaptation than model-based RL baselines while maintaining near-optimal performance
- Provides formal stability guarantees through Lyapunov analysis while requiring only lightweight online updates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories, creating a natural separation between long-term policy learning and rapid motor adaptation. When system dynamics change, the world model's predictions become inaccurate, but this inaccuracy is directly exploitable by the adaptive controller. The controller treats the discrepancy between actual and predicted trajectories as tracking error to be minimized, enabling rapid online adaptation without requiring expensive re-planning or policy retraining. This mechanism allows the system to maintain stability guarantees while achieving significantly faster adaptation speeds compared to traditional approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: World Model -> Adaptive Controller -> Policy Network -> Environment

**Critical Path**: State → World Model → Prediction → Adaptive Controller → Policy Update → Action → Environment

**Design Tradeoffs**: Separates long-term policy learning from rapid adaptation, trading some computational overhead for faster adaptation and formal stability guarantees

**Failure Signatures**: Degraded performance when world model predictions become inaccurate, instability when adaptation gains are improperly tuned
