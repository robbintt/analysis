- One-line primary result: Advances semantic representation learning to enable localised, quasi-symbolic, compositional control over language models through geometric manipulation of latent space

## Executive Summary
This thesis advances semantic representation learning to render language representations or models more semantically and geometrically interpretable, and to enable localised, quasi-symbolic, compositional control through deliberate shaping of their latent space geometry. Within a VAE framework, it explores two complementary research directions: sentence-level learning and control, and reasoning-level learning and control. The work introduces novel theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies, with experiments demonstrating enhanced interpretability and controllability of latent spaces for natural language tasks.

## Method Summary
The thesis employs a VAE framework to explore semantic control over language models through two complementary approaches. The first direction focuses on sentence-level learning and control, where semantic features are disentangled and manipulated in the latent space to guide sentence generation using explanatory text. The second direction targets reasoning-level learning and control, isolating and steering inference behaviours in the latent space to control natural language inference. Key innovations include formalising semantic features as convex cones in latent space, using dual encoders for syntactic-semantic disentanglement, and encoding reasoning patterns in parametric space for controllable inference.

## Key Results
- Formalisation of semantic features as convex cones in latent space provides a theoretically elegant framework for semantic control
- Effective separation of semantic features through supervision demonstrates improved interpretability of latent spaces
- Improved syntactic-semantic disentanglement via dual encoders enables more precise control over language generation
- Encoding of reasoning patterns in parametric space shows promise for controllable inference in natural language tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The geometric approach works by explicitly shaping the latent space geometry of language models to make semantic representations more interpretable and controllable. By formalising semantic features as convex cones, the method provides a mathematically rigorous way to isolate and manipulate specific semantic properties in the latent space. The dual-encoder architecture separates syntactic and semantic information, allowing for more targeted control over different aspects of language generation. For reasoning tasks, encoding inferential patterns in parametric space enables steering of model behaviour along specific reasoning trajectories.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** - Why needed: Core framework for learning interpretable latent representations. Quick check: Understanding the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and its role in balancing reconstruction and regularization.
2. **Convex Geometry in High-Dimensional Spaces** - Why needed: Mathematical foundation for formalising semantic features as convex cones. Quick check: Ability to reason about convex sets, cones, and their properties in vector spaces.
3. **Dual Encoder Architectures** - Why needed: Mechanism for separating syntactic and semantic information in language representations. Quick check: Understanding how separate encoding paths can capture different linguistic aspects.
4. **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** - Why needed: Benchmark task for evaluating controllable reasoning in language models. Quick check: Familiarity with NLI datasets and evaluation metrics.
5. **Explanatory Text Supervision** - Why needed: Method for guiding semantic feature learning and manipulation. Quick check: Understanding how natural language explanations can be used to shape model behaviour.
6. **Latent Space Manipulation** - Why needed: Core technique for achieving localised, compositional control over language generation. Quick check: Ability to reason about how geometric transformations in latent space affect generated text.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Text -> Dual Encoder -> Latent Space (Convex Cones) -> Decoder -> Output Text
Explanatory Text -> Feature Supervision -> Latent Space Shaping

**Critical Path:**
1. Input text is encoded by dual encoders into latent representations
2. Latent representations are shaped according to semantic feature constraints (convex cones)
3. Shaped representations are decoded into controlled output text
4. Explanatory text provides supervision for feature learning and manipulation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Geometric Formalisation vs. Flexibility**: Using convex cones provides mathematical elegance but may limit expressiveness for complex semantic phenomena
- **Dual Encoder Separation vs. Information Loss**: Separating syntax and semantics can improve control but risks losing important cross-dependencies
- **Parametric Space Encoding vs. Model Complexity**: Encoding reasoning patterns parametrically enables control but increases model complexity and potential overfitting

**Failure Signatures:**
- Inability to generate semantically coherent text despite geometric control
- Overfitting to specific semantic features, leading to loss of general language capabilities
- Difficulty in scaling the convex cone approach to more complex linguistic phenomena
- Limited effectiveness of reasoning control on more nuanced inferential tasks

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Validate semantic feature separation on a controlled synthetic dataset with clear semantic distinctions
2. Test dual encoder disentanglement on a syntactic variation task while maintaining semantic consistency
3. Evaluate reasoning control on a multi-hop inference task to assess scalability of the parametric space encoding approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability and generalizability of geometric control mechanisms beyond experimental domains remain unverified
- Reliance on explanatory text for feature supervision may introduce brittleness with ambiguous or context-dependent semantic features
- Dual-encoder approach for syntactic-semantic disentanglement not validated across diverse linguistic structures or multilingual settings
- Effectiveness of parametric space encoding for reasoning control not demonstrated on complex reasoning tasks

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in the core geometric formalisation and experimental results given focused experimental scope
- Low confidence in broader claims about controllability and interpretability across diverse applications pending more extensive validation
- Medium to Low confidence in the scalability of proposed methods to larger models and more complex linguistic phenomena as these aspects were not the primary focus

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-linguistic experiments to assess the robustness of the semantic feature separation and convex cone formalisation across multiple languages and linguistic structures
2. Evaluate the controllability mechanisms on larger-scale language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) to test scalability and identify potential limitations in more complex model architectures
3. Design and execute experiments on more complex reasoning tasks (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, commonsense inference) to validate the effectiveness of parametric space encoding for diverse inferential patterns
