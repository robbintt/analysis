# Putting on the Thinking Hats: A Survey on Chain of Thought Fine-tuning from the Perspective of Human Reasoning Mechanism

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.13170
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13170
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** First comprehensive survey classifying CoT fine-tuning methods using Six Thinking Hats framework, identifying key challenges and future research directions.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Chain of Thought (CoT) fine-tuning through the lens of human reasoning theory. It systematically categorizes CoT fine-tuning methods using the Six Thinking Hats framework, which represents six key human reasoning abilities: planning, divergent thinking, intuitive judgment, reflection, internal thinking, and factual perception. The survey organizes CoT fine-tuning techniques into two levels: top-level (thinking hats) and base-level (techniques), and analyzes their development trajectories. It identifies key challenges and future research directions while providing a curated overview of datasets and model performances. A continuously updated GitHub repository is maintained to track recent advances in this field.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys Chain-of-Thought fine-tuning methods by organizing them into two levels: top-level "Thinking Hats" (Blue for Planning, Green for Divergent Thinking, Red for Intuitive Judgment, Black for Reflection, Yellow for Internal Thinking, White for Factual Perception) and base-level techniques. The general pipeline involves (1) Data Curation through manual or automatic annotation, (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using "Pre-thinking" objective to establish a "Thinking Model", and (3) Optional Reinforced Fine-Tuning (RFT) using techniques like GRPO or DPO to evolve into an "Insight Model". The survey synthesizes existing literature rather than presenting original experimental results.

## Key Results
- Introduces first comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning using Six Thinking Hats framework
- Identifies key challenges: unfaithful reasoning, reward hacking, and error accumulation
- Provides curated overview of datasets (GSM8K, MATH, HotpotQA, GPQA) and model performances
- Maintains continuously updated GitHub repository tracking recent advances

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explicit Intermediate Supervision (SFT)
- Claim: Introducing explicit intermediate reasoning steps as supervision enables models to learn structured logical pathways.
- Mechanism: Models trained via SFT to predict Chain-of-Thought + Answer given input, forcing decomposition of complex problems.
- Core assumption: Reasoning traces in training data are logically sound and faithfully represent paths to correct answers.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions CoT fine-tuning leverages supervised fine-tuning; Section III.A defines "pre-thinking" objective enabling problem decomposition.

### Mechanism 2: Process-Based Reinforcement (RFT)
- Claim: RFT enhances reasoning by optimizing reward signals based on reasoning quality rather than simple token prediction.
- Mechanism: Models generate outputs, reward models assign values, and algorithms like PPO/GRPO update policy to maximize reward.
- Core assumption: Reward models accurately distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning without reward hacking.
- Evidence anchors: Section III.B details transition from SFT to RFT with PPO/GRPO optimizing advantage function; contrasts ORM with PRM.

### Mechanism 3: Cognitive Modularization (The "Insight Model")
- Claim: Decomposing reasoning into distinct cognitive modes allows targeted optimization of specific reasoning bottlenecks.
- Mechanism: Framework isolates capabilities like "Reflection" or "Divergent Thinking" for independent enhancement.
- Core assumption: Complex reasoning can be improved by independently strengthening constituent cognitive processes and integrating them.
- Evidence anchors: Section IV categorizes techniques by "Hat"; Figure 11 shows different tasks prioritize different "Hats".

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Paradigms**
  - Why needed here: Paper distinguishes between Pre-thinking, Post-thinking, and Multi-task learning as foundational paradigms.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why "Pre-thinking" is generally preferred for high-complexity tasks despite being slower?

- Concept: **Outcome vs. Process Reward Modeling (ORM vs. PRM)**
  - Why needed here: Survey identifies this as central tension in RFT with PRMs offering finer feedback but being computationally expensive.
  - Quick check question: Why might a Process Reward Model (PRM) be more susceptible to reward hacking than an Outcome Reward Model (ORM)?

- Concept: **The Six Thinking Hats Framework**
  - Why needed here: This is core taxonomy used to organize entire survey; understanding "Blue" = Planning, "Green" = Creativity is essential.
  - Quick check question: Which "Hat" capability is most critical for a task requiring correction of initial logical errors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: **Reflex Model:** Standard LLM (Input -> Output). **Thinking Model:** LLM with SFT/RFT (Input -> CoT -> Output). **Insight Model:** Modular system adding specific hats (e.g., Router for Yellow Hat, Critic for Black Hat, Tool API for White Hat).

- Critical path:
  1. **Data Curation:** Generate or annotate CoT data (Manual or Automatic)
  2. **SFT:** Train base model using "Pre-thinking" to establish "Thinking Model"
  3. **RFT (Optional but recommended):** Apply GRPO or DPO using Reward Model to stabilize "Thinking Model"
  4. **Insight Upgrade:** Add specific modules based on "Hat" requirements of domain

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Speed vs. Accuracy (Yellow Hat):** Router may misclassify task difficulty, degrading accuracy
  - **Stability vs. Granularity (RFT):** PRM provides step-level feedback but is less stable than ORM
  - **Cost vs. Control:** External planners (Blue Hat) offer high control but require separate models and engineering overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - **Unfaithful Rationales:** Model generates CoT not logically supporting final answer
  - **Overthinking:** Model reflects excessively on simple tasks (Black Hat overload)
  - **Reward Hacking:** Model exploits PRM to generate reasoning steps that look correct but are flawed

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline SFT:** Fine-tune small model on CoT dataset using "Pre-thinking" objective
  2. **RFT Integration:** Upgrade baseline using GRPO with Outcome Reward Model
  3. **Hat-Specific Ablation:** Implement "Black Hat" reflection mechanism and test on "Reflection-heavy" tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can LLMs be endowed with task-independent, general meta-planning capabilities rather than task-specific planning skills?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VI.A identifies current planning as "task-oriented skills" requiring retraining for new domains; suggests future direction is "cognition-oriented strategy" or "meta-planning."
- **Why unresolved:** Existing models lack ability to abstract general planning strategies that transfer across unknown environments without retraining.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Model demonstrating ability to select appropriate decomposition methods and adjust plans dynamically in zero-shot novel environments.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can reasoning diversity be shifted from surface-level textual variations to fundamental methodological differences (e.g., deductive vs. inductive reasoning)?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VI.B notes current diversity relies on token-level adjustments; authors call for "intrinsic reasoning-method diversity" like generating distinct logical approaches.
- **Why unresolved:** Currently difficult to define, supervise, or reward "methodological" diversity as distinct from lexical variance.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Models autonomously selecting and applying fundamentally different reasoning strategies to solve same problem successfully.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can a single reasoning system effectively balance inherent conflicts between different "thinking hats" (e.g., rigorous planning vs. creative exploration)?
- **Basis in paper:** Section VI.G highlights "Clash of Caps" challenge noting traits like Black Hat (critical reflection) and Yellow Hat (efficiency) often conflict.
- **Why unresolved:** Existing methods struggle to coordinate opposing strategies within single reasoning trajectory, often optimizing for one at expense of others.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Unified framework where model dynamically activates and suppresses specific cognitive modes based on real-time task requirements without performance degradation.

## Limitations
- Survey nature means authors don't present original experimental results but synthesize existing literature
- Six Thinking Hats framework may not capture all relevant reasoning mechanisms in LLMs
- Coverage may become dated as new methods emerge given rapid evolution of CoT fine-tuning techniques

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** General taxonomy of SFT and RFT paradigms is well-established; identification of key challenges is widely acknowledged; basic distinction between ORM and PRM is technically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of Six Thinking Hats framework as organizing principle involves interpretive judgment; claims about hat-capability correlations are based on aggregated literature; recommendations for architecture design are reasonable but not empirically validated
- **Low Confidence:** Predictions about future research directions are necessarily speculative; specific performance comparisons between different hat-specific implementations are not directly validated

## Next Checks
1. **Framework Validation:** Conduct controlled experiment testing whether Six Thinking Hats taxonomy meaningfully predicts performance differences across diverse reasoning tasks
2. **Reward Model Benchmarking:** Systematically compare ORM vs PRM implementations across multiple reasoning domains to quantify tradeoff between stability and granularity
3. **Modular Integration Study:** Implement and test "Insight Model" integrating multiple hat-specific modules to empirically validate whether modular cognitive decomposition improves reasoning over monolithic approaches
