# Towards Temporal Knowledge-Base Creation for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis with Language Models
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.02363
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02363
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Scalable method for temporal opinion knowledge base construction using LLMs as automated annotators

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a scalable approach for building temporal opinion knowledge bases using large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. The method integrates established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. Three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature are defined as schemas for structured representation. The resulting knowledge base captures time-aligned, structured opinions and supports applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages LLMs as automated annotators to construct temporal opinion knowledge bases. A declarative pipeline is designed to integrate well-established opinion mining formulations, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering. Three data models based on sentiment and opinion mining literature are defined as schemas for structured representation. The pipeline is evaluated using human-annotated test samples, with inter-annotator agreement computed label-wise across fine-grained opinion dimensions.

## Key Results
- Scalable temporal opinion knowledge base construction using LLMs as automated annotators
- Structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering through declarative pipeline
- Three data models defined for fine-grained opinion representation compatible with RAG and temporal applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to extract and structure opinions from temporal text data. By defining declarative schemas based on established opinion mining formulations, the method provides clear guidance to the LLM about what to extract and how to structure it. This eliminates the need for manual prompt engineering while ensuring consistency and structure in the extracted opinions.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Declarative annotation pipeline** - A framework that defines what needs to be extracted without specifying how to extract it; needed to provide structure while maintaining flexibility; quick check: verify schema definitions are comprehensive and unambiguous.
2. **Temporal opinion extraction** - The process of identifying opinions with associated time information; needed to capture how opinions evolve over time; quick check: validate time alignment accuracy across different temporal expressions.
3. **LLM-based automated annotation** - Using large language models as annotators instead of human annotators; needed to scale knowledge base creation; quick check: compare LLM annotations against human-annotated gold standard data.
4. **Structured opinion schemas** - Predefined templates for representing opinions consistently; needed to ensure knowledge base interoperability; quick check: test schema coverage across diverse opinion expressions.
5. **Inter-annotator agreement metrics** - Statistical measures of annotation consistency; needed to validate annotation quality; quick check: compute Cohen's kappa for multiple label categories.
6. **Fine-grained opinion dimensions** - Detailed breakdown of opinion components beyond simple sentiment; needed for rich opinion representation; quick check: ensure all relevant opinion aspects are captured.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Raw text data -> LLM annotator -> Schema validation -> Knowledge base storage -> Application interface

**Critical path**: Raw text data flows through LLM annotator where opinions are extracted according to defined schemas, then validated and stored in the knowledge base for downstream applications.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational cost for scalability by using LLMs as annotators rather than manual annotation. This enables large-scale knowledge base construction but may introduce variability in annotation quality and requires significant computational resources.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Inconsistent annotations across similar texts due to LLM variability
- Schema mismatches when encountering novel opinion expressions
- Temporal misalignment in extracted opinions
- Performance degradation with domain-specific terminology

**First experiments**:
1. Test the pipeline on a small, diverse corpus with known temporal opinion patterns to validate extraction accuracy
2. Compare LLM annotations against human annotations on a subset of data to measure agreement and identify failure modes
3. Evaluate knowledge base query performance for temporal opinion retrieval tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on human-annotated test samples rather than comprehensive gold-standard datasets
- Computational costs and latency implications for large-scale deployment are not addressed
- Empirical validation of downstream application performance claims is lacking

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in methodological framework and declarative pipeline design
- **Medium confidence** in annotation quality given limited evaluation scope
- **Medium confidence** in structured representation approach based on established literature
- **Low confidence** in practical scalability and computational efficiency claims

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the pipeline on a multi-domain corpus with temporal diversity and compare LLM annotations against established human-annotated temporal opinion datasets
2. Measure computational costs and latency for processing large-scale temporal opinion extraction, including LLM API usage and storage requirements for the knowledge base
3. Conduct downstream task evaluations by integrating the knowledge base into RAG systems and timeline summarization pipelines to measure performance improvements over baseline approaches
