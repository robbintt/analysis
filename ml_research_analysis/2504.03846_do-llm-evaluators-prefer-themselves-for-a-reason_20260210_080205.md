core_contribution: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
  harmful self-preference bias when evaluating their own outputs compared to those
  from other models. Prior work showed LLMs tend to favor their own responses, but
  it was unclear if this was due to bias or objective quality differences.

# Do LLM Evaluators Prefer Themselves for a Reason?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.03846
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03846
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Stronger models show more self-preference, but much of it is justified by objective quality differences; harmful bias remains when models are wrong and can be mitigated with reasoning-enhanced evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether LLM evaluators exhibit harmful self-preference bias when judging their own outputs against those from other models. Using verifiable benchmarks (MATH500, MMLU, MBPP+) where correct answers can be objectively determined, the authors find that while stronger models do prefer their own outputs more frequently, much of this preference aligns with objectively superior performance. The key insight is that harmful self-preference—preferring one's own objectively incorrect responses—persists particularly when models err as generators, with stronger models showing higher propensity for this bias. The paper demonstrates that inference-time scaling strategies, particularly generating long Chain-of-Thought reasoning before evaluation, effectively reduce harmful self-preference.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted large-scale pairwise comparison experiments where LLM evaluators judged their own generated responses against responses from other models across 11 judge models and 7 evaluatee models. Using verifiable benchmarks with ground truth, they distinguished legitimate self-preference (when the model's output is correct and the other's is incorrect) from harmful self-preference (when the model's output is incorrect but still preferred over a correct alternative). They tested three evaluation modes: no reasoning (logit-based verdict selection), standard Chain-of-Thought, and long Chain-of-Thought using DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Metrics included Self-Preference Ratio (SPR), Legitimate Self-Preference Ratio (LSPR), and Harmful Self-Preference Propensity (HSPP).

## Key Results
- Stronger models exhibit more self-preference overall, but much of this aligns with objectively superior performance (legitimate preference)
- When models generate incorrect responses, stronger models show higher harmful self-preference propensity, stubbornly preferring their own errors
- Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning before evaluation substantially reduces harmful self-preference across all model families
- These findings hold on both mathematical/technical tasks and real-world subjective tasks from LMArena

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Quality-Driven Legitimate Self-Preference
- **Claim:** Strong models prefer their own outputs because they are objectively superior, not due to blind bias
- **Core assumption:** Stronger models possess discriminative power to recognize objective quality differences
- **Evidence:** Clear positive correlation (r=0.906 for MATH) between LSPR and task accuracy
- **Break condition:** Fails when the model generates an incorrect response

### Mechanism 2: Confidence-Driven Harmful Bias
- **Claim:** When models generate incorrect answers, they exhibit stubborn preference for these errors over correct alternatives, increasing with capability
- **Core assumption:** Bias is a specific failure to identify self-generated flaws, not random noise
- **Evidence:** Positive correlation between task accuracy and HSPP (e.g., Qwen2.5-72B shows 86% HSPP on MATH500)
- **Break condition:** Mitigated if evaluation forces explicit, step-by-step verification

### Mechanism 3: Reasoning-Enhanced Verification
- **Claim:** Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning before evaluation significantly reduces harmful self-preference
- **Core assumption:** Model can execute valid reasoning chain leading to correct conclusion with sufficient compute
- **Evidence:** Long CoT models achieve substantially lower HSPP than standard or no-CoT baselines
- **Break condition:** Fails if reasoning chain is too short, constrained, or model's reasoning insufficient

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge Protocol**
  - **Why needed:** Entire experimental framework relies on model $J$ comparing self-generated $y_J$ against other-generated $y_G$
  - **Quick check:** Given verdict aggregation rule $J^*$, what happens if swap-order evaluations yield contradictory decisive verdicts?

- **Concept: Verifiable Benchmarks & Ground Truth**
  - **Why needed:** Enables separation of legitimate from harmful preference by providing binary correctness labels
  - **Quick check:** Why is subset $D_{diff}$ (where only one model is correct) critical for distinguishing preference types?

- **Concept: Self-Preference Metrics (SPR, LSPR, HSPP)**
  - **Why needed:** Understanding specific definitions is essential—SPR is raw rate; LSPR isolates preference when model is right; HSPP isolates preference when model is wrong
  - **Quick check:** If a model has high SPR, does that automatically mean harmful bias? Why or why not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Generator Pool $S_G$ (models producing responses) -> Evaluator Pool $S_J$ (models acting as judges) -> Verifier/Grader (objective ground-truth mechanism) -> Evaluation Loop (pairwise comparison)

- **Critical path:** 1) Generate responses for all models, 2) Label responses using verifier, 3) Run LLM-as-a-Judge pairwise comparisons, 4) Compute LSPR and HSPP metrics

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Standard vs. Reasoning Evaluators: Standard is fast but exhibits high HSPP; reasoning is slower but reduces harmful bias
  - Fixed vs. Dynamic Evaluatees: Fixed set ensures consistent comparison across judges, trading realism for control

- **Failure signatures:**
  - "Confident Hallucinator": High-accuracy model that refuses to accept correct answers from weaker models when it makes mistakes
  - "Self-Style" Bias: Model that prefers own output even when both are correct/incorrect

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Profiling: Run evaluation on MATH500 with target model, calculate raw SPR, isolate HSPP and LSPR
  2. CoT Ablation: Compare evaluation verdicts in Direct, Standard CoT, and Long CoT modes; measure HSPP drop
  3. Cross-Family Generalization: Evaluate strong model against diverse evaluatees; test if HSPP persists when "other" model is clearly superior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1:** Why do stronger models exhibit higher harmful self-preference propensity when they generate incorrect responses, despite being better evaluators overall?
  - **Basis:** Section 5.1 documents counterintuitive correlation but doesn't explain underlying mechanism
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies probing internal model states during self-evaluation of incorrect outputs

- **Question 2:** Can internal confidence signals be leveraged to automatically detect and mitigate harmful self-preference in real-time?
  - **Basis:** Table 20 shows harmful self-preference instances exhibit lower confidence values
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Developing and validating confidence-thresholding approach that filters biased judgments

- **Question 3:** Do reasoning-enhanced evaluators exhibit similar harmful self-preference reductions across more diverse inference-time scaling strategies?
  - **Basis:** Limitations section states Long CoT represents subset of possible inference-time scaling methods
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic comparison of multiple inference-time strategies using HSPP metric

- **Question 4:** Does self-preference extend to preference for outputs from models within the same family, even when not evaluating exact own outputs?
  - **Basis:** Limitations section raises possibility of broader "family-level" affinity effects
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Cross-family evaluation experiments controlling for objective quality differences

## Limitations

- Findings rely on verifiable benchmarks with binary ground truth, limiting generalizability to subjective domains
- Positive correlation between capability and harmful self-preference raises questions about whether this represents fundamental architectural limitation
- Reliance on Long CoT as mitigation suggests issue may be tractable but computationally expensive

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Existence of self-preference bias and distinction between legitimate vs. harmful forms; methodology for separation using verifiable benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that stronger models exhibit more harmful self-preference when wrong; correlation is clear but causal mechanism unclear
- **Medium Confidence:** Effectiveness of Long CoT in reducing harmful self-preference; works empirically but may not be most efficient solution

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Test HSPP correlation with capability on non-mathematical subjective benchmarks where ground truth is determined by human consensus
2. **Alternative Mitigation Strategies:** Evaluate whether other inference-time scaling approaches (majority voting, few-shot prompting) achieve similar HSPP reduction to Long CoT
3. **Architecture-Specific Analysis:** Compare HSPP across different model architectures (transformers vs. state-space models) to determine if harmful self-preference is architecture-dependent
