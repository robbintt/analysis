# Length Aware Speech Translation for Video Dubbing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00740
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00740
- Reference count: 0
- Generates length-controlled translations (short, normal, long) for video dubbing while maintaining BLEU scores

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of aligning translated audio with source audio in video dubbing. The authors develop a phoneme-based end-to-end length-sensitive speech translation (LSST) model that generates translations of varying lengths using predefined tags. They also introduce length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding pass. This approach maintained comparable BLEU scores compared to a baseline without length awareness while significantly enhancing synchronization quality between source and target audio, achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) gain of 0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean, respectively.

## Method Summary
The LSST model uses phoneme-based length ratios to generate translations of varying lengths (short, normal, long) by prepending length control tokens. Length tokens are assigned during training based on target-to-source phoneme length ratios with a threshold α=0.1. The model employs LABS decoding, which initializes beam search with all three length tokens simultaneously and maintains length diversity through specialized pruning. The approach uses a conformer encoder (24 blocks) and transformer decoder (6 blocks) trained on ~85K hours of Spanish and Korean audio to English. During inference, the best translation is selected based on duration model estimates that align with source audio duration.

## Key Results
- MOS gain of 0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean synchronization quality
- Maintained BLEU scores comparable to baseline (23.66→23.23 for Spanish)
- 4.3% latency increase for LABS compared to standard beam search

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Length Token Conditioning
Prepending length control tokens to target translations enables controlled generation of short, normal, or long outputs. During training, length tags are assigned based on target-to-source phoneme length ratio with threshold α=0.1, and the model learns to associate each token with corresponding output brevity or verbosity.

### Mechanism 2: LABS Single-Pass Decoding
Initializing beam search with multiple length tokens produces diverse length variants without tripling inference cost. Beam is initialized with all three length tokens simultaneously, and pruning ensures top-N selection while preserving at least one hypothesis per length category.

### Mechanism 3: Phoneme-Based Length Ratio
Phoneme count provides more consistent cross-language length comparison than character count. Characters in different scripts encode varying numbers of phonemes, and phoneme counting normalizes across writing systems, enabling consistent length ratio thresholds.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Beam Search Decoding**
  - Why needed here: LABS modifies standard beam search; understanding pruning, hypothesis expansion, and score accumulation is prerequisite.
  - Quick check question: Given a beam size of 5 and vocabulary of 10K, how many candidate hypotheses are evaluated before pruning at each step?

- Concept: **Phoneme-to-Duration Mapping in TTS**
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on duration models estimating speaking time from phoneme sequences; alignment quality depends on this estimation accuracy.
  - Quick check question: Why might phoneme count correlate better with speech duration than character count for cross-lingual comparisons?

- Concept: **Length-Controlled Machine Translation**
  - Why needed here: LSST extends length-control techniques from text MT to speech-to-text; prior token-based methods inform the design.
  - Quick check question: What are two alternative approaches to controlling output length in MT besides prepending control tokens?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source Audio → Conformer Encoder (24 blocks) → Transformer Decoder (6 blocks) → LABS Decoding (initialized with <s>, <n>, <l>) → N-best List (3 length variants) → Duration Model → Best Alignment Selection → Target Text

- Critical path:
  1. Audio encoding through conformer blocks (largest computational component)
  2. LABS beam expansion with length-aware pruning
  3. Duration estimation via LeanSpeech G2P + duration model
  4. Selection based on source/hypothesis duration match

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Beam size vs. latency: Paper uses unspecified N; larger N improves diversity but increases 4.3% latency overhead
  - BLEU vs. SRC: Spanish BLEU marginally declines (23.66 → 23.23) while SRC improves 16.3%
  - Training data coverage: Model trained on 85K hours per language; smaller datasets may not support reliable length token learning

- Failure signatures:
  - All three length variants produce similar outputs → beam size too small or length tokens not learned
  - SRC degrades despite LABS → duration model inaccurate for target speaker
  - Latency >10% increase → pruning not preserving length diversity efficiently

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablation on length units**: Compare character-based vs. phoneme-based length ratios on a language pair with different scripts (e.g., English↔Japanese) to validate cross-lingual robustness.
  2. **Beam size sweep**: Test N ∈ {3, 5, 10, 15} to find optimal tradeoff between SRC improvement and latency overhead.
  3. **Duration model accuracy**: Correlate estimated duration (without audio synthesis) with actual TTS output duration to validate the selection criterion.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can continuous or fine-grained length control improve synchronization accuracy compared to the three discrete tags (short, normal, long)?
The discrete bins may lack the precision needed to match source audio duration exactly, potentially leaving a residual alignment gap that continuous control could fill.

### Open Question 2
How does LSST performance vary when translating into morphologically rich or low-resource languages?
It is unclear if phoneme-based length ratios are sufficient to handle target languages with complex morphology or flexible word order where generating concise "short" translations might be structurally difficult.

### Open Question 3
Does the "short" translation strategy compromise semantic adequacy or nuance?
BLEU scores often correlate poorly with semantic preservation in constrained translation scenarios; the model might be dropping necessary adjectives or clauses to meet length constraints.

### Open Question 4
Is the system robust to variations in the Text-to-Speech (TTS) speaker identity used for duration estimation?
If the duration model is biased toward a specific speaking rate, the selected hypothesis might not align well when synthesized by a faster or slower target voice.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on reliable G2P conversion which may fail for languages with complex orthographies
- Effectiveness depends on training data distribution being representative of inference needs
- Limited evaluation to Spanish and Korean to English, raising questions about cross-lingual generalization

## Confidence
- High Confidence: LABS algorithm produces multiple length variants, phoneme-based length ratio approach is theoretically sound, MOS improvements are measurable, 4.3% latency claim is supported
- Medium Confidence: BLEU score maintenance, length token conditioning effectiveness, duration model-based selection criterion
- Low Confidence: Effectiveness on languages beyond Spanish/Korean, scalability to smaller datasets, generalization to real-world dubbing scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test**: Implement LSST for English→French and measure SRC improvements and BLEU degradation to assess robustness.
2. **Beam Size Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary beam size N from 3 to 15 and measure tradeoff between SRC improvement, BLEU changes, and latency overhead.
3. **Duration Model Validation**: Correlate estimated durations from LeanSpeech duration model with actual synthesized audio durations to quantify reliability of selection criterion.
