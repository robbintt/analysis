# Redefining Experts: Interpretable Decomposition of Language Models for Toxicity Mitigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16660
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16660
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 58% reduction in toxicity on RealToxicPrompts benchmark while maintaining language quality with minimal computational overhead

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EigenShift, a novel training-free intervention method for mitigating toxic content generation in large language models. The approach addresses the instability and language quality degradation associated with neuron-level interventions by leveraging interpretable, layer-wise semantic directions. Through eigen-decomposition of final output layer representations, EigenShift identifies and suppresses "generation experts" associated with toxic content while preserving "detection experts" and overall linguistic competence. The method requires no additional training or fine-tuning and demonstrates significant improvements over existing baselines on toxicity detection benchmarks, achieving a 58% reduction in toxicity while maintaining low perplexity.

## Method Summary
EigenShift operates by decomposing the final layer representations of language models into interpretable semantic directions using eigen-decomposition. The method identifies "generation experts" (directions associated with toxic content generation) and "detection experts" (directions associated with content moderation), then suppresses the toxic semantic directions while preserving the rest. Unlike previous neuron-level interventions that target individual activations, EigenShift works with aggregated layer-wise features that provide more stable and interpretable signals for toxicity control. The approach is training-free and incurs minimal computational overhead, making it practical for deployment on existing models without additional fine-tuning or architectural modifications.

## Key Results
- Achieves 58% reduction in toxicity on RealToxicPrompts benchmark
- Maintains low perplexity (+3.62) while reducing toxicity, demonstrating preserved language quality
- Outperforms all baseline methods with a TPH score of 60.37%
- Layer-wise representations significantly outperform neuron-based methods for toxicity detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EigenShift exploits the structured nature of semantic representations in language models' final layers. By decomposing these representations into principal components, the method identifies interpretable directions in the model's semantic space that correspond to toxic content generation. The eigen-decomposition captures the covariance structure of activations, revealing stable patterns that single neurons cannot provide. This layer-wise approach benefits from the aggregation of information across multiple neurons, reducing the noise and instability inherent in individual neuron manipulation. The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to precisely target toxic semantic directions while leaving other linguistic capabilities intact.

## Foundational Learning
- **Eigen-decomposition**: Matrix factorization technique that reveals principal directions of variance in data; needed to identify stable semantic directions in model representations
- **Perplexity**: Standard language model evaluation metric measuring predictive uncertainty; quick check: lower values indicate better language modeling
- **Toxicity detection benchmarks**: Standardized datasets (Jigsaw, ToxiCN, RealToxicPrompts) for evaluating content moderation systems; needed for objective performance comparison
- **Semantic directions**: Interpretable axes in the model's latent space corresponding to specific concepts or attributes; quick check: should align with human-interpretable concepts
- **Harmonic mean**: Mathematical aggregation method that balances two metrics; needed for the TPH score to prevent one metric from dominating
- **Layer-wise representations**: Aggregated activations across all neurons in a given layer; quick check: should capture higher-level semantic information than individual neurons

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input text -> Language model layers -> Final layer representations -> Eigen-decomposition -> Identification of toxic semantic directions -> Suppression of "generation experts" -> Output text

Critical Path:
The critical path runs through the final layer representations, where semantic meaning is most concentrated. The eigen-decomposition step is crucial as it transforms raw activations into interpretable semantic directions that can be manipulated for toxicity control.

Design Tradeoffs:
The method trades the precision of neuron-level control for the stability and interpretability of layer-wise approaches. While neuron interventions can theoretically be more targeted, they suffer from instability and language degradation. EigenShift sacrifices some potential fine-grained control to achieve robust, interpretable results that preserve overall language quality.

Failure Signatures:
- If toxic directions are not properly identified, the method will fail to reduce toxicity effectively
- Over-suppression of semantic directions may lead to unnatural or degraded language output
- The method assumes that toxic content is represented as stable directions in the final layer, which may not hold for all model architectures

Three First Experiments:
1. Apply EigenShift to a small language model and manually inspect whether identified "generation experts" correspond to intuitive toxic concepts
2. Test the stability of identified toxic directions across different random seeds and prompt initializations
3. Evaluate the method's performance on non-toxicity-related semantic directions to ensure it doesn't inadvertently suppress benign content

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method's reliance on final-layer eigen-decomposition assumes these representations capture all meaningful semantic directions, which may not generalize across all architectures
- The TPH metric's harmonic mean formulation may mask situations where toxicity reduction comes at substantial language quality cost
- The evaluation focuses on autoregressive models, leaving open questions about applicability to decoder-only transformers and other architectures

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- Layer-wise representations significantly outperform neuron-based methods for toxicity detection
- EigenShift achieves substantial toxicity reduction while maintaining language quality on benchmarks

Medium Confidence:
- The method's effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios and different model architectures
- The stability of identified semantic directions across different model states and prompts

Low Confidence:
- The claim of preserved "linguistic competence" based primarily on perplexity metrics
- The interpretability of identified "generation experts" versus "detection experts" without qualitative semantic analysis

## Next Checks
1. Test EigenShift's stability by applying it to the same model with different random seeds and prompt initializations to assess consistency of identified toxic semantic directions.

2. Evaluate the method on a diverse set of language models (including decoder-only transformers and models of different scales) to verify architectural generalizability.

3. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether toxicity reduction translates to improved user experience and whether language quality degradation occurs in subtle ways not captured by perplexity metrics.
