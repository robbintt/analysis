# Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR) Evaluation for Unstructured Survey data Modeling and Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12126
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12126
- Reference count: 0
- LLMs evaluated: GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, GPT-4o; GPT-3.5 achieved 0.855 mean similarity, 16 min runtime

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two evaluation frameworks—Scalability Analysis and Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR)—to assess the quality of large language model (LLM)-based text augmentation in low-resource natural language processing settings. The frameworks measure semantic consistency and stability across varying augmentation volumes and iterative refinement cycles using cosine similarity with BERT embeddings. Empirical evaluation across four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates that GPT-3.5 Turbo provides the best balance of semantic fidelity (mean similarity 0.855), diversity, and computational efficiency (16 minutes for 100 augmentations per sentence). When applied to topic modeling with BERTopic and GPT-enhanced labeling, the approach increases topic granularity by 400%, eliminates topic overlap, and improves coherence to 0.526. The ablation study confirms that combining augmentation with GPT-based topic labeling yields optimal performance.

## Method Summary
The evaluation uses cosine similarity with bert-base-nli-mean-tokens embeddings to measure semantic retention during text augmentation at scales of 5×, 25×, 50×, 75×, and 100×. IASR runs 5 iterations of augmentation-summarization cycles using either T5-Base or the same LLM for self-summarization. Topic modeling employs BERTopic with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings and few-shot GPT-based labeling. The study tests four LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, GPT-4o) on survey data, measuring mean similarity, standard deviation, topic coherence (C_V), diversity, and overlap. Code is available at https://github.com/anjurgupta/IASR-Survey-Data.

## Key Results
- GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the best balance with mean similarity 0.855, no duplicate generations, and 16-minute runtime for 100 augmentations
- IASR revealed Claude 3.5's semantic drift under external summarization (similarity dropped to 0.7008 by iteration 5)
- BERTopic + GPT labeling on augmented data increased topic granularity by 400% and improved coherence to 0.526 with zero overlap
- Ablation study confirmed that augmentation combined with GPT labeling yields optimal topic modeling performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Scaling augmentation volume maintains semantic fidelity if measured via embedding consistency. Scalability Analysis evaluates the relationship between augmentation volume (5×–100×) and semantic retention by computing cosine similarity between BERT embeddings of original and generated text, quantifying whether increasing data volume degrades meaning. The core assumption is that high cosine similarity in embedding space correlates with preserved semantic utility for downstream tasks. Break condition: semantic similarity drops below 0.80 or variance increases significantly as volume scales.

### Mechanism 2
Iterative summarization cycles act as a stress test to reveal semantic drift. IASR recursively summarizes and re-augments text, forcing the model to compress and regenerate content to expose instability or hallucination trends over successive iterations (diagnosed via similarity scores). The core assumption is that compounding errors will manifest as a measurable decline in similarity scores across iterations. Break condition: consistent downward trend in similarity scores across iterations.

### Mechanism 3
Combining LLM augmentation with GPT-based labeling optimizes topic modeling granularity without sacrificing coherence. A hybrid pipeline uses LLMs to expand the dataset for density while GPT-based few-shot labeling enforces semantic structure on the resulting clusters. The core assumption is that BERTopic requires sufficient data density to form distinct clusters while LLMs provide better semantic labels than standard extraction methods. Break condition: topic overlap increases or coherence scores drop below the non-augmented baseline.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Cosine Similarity & Vector Space
  - **Why needed here**: The evaluation framework relies on measuring the angle between sentence vectors to quantify "semantic drift." Without understanding that distance ≈ difference in meaning, the metrics are uninterpretable.
  - **Quick check question**: If two sentences have a cosine similarity of 0.95, are they likely discussing different topics or the same topic with different wording?

- **Concept**: Semantic Drift in Recursive Generation
  - **Why needed here**: IASR is specifically designed to detect this. Engineers must understand that LLMs can introduce minor deviations in each generation step, which compound over iterations.
  - **Quick check question**: Why would an LLM summarizing its own previous output potentially lead to lower factual accuracy over 5 iterations?

- **Concept**: Data Sparsity in Unsupervised Learning
  - **Why needed here**: The paper addresses "low-resource settings." Understanding why clustering algorithms fail when data is scarce is key to valuing the augmentation strategy.
  - **Quick check question**: How does increasing the sample size via augmentation help a clustering algorithm distinguish between two closely related topics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw survey text → LLM augmentor → Sentence-BERT evaluator → T5/GPT refiner → BERTopic + GPT labeler
- **Critical path**: 1) Validate with Scalability Analysis (ensure similarity > 0.85), 2) Test with IASR (confirm stability; prefer self-summarization for Claude), 3) Deploy: augment → embed → cluster → label
- **Design tradeoffs**: GPT-3.5 offers speed and consistency; Claude risks redundancy and drift under external summarization. External summarization prevents bias but may disrupt flow; self-summarization is consistent but risks hallucination loops.
- **Failure signatures**: High variance in similarity scores, duplicate generation rate > 0%, non-zero Jaccard similarity in final topics
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Scalability Stress Test: generate 100 augmentations with GPT-3.5 and plot similarity distribution, 2) IASR Protocol: run 5 cycles with T5 vs GPT-self to identify drift patterns, 3) Ablation Study: compare BERTopic on raw vs augmented data for topic count and coherence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Open Question 1**: Does IASR maintain semantic stability when applied to open-weight or encoder-decoder models like T5? (Basis: authors suggest future work on open-weight LLMs and hybrid architectures)
- **Open Question 2**: How does IASR evaluate robustness when augmentation involves non-paraphrastic transformations like style transfer? (Basis: authors propose expanding IASR to transformations like back-translation and style transfer)
- **Open Question 3**: Can explicit control mechanisms like prompt attribution resolve the reproducibility limitations of template-driven prompting? (Basis: authors note lack of explicit control mechanisms and suggest prompt attribution models)

## Limitations
- Reliance on cosine similarity with BERT embeddings assumes semantic proximity correlates with task utility—a reasonable but imperfect proxy
- The Faculty Career-Life Survey dataset limits generalizability without testing across diverse domains and languages
- Self-summarization in IASR could introduce model-specific biases, though external T5-Base partially mitigates this

## Confidence
- **High**: Scalability Analysis effectively quantifies semantic retention across augmentation volumes (supported by consistent similarity metrics and ablation study)
- **Medium**: IASR successfully identifies semantic drift in iterative cycles (evidenced by Claude 3.5's performance degradation, but limited to two summarization strategies)
- **Medium**: Combined augmentation and GPT labeling optimizes topic modeling (robust coherence gains shown, but dependent on dataset characteristics and prompt quality)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Testing**: Apply frameworks to survey data from healthcare, education, and customer feedback to verify generalizability beyond academic contexts
2. **Extreme Scale Analysis**: Extend Scalability Analysis to 200× and 500× augmentation to identify breaking points in semantic retention
3. **Human Evaluation**: Conduct blind assessments comparing LLM-generated topics and labels against human annotations to validate automated coherence and semantic accuracy
