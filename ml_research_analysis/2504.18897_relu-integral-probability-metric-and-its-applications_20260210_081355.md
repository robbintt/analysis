# ReLU integral probability metric and its applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.18897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18897
- Reference count: 24
- This paper introduces the ReLU integral probability metric (ReLU-IPM), a parametric distance measure between probability distributions that leverages single-node neural networks with ReLU activation as discriminators.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the ReLU integral probability metric (ReLU-IPM), a novel parametric approach for measuring distances between probability distributions. The method uses single-node neural networks with ReLU activation as discriminators, offering computational efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional settings. The authors establish theoretical connections between ReLU-IPM and Hölder-IPM, demonstrating that ReLU-IPM can serve as a surrogate when discriminators are sufficiently smooth. The work is validated through applications in causal inference and fair representation learning, showing competitive performance against established baselines.

## Method Summary
The ReLU integral probability metric introduces a parametric distance measure between probability distributions by leveraging single-node neural networks with ReLU activation as discriminators. This approach offers computational advantages over nonparametric alternatives while maintaining favorable convergence rates. The method establishes theoretical connections with Hölder-IPM, showing that ReLU-IPM can approximate traditional integral probability metrics when discriminators possess sufficient smoothness. The parametric nature reduces hyperparameter requirements compared to nonparametric alternatives like MMD and Wasserstein distances.

## Key Results
- ReLU-CB estimator achieves parametric convergence rates and outperforms competitors on synthetic data for causal inference
- ReLU-FRL achieves better fairness-accuracy trade-offs compared to baselines including SIPM, MMD, and adversarial approaches across multiple benchmark datasets
- The method requires fewer hyperparameters than nonparametric alternatives while maintaining comparable or superior performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ReLU-IPM works by parameterizing the discriminator class in integral probability metrics using single-node neural networks with ReLU activation. This parameterization strikes a balance between expressiveness and computational tractability, allowing the method to capture essential distributional differences while remaining scalable to high dimensions. The ReLU activation provides piecewise linear discriminators that can approximate a wide range of functions while maintaining computational efficiency. The theoretical connection to Hölder-IPM ensures that when discriminators are sufficiently smooth, ReLU-IPM provides a reliable approximation to more traditional nonparametric approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Integral Probability Metrics**: Distance measures between probability distributions using discriminators from a function class. Needed to understand the theoretical framework; quick check: verify the connection between ReLU-IPM and standard IPM formulations.

**Causal Inference Estimators**: Methods for estimating treatment effects from observational data. Needed to contextualize the ReLU-CB application; quick check: confirm the doubly robust property of the estimator.

**Fair Representation Learning**: Techniques for learning representations that preserve utility while satisfying fairness constraints. Needed to understand the ReLU-FRL application; quick check: verify the fairness-accuracy trade-off formulation.

**Hölder Continuity**: A smoothness condition on functions that bounds the rate of change. Needed for theoretical analysis of ReLU-IPM; quick check: confirm the smoothness assumptions required for the Hölder-IPM connection.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data distributions -> ReLU discriminators -> Distance metric computation -> Application-specific objectives (causal inference or fair learning)

**Critical Path**: The discriminator optimization loop forms the critical path, where single-node ReLU networks are trained to maximize the distance between distributions, with gradients flowing to both the discriminator parameters and application-specific objectives.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Parametric discriminators offer computational efficiency but may miss complex distributional features that nonparametric methods capture. The ReLU activation provides a good balance between expressiveness and tractability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate insufficient discriminator capacity (ReLU networks too simple), inappropriate smoothness assumptions for the theoretical connection to Hölder-IPM, or misalignment between the parametric family and the true distributional differences.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify that ReLU-IPM converges to zero when comparing identical distributions
2. Test the method on simple Gaussian distributions with known analytical distances
3. Evaluate the impact of ReLU network width on approximation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees rely on specific smoothness assumptions for underlying discriminators
- Theoretical connections to Hölder-IPM require careful calibration of parametric discriminators
- Empirical evaluations primarily conducted on synthetic data for causal inference

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Computational efficiency claims and scalability to high-dimensional settings are well-supported by methodology and experimental design.

**Medium Confidence**: Theoretical connections between ReLU-IPM and Hölder-IPM may face practical limitations when applied to non-smooth or highly complex distributions.

**Medium Confidence**: Fair representation learning results show promising performance, but comparison with state-of-the-art methods could benefit from additional ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct robustness analysis by evaluating ReLU-IPM performance across distributions with varying degrees of smoothness and dimensionality to test theoretical assumptions.

2. Implement a systematic ablation study comparing ReLU-IPM against its nonparametric counterparts (MMD, SIPM) while controlling for hyperparameter settings to isolate performance differences.

3. Apply the causal inference methodology to semi-synthetic datasets derived from real-world observational studies to assess practical applicability beyond controlled synthetic environments.
