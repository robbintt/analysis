# Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07154
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07154
- Authors: Jiaming Song; Linqi Zhou
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Proposed inference-first approach with Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) achieves over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency compared to traditional diffusion models

## Executive Summary
Generative pre-training algorithms have stagnated, dominated by autoregressive models for discrete data and diffusion models for continuous data. This paper proposes an inference-first perspective that emphasizes scaling efficiency in sequence length for autoregressive models and refinement steps for diffusion models. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a case study, the authors demonstrate that addressing inference limitations in diffusion models through architectural modifications—specifically adding target timestep inputs to the denoising network—yields a stable, single-stage algorithm with superior sample quality and dramatically improved inference efficiency.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces an inference-first perspective for designing generative pre-training algorithms, focusing on scaling efficiency rather than traditional optimization objectives. The authors implement Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, modifying the standard diffusion model architecture by incorporating target timestep information directly into the denoising network. This architectural change transforms the multi-stage diffusion process into a more efficient single-stage algorithm. The approach maintains or improves sample quality while achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in inference efficiency compared to conventional diffusion models.

## Key Results
- Proposed IMM algorithm achieves over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency than traditional diffusion models
- Single-stage implementation maintains superior sample quality while reducing computational overhead
- Adding target timestep inputs to denoising network creates stable training dynamics for efficient inference
- Inference-first design approach unlocks new possibilities for generative pre-training algorithm development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper argues that current generative pre-training algorithms are limited by their focus on training objectives rather than inference efficiency. Autoregressive models struggle with sequence length scaling, while diffusion models require many refinement steps. By prioritizing inference scalability from the outset, the authors demonstrate that architectural modifications—such as incorporating timestep information directly into the denoising process—can simultaneously improve training stability and inference efficiency. The mechanism works by reducing the number of sequential operations required during generation while maintaining the probabilistic modeling capabilities of diffusion processes.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input data -> Target timestep encoder -> Denoising network -> Generated output
- Critical path: The denoising network operates directly on corrupted inputs with timestep conditioning, eliminating intermediate steps
- Design tradeoffs: Single-stage efficiency vs. potential loss of fine-grained control over the generation process
- Failure signatures: Training instability when timestep information is not properly incorporated, reduced sample quality with aggressive efficiency optimizations
- First experiments: 1) Compare inference time scaling with sequence length for IMM vs. autoregressive models; 2) Measure sample quality degradation as refinement steps are reduced; 3) Analyze training stability across different timestep conditioning strategies

## Next Checks
