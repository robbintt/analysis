# Conformalized-KANs: Uncertainty Quantification with Coverage Guarantees for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in Scientific Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.15240
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15240
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Ensemble KANs with split conformal prediction achieve guaranteed 95% coverage, outperforming standard ensemble uncertainty estimates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs, while efficient, often produce inaccurate point predictions, especially with limited data. The authors introduce Conformalized-KANs, a framework that integrates ensemble KANs with conformal prediction to generate calibrated prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. The ensemble approach provides a heuristic measure of uncertainty, which is then refined using split conformal prediction to ensure robust prediction intervals without relying on distributional assumptions. The method is tested on KANs, Finite Basis KANs (FBKANs), and Multi-Fidelity KANs (MFKANs) across various problems, including 1-D and 2-D functions, multi-fidelity problems, and PDEs.

## Method Summary
Conformalized-KANs combines ensemble KANs with split conformal prediction to provide guaranteed coverage. Multiple KAN models are trained independently from different random seeds, and their prediction variance serves as a heuristic uncertainty measure. A held-out calibration set is then used to compute nonconformity scores (residuals normalized by ensemble standard deviation), from which an empirical quantile determines a scaling factor that adjusts prediction interval widths. The method is applied to standard KANs, FBKANs (with domain decomposition), and MFKANs across four benchmark problems. The architecture includes a base KAN learner, an ensemble uncertainty engine, a conformal calibration module, and an inference interface that generates final intervals.

## Key Results
- Conformalized-KANs achieves the target 95% coverage across all test problems, significantly improving reliability over standard ensemble methods
- FBKANs produce narrower prediction intervals (PIW 0.09) compared to standard KANs (PIW 0.62) while maintaining coverage guarantees
- Larger ensemble sizes improve prediction accuracy and reduce PIW variance, though at increased computational cost
- The method successfully handles 1-D and 2-D functions, multi-fidelity problems, and PDE applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Ensemble of KAN models provides heuristic uncertainty by capturing model variance across different random initializations. Multiple KAN models trained independently from different random seeds have their prediction standard deviation serve as a proxy for uncertainty (1.96-sigma prediction interval). Assumes variance across models reflects true epistemic uncertainty and errors are approximately normal. Evidence shows ensemble variance enhances interpretability and robustness. Break condition: If ensemble members collapse to similar incorrect solutions, heuristic uncertainty will be overconfident and fail to cover true value.

### Mechanism 2
Split conformal prediction converts ensemble heuristic uncertainty into rigorous prediction intervals with statistical coverage guarantees. A held-out calibration dataset computes nonconformity scores (residuals normalized by ensemble standard deviation), and the quantile of these scores determines a scaling factor that adjusts prediction interval width. Assumes calibration data is exchangeable with test data. Evidence shows this integration generates calibrated prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. Break condition: If calibration set is not representative of test distribution, coverage guarantee is void.

### Mechanism 3
Domain decomposition in FBKANs produces narrower, more efficient prediction intervals than standard KANs while maintaining coverage. The domain is divided into overlapping subdomains with partition of unity functions, and local KANs are trained in parallel. This limits error reach and allows tighter local approximations, reducing overall uncertainty magnitude. Assumes function can be well-approximated by localized basis functions and partition of unity correctly combines local solutions. Evidence shows FBKAN intervals are significantly narrower than standard KAN intervals. Break condition: If overlapping regions or partition of unity functions are poorly designed, artifacts at domain boundaries could artificially inflate local uncertainty or introduce bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem**
  - Why needed: KANs are built on this theorem, representing multivariate functions as sums of univariate functions, defining their unique architecture (learnable edges, not fixed weights)
  - Quick check: Can you explain why a KAN places learnable functions on edges rather than nodes?

- **Concept: Split Conformal Prediction**
  - Why needed: This is the core UQ engine. Must understand the role of the calibration set and how the quantile transforms standard deviation into guaranteed interval
  - Quick check: If you have a calibration set of size n=100, how do you compute the quantile needed for a 95% coverage interval?

- **Concept: Domain Decomposition (Partition of Unity)**
  - Why needed: Essential for understanding FBKANs and why they outperform standard KANs in efficiency
  - Quick check: How does the partition of unity property (sum of weights equals 1) ensure local subdomain solutions combine into valid global solution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Base Learner (KAN/FBKAN/MFKAN) -> Uncertainty Engine (Ensemble) -> Calibration Module (Conformal Prediction) -> Inference Interface (Final Interval Generator)
- **Critical path:** 1) Train ensemble of KANs (M models) 2) Compute nonconformity scores on calibration data: s_j = |f(x_j) - μ_M(x_j)| / σ_M(x_j) 3) Compute quantile q̂_α 4) Apply to test data
- **Design tradeoffs:** KAN vs FBKAN (FBKAN requires more hyperparameters but yields tighter intervals), Ensemble Size M (larger improves accuracy but increases cost), Calibration Size (small sets lead to coverage fluctuations)
- **Failure signatures:** Low Coverage (Ensemble only - remedy: apply conformal calibration), Over-wide Intervals (if σ_M is systematically large), Under-wide Intervals (Conformal - only if calibration set is too small or non-exchangeable)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) 1-D Function Sanity Check - train small ensemble (M=4) on f(x) = exp(sin(0.3πx²)), verify coverage jumps from ~88% to ~96% 2) FBKAN Domain Test - compare standard KAN vs FBKAN on 2-D function, check Average PIW drops significantly for FBKAN while coverage remains ~95% 3) Calibration Sensitivity - on PDE problem, vary calibration set size, observe variance in coverage for small sets (stabilizing as size increases)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can adaptive subdomain partitioning strategies based on local uncertainty metrics yield sharper prediction intervals than the fixed decomposition used in current Conformalized-FBKANs? The conclusion states future work could incorporate adaptive subdomain partitioning strategies, allowing the model to dynamically adjust subdomain boundaries based on local uncertainty. This is unresolved because current FBKAN implementation relies on fixed user-defined subdomains which may not optimally align with regions of high error or uncertainty in complex functions. Evidence would be a comparative study where Conformalized-FBKANs with adaptive boundaries demonstrate statistically narrower PIW while maintaining target 95% coverage compared to fixed-boundary baseline.

### Open Question 2
Do adaptive calibration sets or other advanced conformal prediction techniques improve flexibility and computational efficiency of Conformalized-KANs over standard split conformal method? The authors propose that exploring advanced conformal prediction techniques, such as adaptive calibration sets, could enhance both flexibility and efficiency of UQ. This is unresolved because the paper utilizes split conformal prediction which requires holding out a fixed calibration set, may be inefficient with limited training data, and lacks flexibility to adapt to changing data distributions online. Evidence would be experiments demonstrating adaptive approach maintains valid coverage with smaller calibration footprint or better handles streaming data without retraining.

### Open Question 3
How robust are Conformalized-KANs to violations of the exchangeability assumption, specifically in time-dependent or chaotic systems where calibration and test distributions differ? The methodology explicitly requires calibration dataset must be exchangeable to guarantee coverage, but numerical experiments test generalization primarily within trained spatiotemporal domain rather than under significant temporal distribution shift. This is unresolved because in scientific ML, test points often lie outside training/calibration distribution (extrapolation), and standard conformal prediction guarantees degrade if exchangeability assumption is violated by such shifts. Evidence would be application to chaotic system (e.g., Lorenz) or long-time integration task to see if 95% coverage guarantee holds when test data evolves far beyond calibration data.

## Limitations
- Method inherits scalability challenges of ensemble KANs, requiring multiple independent trainings with no parameter sharing
- Coverage guarantees rely critically on i.i.d. assumption for calibration set; paper does not address distribution shift scenarios
- Ensemble variance as proxy for uncertainty assumes reasonable diversity among models, which may not hold with limited data or poor optimization landscapes

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Split conformal prediction mechanism is well-established and mathematically sound. Calibration procedure and coverage guarantees are standard results.
- **Medium Confidence:** Ensemble-based uncertainty heuristic works well in practice but depends on model diversity assumptions not rigorously validated in paper.
- **Medium Confidence:** Claim that FBKANs produce narrower intervals while maintaining coverage is supported by experiments, but underlying mechanism could benefit from more theoretical analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Test method under distribution shift by evaluating coverage when calibration and test data come from slightly different distributions
2. Systematically vary ensemble size M and measure trade-off between PIW reduction and computational cost
3. Compare Conformalized-KANs against alternative UQ methods (e.g., SVGP KAN) on same benchmark problems to quantify relative performance
