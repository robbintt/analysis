# GEGO: A Hybrid Golden Eagle and Genetic Optimization Algorithm for Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning in Resource-Constrained Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14672
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14672
- Reference count: 24
- Hybrid metaheuristic combining Golden Eagle Optimization and genetic operators for hyperparameter tuning

## Executive Summary
GEGO introduces a hybrid metaheuristic that merges Golden Eagle Optimization with genetic operators to improve population diversity and reduce premature convergence in optimization tasks. The algorithm integrates genetic operations (selection, crossover, mutation) directly into the iterative GEO search process rather than as a separate stage, achieving better balance between exploration and exploitation. Evaluated on CEC2017 benchmark functions and applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on MNIST, GEGO consistently outperformed standard metaheuristics in solution quality and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency under resource constraints.

## Method Summary
GEGO combines Golden Eagle Optimization (GEO) with genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation) to create a hybrid metaheuristic that improves population diversity and reduces premature convergence. The algorithm embeds genetic operations directly into the iterative GEO search process rather than treating them as separate stages, which balances exploration and exploitation capabilities. This integration allows GEGO to maintain diversity in the search population while efficiently converging toward optimal solutions. The approach was evaluated on CEC2017 benchmark functions and applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset.

## Key Results
- GEGO consistently outperformed GEO, Genetic Algorithm, and other classical metaheuristics on CEC2017 benchmark functions in terms of solution quality and robustness
- Applied to MNIST hyperparameter tuning, GEGO achieved 97.90% classification accuracy with more stable convergence than competing methods
- Demonstrated effectiveness in handling complex, high-dimensional optimization tasks under constrained computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GEGO works by integrating genetic operators directly into the GEO search process, which addresses GEO's tendency toward premature convergence by maintaining population diversity throughout the optimization. The genetic operations (selection, crossover, mutation) are embedded within each iteration of the GEO algorithm rather than applied as a separate phase, creating a more dynamic balance between exploration of the search space and exploitation of promising regions. This hybrid approach leverages GEO's efficient search patterns while using genetic mechanisms to prevent stagnation in local optima, resulting in improved solution quality and robustness across benchmark functions and practical applications like neural network hyperparameter tuning.

## Foundational Learning
- Golden Eagle Optimization (GEO) principles: Required to understand the baseline algorithm being enhanced; quick check: GEO's position update equations and search patterns
- Genetic algorithm operators (selection, crossover, mutation): Essential for understanding how diversity is maintained; quick check: implementation details of each operator in the hybrid context
- Benchmark function testing methodology: Needed to evaluate optimization algorithm performance; quick check: CEC2017 test suite characteristics and evaluation metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning in neural networks: Important for practical application context; quick check: common hyperparameters and their impact on model performance

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input -> GEO search loop -> Genetic operations -> Position update -> Output

**Critical path:** The core optimization loop integrates GEO's position update equations with genetic operators at each iteration, where candidate solutions are selected, crossed over, and mutated before updating their positions based on both GEO's exploration patterns and genetic diversity maintenance.

**Design tradeoffs:** The integration of genetic operations within GEO iterations increases computational overhead per iteration but reduces the total number of iterations needed for convergence, trading per-iteration cost for overall efficiency. This approach sacrifices some of GEO's pure exploration capability for improved exploitation through genetic diversity maintenance.

**Failure signatures:** Premature convergence despite genetic operations suggests insufficient mutation rates or ineffective crossover strategies; poor exploration indicates genetic operations are too aggressive, causing the population to lose GEO's directed search advantage; computational inefficiency suggests the genetic operators are too complex for the problem scale.

**First experiments:** 1) Run GEGO on simple CEC2017 unimodal functions to verify basic functionality; 2) Compare convergence curves of GEGO vs pure GEO on multimodal functions to assess diversity maintenance; 3) Test different rates of genetic operator application within GEO iterations to optimize the exploration-exploitation balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited benchmark scope restricted to CEC2017 functions without testing on real-world engineering or multi-objective optimization scenarios
- Comparison limited to standard metaheuristics without including recent hybrid or adaptive optimization methods that could provide stronger baselines
- Claims of computational efficiency under resource constraints lack quantitative runtime and memory usage comparisons against competing algorithms

## Confidence
- Algorithmic integration concept: High confidence in the correctness of combining GEO with genetic operators
- Computational efficiency claims: Low confidence due to lack of quantitative runtime and memory comparisons
- Scalability to large search spaces: Low confidence based on limited problem scope testing

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark GEGO against modern adaptive and ensemble-based optimizers on high-dimensional, noisy, or multi-objective problems to establish relative performance
2. Conduct empirical runtime and memory profiling to quantify efficiency gains in constrained-resource settings with concrete measurements
3. Validate hyperparameter optimization performance on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) to assess scalability beyond MNIST
