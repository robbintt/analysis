# AI Safety vs. AI Security: Demystifying the Distinction and Boundaries

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.18932
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18932
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Clarifies the fundamental distinction between AI Safety (unintentional harm prevention) and AI Security (intentional adversarial threat defense), while analyzing their interplay and proposing unified risk management.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a rigorous conceptual framework distinguishing AI Safety from AI Security, two terms often used interchangeably but addressing fundamentally different risk types. AI Safety focuses on preventing unintended harm from system failures, distributional shifts, or misalignment, while AI Security defends against intentional adversarial attacks targeting AI data, models, or operations. The authors analyze how security failures can cause safety failures and vice versa, creating exploitable interdependencies. They outline distinct research focuses—AI Safety emphasizes alignment, robustness, and interpretability, while AI Security focuses on adversarial defenses, data integrity, and access control. The paper uses analogies and case studies to illustrate these concepts and presents a unified framework for integrated risk management, emphasizing the need for both "safety-by-design" and "security-by-default" to build truly trustworthy AI systems.

## Method Summary
The paper employs theoretical analysis through systematic literature review, definition construction, analogy development, and case study illustration across three domains (Healthcare AI, Autonomous Vehicles, LLM Chatbots). The method involves mapping 40 literature references to the proposed intent-based taxonomy, validating definitions through real-world incident classification, and applying the unified risk management framework to existing AI systems. The approach is primarily conceptual rather than empirical, focusing on establishing precise terminology and relationships between safety and security domains.

## Key Results
- AI Safety and AI Security are fundamentally distinguished by the intent behind threats: unintentional system failures versus intentional adversarial attacks
- Security failures can directly cause safety incidents (e.g., prompt injection bypassing safety filters), while inherent safety flaws can become exploitable security risks (e.g., predictable biases)
- Neither safety-by-design nor security-by-default can compensate for deficiencies in the other—both are non-substitutable requirements for trustworthy AI
- The framework provides a unified approach for integrated risk management that addresses the limitations of siloed safety and security strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Intent-Based Threat Classification
- **Claim:** Classifying threats by adversarial intent enables selection of appropriate methodological "toolboxes" for mitigation
- **Mechanism:** Classifying threats as unintentional (safety—system flaws, distributional shifts, misalignment) versus intentional (security—adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model theft) maps directly to distinct defensive approaches: error-detection/alignment techniques versus cryptographic/adversarial defenses
- **Core assumption:** The origin of harm (accidental vs. deliberate) fundamentally determines which mitigation strategies will be effective
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "AI Safety focuses on preventing unintended harm from system failures, distributional shifts, or misalignment, while AI Security defends against intentional adversarial attacks"; [section 4.1] "The primary distinction between AI Safety and AI Security lies in the origin and nature of the risk"

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Domain Vulnerability Propagation
- **Claim:** Weaknesses in one domain can cascade into failures in the other through exploitable interdependencies
- **Mechanism:** Security breaches directly cause safety failures (e.g., prompt injection bypassing safety filters causes harmful outputs); conversely, safety flaws create attack surfaces (e.g., predictable biases enable targeted manipulation)
- **Core assumption:** Safety mechanisms themselves are valid targets for adversarial subversion, requiring security protection
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.2] "Security failures can directly cause safety incidents. An attacker hijacking an autonomous vehicle (security breach) can cause a crash (safety failure)"

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Pillar Necessity for Trustworthiness
- **Claim:** Truly trustworthy AI requires both intrinsic safety-by-design AND protective security-by-default; neither compensates for deficiencies in the other
- **Mechanism:** Safety ensures the system behaves as intended under uncertainty; security protects those very mechanisms from adversarial tampering
- **Core assumption:** Both dimensions are necessary and partially independent—alignment cannot prevent hacking, and encryption cannot prevent misalignment
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 5.3] "Neither dimension can compensate for deficiencies in the other. A structurally sound building (safe) remains vulnerable to burglary (insecure)"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**
  - **Why needed here:** AI Security is framed around defending these three properties against adversarial threats; understanding them is prerequisite to grasping what "security" protects
  - **Quick check question:** Why is training data poisoning classified as an attack on "integrity" specifically?

- **Concept: Distributional Shift / Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Robustness**
  - **Why needed here:** A core safety concern is system failure when deployment data differs from training data—this is non-adversarial but potentially catastrophic
  - **Quick check question:** If an AI fails on novel inputs, is this a safety or security failure? Why?

- **Concept: Value/Goal Alignment**
  - **Why needed here:** Alignment is positioned as the central safety challenge—ensuring AI systems pursue intended rather than literally-specified objectives
  - **Quick check question:** Can a system be perfectly aligned but still insecure? Give an example.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Trustworthy AI System
  ├── Safety Layer (Intrinsic, Design-Time)
  │   ├── Alignment mechanisms (RLHF, Constitutional AI)
  │   ├── Robustness to distributional shifts
  │   ├── Fail-safes and interruptibility
  │   └── Interpretability tools (LIME, SHAP)
  └── Security Layer (Protective, Runtime)
      ├── Access control and authentication
      ├── Adversarial robustness (adversarial training, input sanitization)
      ├── Data integrity validation
      ├── Model protection (watermarking, extraction defense)
      └── Incident monitoring and response
  ```

- **Critical path:**
  1. Define threat model for your deployment context (classify each risk as safety, security, or hybrid)
  2. Identify safety-critical failure modes and their causes (alignment gaps, OOD vulnerabilities)
  3. Identify security-critical attack surfaces (model weights, training data, inference API)
  4. Map cross-dependencies (which safety mechanisms depend on security protection?)
  5. Implement dual-monitoring for safety anomalies AND security compromise indicators

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Transparency (for safety debugging) vs. vulnerability disclosure (security risk)
  - Adversarial training robustness vs. benign accuracy/fairness on clean inputs
  - Fail-safe accessibility vs. tamper-proofing requirements
  - Interpretability vs. protection against model extraction attacks

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Safety-only failure: Model hallucinates incorrect medical advice under normal use (no adversary involved)
  - Security-causing-safety failure: Prompt injection bypasses content filters, enabling harmful output
  - Safety-enabling-security attack: Predictable model biases exploited for targeted manipulation campaigns
  - Adversarial cycle: Safety patch inadvertently introduces new security bypass vector

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Threat Classification Audit:** Review 10 documented AI incidents; classify each as safety, security, or hybrid; verify the applied mitigation matched the classification
  2. **Cross-Dependency Trace:** For a deployed system, map how one security breach (e.g., prompt injection) could invalidate multiple safety mechanisms; identify protection chokepoints
  3. **Integrated Metrics Dashboard:** Design monitoring that tracks safety metrics (OOD confidence scores, alignment drift indicators) and security metrics (authentication failures, input anomaly rates) with cross-domain alert escalation rules

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can researchers formally quantify and optimize the trade-offs where safety mechanisms (like increased transparency) degrade security (by revealing vulnerabilities), or where security measures negatively impact safety metrics (like accuracy or fairness)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.2 explicitly identifies "Tensions, Trade-offs, and Synergies," noting that "Aggressive adversarial training for security might reduce model accuracy or fairness on benign inputs (safety concerns)."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies that these tensions exist and that synergies are possible, but it does not provide a methodology for resolving the conflicts or measuring the "exchange rate" between safety and security utility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A mathematical framework or benchmark suite that simultaneously evaluates safety and security performance to identify Pareto-optimal system configurations.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What specific architectural patterns and organizational workflows are necessary to operationalize "co-design principles" that effectively integrate safety-by-design and security-by-default into a unified lifecycle?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7 lists "Co-Design Principles" as a key pillar for unified risk management, advocating for embedding both considerations from the outset.
- **Why unresolved:** While the authors advocate for this convergence, they note it requires moving beyond siloed approaches; specific, validated methods for this cross-functional integration remain undefined in the current literature.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A validated software development lifecycle (SDLC) model or reference architecture that demonstrably reduces both unintentional harm and adversarial exploitability compared to sequential safety-then-security reviews.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can system architects break the "adversarial cycle" where a patch for a safety flaw (e.g., an alignment error) inadvertently introduces a new security vulnerability (e.g., a subtle bypass for prompt injection)?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 4.2 describes the "Adversarial Cycle and Feedback Loops," noting that "a subsequent patch or safety fix might then inadvertently introduce... different security vulnerabilities."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper describes this dynamic as necessitating "ongoing, adaptive risk management" but does not propose technical solutions to predict or prevent the introduction of cross-domain bugs during the patching process.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** The development of formal verification tools or regression testing suites capable of analyzing safety patches for security risks (and vice versa) prior to deployment.

## Limitations
- The intent-based classification framework may break down for complex misuse scenarios where adversarial and non-adversarial factors are entangled
- Limited empirical validation of cross-domain vulnerability propagation mechanisms; most claims are theoretical
- No operational metrics provided to measure whether systems achieve "safety-by-design" and "security-by-default" thresholds

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Fundamental distinction between unintentional vs. intentional threats as valid organizing principle
- **Medium confidence:** Bidirectional relationship claims (security failures causing safety failures and vice versa)
- **Medium confidence:** Assertion that both dimensions are non-substitutable requirements for trustworthiness
- **Low confidence:** Framework's scalability to novel AI applications beyond the three case study domains

## Next Checks
1. **Threat Classification Validation:** Collect 20 documented AI incidents from diverse domains and classify each using the intent-based framework; measure inter-rater reliability and identify edge cases where classification is ambiguous
2. **Cross-Dependency Testing:** Select an existing deployed AI system and conduct a red-team exercise to demonstrate specific security breaches that cause safety failures and safety flaws that enable security attacks
3. **Framework Application Audit:** Apply the unified risk management framework to 3 different AI systems (e.g., an LLM, autonomous vehicle system, and medical diagnostic AI) and document gaps between theoretical recommendations and practical implementation constraints
