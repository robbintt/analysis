# Evaluating LLM-based Agents for Multi-Turn Conversations: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.22458
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22458
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Systematically reviews evaluation methods for LLM-based agents in multi-turn conversational settings using a PRISMA-inspired framework to analyze nearly 250 scholarly sources and develop two interrelated taxonomy systems.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM-based agents in multi-turn conversational settings. Using a PRISMA-inspired methodology, the authors analyzed nearly 250 scholarly sources to develop two interrelated taxonomy systems: one defining what to evaluate (task completion, response quality, user experience, memory and context retention, planning and tool integration) and another explaining how to evaluate (annotation-based evaluations, automated metrics, hybrid strategies, self-judging methods). The study captures both traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE scores and advanced techniques reflecting the dynamic nature of multi-turn dialogues, proposing future directions including scalable real-time evaluation pipelines and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a PRISMA-inspired framework to systematically review evaluation methods for LLM-based conversational agents. They conducted comprehensive searches across Google Scholar and major AI conferences (ICLR, NeurIPS, AAAI, NAACL, EMNLP, ACL) covering 2017-2025, using keyword-based searches followed by duplicate removal and exclusion screening. The analysis yielded a qualitative synthesis resulting in two interrelated taxonomy systems that categorize evaluation goals and methodologies for multi-turn conversational agents.

## Key Results
- Developed dual taxonomy systems separating "what to evaluate" (four agent components) from "how to evaluate" (four methodological approaches)
- Identified key components of LLM-based agents including end-to-end experience, action/tool-use, memory systems, and planning capabilities
- Proposed future directions including scalable real-time evaluation pipelines, enhanced privacy-preserving mechanisms, and robust metrics capturing dynamic multi-turn interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A dual-taxonomy framework separating evaluation goals ("what") from evaluation methods ("how") enables systematic assessment of LLM-based conversational agents that would otherwise be evaluated inconsistently.
- Mechanism: The "what" taxonomy decomposes agent capabilities into discrete, measurable components (end-to-end experience, action/tool-use, memory, planner), while the "how" taxonomy maps appropriate evaluation methodologies to each component based on their characteristics.
- Core assumption: Agent performance can be meaningfully decomposed into independent components that can be evaluated separately and then combined for holistic assessment.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "developing two interrelated taxonomy systems: one that defines what to evaluate and another that explains how to evaluate"; [section 2] "we categorize evaluation goals into four interconnected areas, following a logical workflow"; Limited direct validation; neighbor paper "Evaluation and Benchmarking of LLM Agents: A Survey" (arXiv:2507.21504) proposes similar two-dimensional taxonomy structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Annotation-free evaluation methods (LLM-as-Judge, point-wise/pair-wise scoring) can scale evaluation while reducing human annotation costs, though with reliability trade-offs.
- Mechanism: LLMs evaluate responses using predefined criteria without requiring ground-truth labels; point-wise methods score individual responses while pair-wise methods compare multiple candidates, reducing subjectivity through relative judgments.
- Core assumption: LLM evaluators can approximate human judgment quality across diverse conversational contexts and quality dimensions.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2.2] "annotation-free methods, such as point-wise scoring and side-by-side comparison, reducing dependence on manual evaluation"; [section 3.2.2] "While not perfect, these learned models have proven to correlate well with aggregate human judgments in many settings"; Weak direct evidence; no neighbor papers explicitly validate annotation-free vs annotation-based trade-offs for multi-turn conversations specifically.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-turn context retention requires separate evaluation of memory spans (turn-level, conversation-level, permanent) and memory forms (textual vs parametric) because context failure modes differ across temporal horizons.
- Mechanism: Short-term memory (turn-level) is evaluated via immediate context usage accuracy; conversation-level memory requires tracking user preferences and details over extended dialogues; permanent memory assesses cross-session retention. Textual forms preserve explicit history while parametric forms encode information in model weights, each with distinct retrieval properties.
- Core assumption: Memory failures manifest differently across temporal scales and can be diagnosed through targeted benchmarks at each level.
- Evidence anchors: [section 2.3.1] "evaluating memory spans in LLM agents requires assessing how effectively they retain and utilize information across turn, conversational, and permanent memory"; [section 2.3.2] "The architectural choice of memory representation fundamentally determines an agent's capacity for context retention, retrieval efficiency, and adaptability"; Neighbor paper "T1: A Tool-Oriented Conversational Dataset" (arXiv:2505.16986) addresses tool-call dependencies in multi-turn planning but doesn't specifically validate the memory span/form taxonomy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-turn vs Single-turn Evaluation Differences**
  - Why needed here: The paper assumes readers understand that multi-turn evaluation requires assessing interaction patterns (recollection, expansion, refinement, follow-up), error propagation, and context drift—challenges absent in single-turn settings. Without this, the taxonomy's emphasis on components like memory and planning will seem unnecessarily complex.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why BLEU score on individual responses fails to capture whether an agent maintains coherent persona across 10+ conversation turns?

- Concept: **Agent Components Beyond Core LLM**
  - Why needed here: The framework evaluates not just language generation but planning (task modeling, decomposition), memory systems (multiple spans and forms), and tool integration. Readers must distinguish between evaluating "the LLM" versus evaluating "the agent system" built around the LLM.
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between evaluating an LLM's ability to generate coherent text versus evaluating an agent's ability to decompose a multi-step task, track progress, and adapt when a tool call fails?

- Concept: **Annotation-based vs Annotation-free Trade-offs**
  - Why needed here: The paper presents these as complementary approaches with distinct cost/accuracy/scalability profiles. Implementers must understand when to invest in human annotation versus when LLM-based evaluation suffices.
  - Quick check question: If you're evaluating whether an agent correctly follows a complex API specification across multiple turns, would you choose annotation-based or annotation-free methods—and what's the key trade-off you're accepting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Evaluation Target (What) -> End-to-end Experience, Action/Tool-Use, Memory, Planner
  Evaluation Method (How) -> Data Generation, Data Annotation, Metrics
  Metrics -> Annotation-based, Annotation-free

- Critical path:
  1. Define evaluation scope: Select which agent components to evaluate based on application requirements
  2. Choose evaluation methodology: Annotation-based for high-precision tasks with clear ground truth; annotation-free for open-ended qualities or when scaling across many domains
  3. Select or construct benchmarks: Map components to existing datasets or generate custom conversation data
  4. Implement evaluation pipeline: Set up metrics collection, establish baseline performance, and create feedback loops for iterative improvement

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs Depth: Comprehensive evaluation across all four components provides holistic view but increases cost; focused evaluation on critical components is faster but may miss emergent issues at component boundaries
  - Static vs Dynamic Benchmarks: Static benchmarks enable reproducible comparisons but may not capture evolving user needs; dynamic/real-time evaluation better reflects production but introduces variance
  - Automated vs Human-in-Loop: Fully automated evaluation scales but may miss nuanced failures; human evaluation provides ground truth but limits throughput

- Failure signatures:
  - High task completion, low user satisfaction: Agent completes technical requirements but responses feel robotic or fail to acknowledge user frustration
  - Strong single-turn performance, poor multi-turn coherence: Individual responses are appropriate but conversation drifts or contradicts earlier context
  - Good evaluation scores, poor real-world performance: Benchmark results don't correlate with user metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline assessment: Run existing agent through MT-Bench and ToolBench to establish current performance across evaluation dimensions
  2. Ablation study: Systematically disable one component at a time and measure impact on evaluation metrics to validate component importance claims
  3. Methodology comparison: Evaluate same agent trajectories using both annotation-based and annotation-free methods; analyze correlation to understand whether cheaper annotation-free evaluation is viable for your use case

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can evaluation frameworks transition from assessing conversation turns in isolation to dynamically adapting to context variations over extended multi-turn interactions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state that "current evaluation methods tend to assess conversation turns in isolation" and call for "adaptive metrics that can dynamically adjust to variations in context."
- **Why unresolved:** Existing metrics fail to capture the holistic, dynamic interplay between turns in long-term dialogues.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A new metric suite that demonstrates higher correlation with human judgment on full-session quality rather than just turn-level accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can test-time evaluation strategies be integrated into LLM-based agents to allow for real-time self-assessment of coherence, factual accuracy, and context alignment?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note that "LLM-based agents generate responses without the capacity to evaluate the quality of their outputs in real time" and propose integrating "test-time evaluation strategies."
- **Why unresolved:** Agents currently lack inline mechanisms to correct errors or evaluate output quality during inference, leading to error propagation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An agent architecture featuring a real-time feedback loop that demonstrates reduced error propagation and higher coherence in long conversations without external intervention.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What methodologies can be developed to evaluate multi-turn conversation quality while preserving user privacy using techniques like Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) or federated learning?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper highlights the risk of exposing sensitive data and calls for methods "to evaluate conversation quality in a privacy-preserving manner by incorporating techniques such as Trusted Execution Environment [and] federated learning."
- **Why unresolved:** Current evaluation methods typically require access to raw conversation logs, creating privacy risks that prevent deployment in sensitive domains.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A privacy-preserving evaluation protocol that achieves comparable performance metrics to standard log-analysis methods without decrypting or centralizing raw user data.

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation for key framework claims, particularly whether component-wise evaluation captures holistic agent performance
- Insufficient analysis of how to weight or reconcile contradictory results across evaluation dimensions
- No systematic assessment of LLM-as-Judge reliability across different conversational domains and quality dimensions

## Confidence

- **Confidence is High** in the taxonomy construction methodology given the systematic PRISMA-inspired approach and clear classification criteria
- **Confidence is Medium** in the comprehensiveness of evaluation method coverage, as the search strategy details (Boolean logic, exclusion thresholds) are underspecified, making exact reproduction challenging
- **Confidence is Low** in the validation of annotation-free evaluation reliability since the paper doesn't directly compare annotation-based versus annotation-free outcomes across the same agent benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the taxonomy coverage by mapping 50 randomly selected papers from the target venues to verify the "What" and "How" categories capture the current state of the art without significant gaps

2. Conduct an ablation study comparing annotation-based and annotation-free evaluation results on the same agent trajectories to quantify correlation and identify failure modes

3. Perform a real-world deployment study measuring whether benchmark-based evaluation scores predict actual user satisfaction and task completion metrics in production settings
