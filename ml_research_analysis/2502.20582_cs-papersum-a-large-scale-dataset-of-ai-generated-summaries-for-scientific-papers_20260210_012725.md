# CS-PaperSum: A Large-Scale Dataset of AI-Generated Summaries for Scientific Papers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2502.20582
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20582
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** 91,919 computer science papers with AI-generated structured summaries covering 31 top-tier conferences from 2017-2024, validated through embedding alignment and keyword overlap analysis.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CS-PaperSum, a large-scale dataset of 91,919 computer science papers enriched with AI-generated structured summaries. The dataset covers 31 top-tier conferences from 2017-2024, with ChatGPT-generated summaries capturing key contributions, methodologies, and future research directions. Quality assessment using embedding alignment analysis and keyword overlap analysis demonstrates strong semantic preservation, with high overlap percentages particularly in AI and NLP conferences. The dataset enables automated literature analysis, research trend forecasting, and AI-driven scientific discovery, providing a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers.

## Method Summary
CS-PaperSum was constructed by collecting papers from 31 top-tier computer science conferences (2017-2024) via Semantic Scholar API, parsing PDFs with GROBID to extract conclusion sections, and generating structured summaries using GPT-3.5 with a fixed prompt template. The quality validation employed SciBERT embeddings to measure semantic alignment between original papers and summaries, visualized via t-SNE, along with KeyBERT keyword overlap analysis. The dataset includes metadata such as title, authors, conference, year, abstract, and citation count for each paper.

## Key Results
- High semantic alignment between ChatGPT-generated summaries and original papers, with conference-level clustering preserved in embedding space
- Strong keyword overlap retention (0.79-0.80) across AI, machine learning, and NLP conferences
- Dataset enables automated literature analysis, research trend forecasting, and AI-driven scientific discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Prompt-to-Summary Extraction
- Claim: GPT-3.5 can generate standardized summaries capturing contributions, methodologies, and future directions when given title, abstract, and conclusion
- Mechanism: A fixed prompt template enforces structured output fields (Key Takeaways, Importance, Model/Method, Performance, Effectiveness, Future Work), constraining generation to consistent schema across 91,919 papers
- Core assumption: The combination of title + abstract + conclusion contains sufficient signal for meaningful summarization without full-text access
- Evidence anchors: "enriched with AI-generated structured summaries using ChatGPT"; Section 4 provides explicit prompt template; related work explores similar structured extraction tasks
- Break condition: Papers with missing or malformed abstracts/conclusions will produce degraded or incomplete summaries

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Fidelity via Embedding Alignment
- Claim: Generated summaries preserve the semantic structure of original papers while maintaining domain-level distinctions
- Mechanism: SciBERT embeddings encode both original paper content and ChatGPT summaries; t-SNE visualization shows spatial alignment between each paper-summary pair while maintaining conference-level clustering
- Core assumption: SciBERT's pre-training on scientific corpora accurately captures domain semantics, and cosine/geometric proximity in embedding space reflects semantic similarity
- Evidence anchors: "The embedding analysis showed that ChatGPT-generated summaries closely align with the original papers while preserving distinct research domain structures"; Figure 3 shows t-SNE plots with summary embeddings clustering closely with original paper embeddings
- Break condition: If summaries introduce hallucinated content or omit core methodology, embedding alignment degrades

### Mechanism 3: Keyword Overlap as Concept Retention Signal
- Claim: High keyword overlap between original papers and summaries indicates effective preservation of core concepts
- Mechanism: KeyBERT extracts top-10 keywords per document based on embedding similarity to full text; Jaccard-style intersection quantifies concept retention across 31 conferences
- Core assumption: KeyBERT's extraction identifies the most salient domain concepts, and overlap percentage correlates with factual fidelity
- Evidence anchors: "Keyword overlap analysis revealed high retention of key concepts, particularly in AI, machine learning, and NLP conferences"; Figure 4 reports keyword overlap values ranging ~0.79-0.80 across venues
- Break condition: Abstract terminology not present in originals may lower overlap but not indicate quality loss

## Foundational Learning

- **Scientific Document Parsing (GROBID + Structured Extraction)**:
  - Why needed: PDFs must be converted to structured XML for reliable section extraction; conclusion identification depends on keyword heuristics
  - Quick check question: Given a PDF with non-standard section headers ("Summary and Future Directions" vs. "Conclusion"), how would you modify GROBID extraction logic?

- **Domain-Specific Embedding Models (SciBERT)**:
  - Why needed: Generic embeddings may fail to capture technical semantics; SciBERT is pre-trained on 1.14M papers from Semantic Scholar
  - Quick check question: Why would BERT-base underperform SciBERT for clustering computer vision vs. NLP papers by research domain?

- **t-SNE for High-Dimensional Visualization**:
  - Why needed: Embeddings live in 768-dimensional space; t-SNE enables 2D visualization of cluster structure and alignment
  - Quick check question: What does t-SNE preserve (local vs. global structure), and how might perplexity parameter choices distort your interpretation of summary-original alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Semantic Scholar API -> Metadata + PDF retrieval -> GROBID parsing -> XML extraction -> Conclusion section extraction -> GPT-3.5 prompt construction -> Structured summary generation -> SciBERT embedding encoding -> KeyBERT keyword extraction -> t-SNE visualization -> GitHub repository storage

- **Critical path**:
  1. Fetch paper metadata and PDFs from Semantic Scholar (citation counts are time-sensitive snapshots)
  2. Parse PDFs with GROBID; extract conclusion section using last enumerated section matching "conclusion" or "discussion"
  3. Construct prompt with title + abstract + conclusion; call GPT-3.5; parse structured output
  4. Generate SciBERT embeddings for original content and summary; compute alignment; run KeyBERT for keyword overlap

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - GPT-3.5 (not GPT-4) chosen for cost efficiency at 91,919 papers—Assumption: quality difference is acceptable for trend analysis
  - Prompt uses only abstract + conclusion (not full text)—trades completeness for API token limits and processing speed
  - Keyword overlap uses top-10 keywords—balances precision with computational cost; may miss rare but important concepts

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Missing or malformed "conclusion" extraction → incomplete prompt → degraded summary quality
  - Low keyword overlap (<0.70 for AI/ML conferences) → potential hallucination or concept drift
  - t-SNE showing poor cluster separation by conference → embedding misalignment or prompt issues
  - Empty or truncated structured fields in output → prompt format parsing failure or API rate limiting

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Sample 100 papers; manually compare GPT-3.5 summaries against human-written abstracts for factual accuracy and completeness; compute precision/recall on key claims
  2. A/B test GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4 on a 500-paper subset; compare embedding alignment scores and keyword overlap to quantify quality-cost tradeoff
  3. Validate trend detection: extract top keywords by year from summaries for a single conference (e.g., NeurIPS); verify against known historical shifts (e.g., RL → GNNs → self-supervised learning) using external literature surveys

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How do the factual accuracy and coherence of LLM-generated summaries in CS-PaperSum compare to human-written abstracts?
  - Basis in paper: The authors state in the conclusion that the dataset "can serve as a benchmark for AI-driven scientific summarization, allowing comparisons between LLM-generated summaries and human-written abstracts to evaluate factual accuracy and coherence"
  - Why unresolved: The current study validates summary quality using semantic embedding alignment and keyword overlap, but it does not quantify hallucination rates or factual consistency against a human-authored ground truth
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation benchmark using CS-PaperSum that scores LLM summaries against human abstracts using metrics for factual consistency and coherence

- **Open Question 2**: Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures utilizing CS-PaperSum significantly improve performance in scientific question-answering tasks?
  - Basis in paper: The conclusion suggests that "integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) could improve AI-assisted scientific question-answering and information retrieval systems"
  - Why unresolved: While the dataset provides the structured content necessary for retrieval, the authors have not yet implemented or tested a RAG pipeline using these specific summaries to verify performance gains
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results from a RAG system built on CS-PaperSum demonstrating improved accuracy or retrieval relevance in scientific QA tasks

- **Open Question 3**: How reliable are the specific structured fields extracted by the LLM, such as "sentiments for models/techniques" and "paper influence scores"?
  - Basis in paper: The prompt template instructs the model to generate specific structured fields including "sentiments" and a "score for paper influence," but the quality assessment focuses exclusively on embedding alignment and keyword overlap of the "Key Takeaways" section
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not validate whether GPT-3.5 can accurately assess subjective or metric-based attributes like "sentiment" or "influence" (0-10) compared to human expert judgment
  - What evidence would resolve it: A correlation analysis comparing the AI-generated influence scores and sentiment labels against human expert ratings or external bibliometric indicators

## Limitations
- The dataset relies on GPT-3.5 rather than GPT-4, potentially limiting summary quality for complex technical content where deeper reasoning is required
- Embedding alignment and keyword overlap are proxy metrics that may not fully capture factual accuracy or hallucination rates
- The study uses only abstract and conclusion sections for summary generation, which may miss critical methodology details present only in full-text sections

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Dataset construction methodology and reproducibility given detailed specifications
- **Medium confidence**: Quality assessment methods (embedding alignment and keyword overlap as proxies for semantic preservation)
- **Medium confidence**: Practical utility claims, as real-world validation with researchers is not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct expert review of 100 randomly sampled summaries against original papers to measure hallucination rates and factual accuracy, comparing against human-written abstracts
2. A/B test summary quality using GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 on a 500-paper subset, measuring both embedding alignment and human-evaluated semantic completeness
3. Perform trend analysis using the dataset to detect known historical shifts in research focus (e.g., from RL to transformers in NLP), validating the dataset's utility for research trend forecasting
