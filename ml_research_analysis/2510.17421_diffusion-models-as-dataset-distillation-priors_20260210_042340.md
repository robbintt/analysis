# Diffusion Models as Dataset Distillation Priors
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.17421
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17421
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: DAP leverages diffusion models to distill compact, high-quality datasets without retraining, achieving up to 3.5% improvement over existing generative DD methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Diffusion As Priors (DAP), a novel framework that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to guide dataset distillation. By formalizing representativeness as a kernel-induced similarity measure in feature space, DAP integrates this guidance into the reverse diffusion process to distill compact, high-quality datasets. The approach eliminates the need for retraining or external representativeness constraints, leveraging the diffusion backbone as a feature extractor. Experiments on ImageNet-1K and its subsets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with up to 3.5% improvement over existing methods, while maintaining strong cross-architecture generalization and robustness.

## Method Summary
DAP introduces a framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to distill compact, high-quality datasets. The key innovation is the formalization of representativeness as a kernel-induced similarity measure in feature space, which is then integrated as guidance during the reverse diffusion process. Unlike prior generative dataset distillation methods, DAP does not require retraining or external representativeness constraints, instead exploiting the pre-trained diffusion backbone as a feature extractor. The approach is both efficient and scalable, offering a training-free solution for improving dataset distillation quality. Experiments on ImageNet-1K and its subsets show that DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 3.5% improvement over existing methods, while maintaining strong cross-architecture generalization and robustness.

## Key Results
- DAP achieves up to 3.5% improvement over existing generative DD methods on ImageNet-1K and its subsets.
- The approach maintains strong cross-architecture generalization and robustness.
- DAP offers a training-free solution for improving dataset distillation quality, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models as feature extractors.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DAP works by leveraging the pre-trained diffusion model's ability to generate diverse, high-quality samples and its rich feature space to guide dataset distillation. The kernel-induced similarity measure ensures that the distilled dataset captures the essential diversity and structure of the original data. By integrating this representativeness guidance into the reverse diffusion process, DAP can distill compact datasets that retain high fidelity to the original data distribution. The use of a pre-trained diffusion model as a feature extractor eliminates the need for retraining, making the approach both efficient and scalable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to reverse a noising process; needed for their ability to generate diverse, high-quality samples and serve as feature extractors. Quick check: Ensure the diffusion model is pre-trained on a relevant dataset.
- **Dataset Distillation**: The process of creating a small synthetic dataset that approximates the performance of a much larger dataset; needed to reduce computational and storage costs. Quick check: Verify the distilled dataset maintains performance on downstream tasks.
- **Kernel-Induced Similarity**: A measure of similarity in feature space; needed to quantify representativeness and guide the distillation process. Quick check: Confirm the kernel function captures meaningful similarities in the feature space.
- **Reverse Diffusion Process**: The denoising step in diffusion models; needed to generate samples and guide dataset distillation. Quick check: Ensure the reverse process is stable and produces high-quality samples.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using a model to extract meaningful representations from data; needed to leverage the pre-trained diffusion model's learned features. Quick check: Validate the feature space captures relevant information for the task.
- **Cross-Architecture Generalization**: The ability of a model to perform well across different architectures; needed to ensure the distilled dataset is broadly applicable. Quick check: Test the distilled dataset on multiple architectures.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Diffusion Model -> Feature Extractor -> Representativeness Guidance -> Distilled Dataset
- **Critical Path**: The reverse diffusion process guided by kernel-induced similarity measures to distill the dataset.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using a pre-trained diffusion model eliminates retraining but introduces potential bias from the original training data.
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor representativeness guidance may lead to distilled datasets that fail to capture the diversity of the original data.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Evaluate DAP on a small subset of ImageNet-1K to verify the distillation process.
  2. Compare the performance of the distilled dataset on a held-out validation set.
  3. Test the distilled dataset on a different architecture to assess cross-architecture generalization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability to significantly larger datasets remains uncertain, as experiments are limited to ImageNet-1K and its subsets.
- The reliance on a pre-trained diffusion model as a fixed feature extractor introduces potential bias from the original training data, which is not thoroughly analyzed.
- Computational overhead during the reverse diffusion process may be substantial for very large-scale applications.

## Confidence
- **High**: Core claims of performance improvements over existing generative DD methods on tested datasets, as the methodology is well-defined and results are quantitatively supported.
- **Medium**: Advantages in training-free operation and cross-architecture generalization, since these are demonstrated but not extensively ablated or compared under varying conditions.
- **Low**: Claims about robustness and scalability beyond the experimental scope, as these are largely inferred rather than directly validated.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DAP on multi-modal datasets (e.g., text-image pairs) to test cross-domain generalization.
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the impact of the diffusion backbone's pre-training data bias on distilled dataset quality.
3. Benchmark DAP's computational efficiency and memory usage on datasets larger than ImageNet-1K to assess scalability limits.
