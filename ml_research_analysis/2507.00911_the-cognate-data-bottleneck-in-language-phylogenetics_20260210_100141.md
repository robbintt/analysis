# The Cognate Data Bottleneck in Language Phylogenetics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.00911
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00911
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Key outcome:** Automated extraction of cognate data from BabelNet fails to produce sufficiently dense matrices for phylogenetic inference, with generalized quartet distances >0.4 and Pythia difficulty scores 0.620-0.926.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large-scale automated extraction of cognate character matrices from BabelNet can overcome the data bottleneck in language phylogenetics. The authors develop a pipeline that extracts synsets, automatically transcribes orthographic words to IPA, tokenizes them, and clusters cognates into binary matrices. Despite processing data for up to 132 languages, the resulting matrices are too sparse (AMC < 0.5) and noisy to support reliable phylogenetic inference. Trees inferred from these matrices show high distances from established gold standards, indicating that current automated approaches cannot generate suitable datasets for advanced phylogenetic methods.

## Method Summary
The authors query BabelNet v5.3 for synsets across 600+ languages, filter for main senses excluding named entities, and select concepts present in many languages. Orthographic words are transcribed to IPA using epitran and tokenized with ipatok. The LexStat algorithm clusters phonetic strings into cognate classes, which are encoded as binary presence/absence matrices. RAxML-NG infers phylogenetic trees from these matrices, while Pythia evaluates inference difficulty and generalized quartet distances measure consistency with Glottolog gold standard trees.

## Key Results
- Automated extraction yields matrices too sparse for complex phylogenetic models (AMC < 0.5)
- Transcription and tokenization errors reach 39.3% and 54.2% respectively
- Inferred trees show generalized quartet distances >0.4 from gold standards
- Pythia difficulty scores range from 0.620 to 0.926, indicating high inference difficulty
- Maximum of 132 languages achieved sufficient density for analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Synset-to-Matrix Pipeline (The Automated Extraction Hypothesis)
The paper tests whether BabelNet's semantic alignment can reliably map concepts to genealogical relationships. The pipeline selects synsets, normalizes orthography to IPA, clusters cognates, and encodes binary matrices. The core assumption is that synset-based parallelism provides adequate genealogical signal despite automated transcription errors.

### Mechanism 2: Signal Erosion via Error Propagation
Automated preprocessing errors compound through the pipeline: epitran transcription errors (up to 92% for some languages) → LexStat clustering artifacts → homoplasy in character matrices → high inference difficulty scores (0.6-0.9) and GQ distances >0.4.

### Mechanism 3: The Sparsity Constraint (The Data Bottleneck)
Multilingual resources cover 600+ languages but phonetic data is sparse (99.8% of synsets have IPA for <20 languages). This coverage gap prevents complex models from achieving the dense matrices (AMC > 0.85) required for reliable inference.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Cognate Classes vs. Translation Equivalents**
  - **Why needed here:** Synsets equate to concepts while cognates require shared ancestry; understanding this distinction explains why the pipeline fails when synsets link unrelated words through loanwords or semantic coincidence.
  - **Quick check question:** Can two words be in the same BabelNet synset but not be cognates? (Yes, e.g., loanwords or coincidental semantic overlap).

- **Concept: Phylogenetic Character Matrices (Binary Encoding)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper converts linguistic data into binary matrices where empty cells (missing data) reduce overlapping signal more severely than 0s (absence of a cognate class).
  - **Quick check question:** Why does an empty cell in the matrix hurt inference more than a 0? (Missing data reduces overlapping signal used to calculate tree likelihoods; absence is an informative state).

- **Concept: IPA and Sound Classes (Dolgo)**
  - **Why needed here:** Error rates are measured against dolgo sound classes rather than exact string matches to abstract away minor phonetic differences.
  - **Quick check question:** If epitran transcribes with a slight IPA error but falls into the same dolgo sound class, does it break cognate clustering? (Likely not, which is why the paper checks both raw error rates and sound class error rates).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** BabelNet API -> Epitran (transcription) -> ipatok (tokenization) -> LexStat (clustering) -> RAxML-NG (tree inference) -> Pythia (evaluation)
- **Critical path:** IPA Transcription/Tokenization step. Errors here propagate exponentially through clustering; if input IPA is garbage, cognate classes are noise, and resulting trees are random.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Quantity vs. Quality (top 5000 synsets maximizes data but includes obscure concepts prone to noise; Swadesh lists improve quality but result in tiny sparse matrices).
- **Failure signatures:** High GQ Distance (>0.4) indicates tree contradicts linguistic history; High Pythia Difficulty (>0.6) indicates insufficient phylogenetic signal; Low AMC (<0.5) indicates matrix too sparse for robust inference.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate "Dense + Epitran" extraction: Extract top 5000 synsets for dense language set, calculate AMC to verify sparsity (Target: AMC ~0.49).
  2. Reverse Engineering Test: Take NorthEuraLex subset, run through epitran+ipatok, cluster, and infer tree; compare to manual IPA tree to quantify signal loss per step.
  3. Noise Threshold Test: Introduce random noise (10%, 20%, 50%) into gold-standard matrix, run RAxML-NG, determine error rate where GQ distance exceeds 0.4.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How can complex phylogenetic models and machine learning techniques be applied to cognate data if large-scale automated dataset extraction remains infeasible? The authors demonstrate automated extraction yields data too sparse for these advanced methods, and manual data is insufficient in size.

- **Open Question 2:** Can character matrices extracted directly from sound recordings bypass the data bottleneck observed in text-based resources? The conclusion suggests investigating fundamentally distinct approaches like applying ML methods for character matrix extraction from sound recordings.

- **Open Question 3:** Can simultaneous IPA transcription and tokenization significantly reduce error rates compared to the sequential pipeline used? The authors note that carrying out both steps simultaneously could improve error metrics and improve GQ distance to gold standard trees.

## Limitations

- Gold Standard Dependency: All evaluation metrics rely on Glottolog trees as ground truth, which themselves are reconstructions with uncertainty.
- Error Measurement Methodology: Reverse engineering approach assumes NorthEuraLex IPA represents perfect ground truth, but manual transcription contains errors and biases.
- Data Sparsity Fundamental Limit: The exact threshold for "viable" matrix density remains unclear, with AMC < 0.5 used as somewhat arbitrary cutoff.

## Confidence

**High Confidence (Likelihood > 0.8):**
- Automated pipeline cannot generate matrices dense enough for complex phylogenetic models
- Current error rates in transcription and tokenization are too high for reliable inference
- Data sparsity is the primary bottleneck preventing automated approaches

**Medium Confidence (Likelihood 0.5-0.8):**
- Specific error rate thresholds (39.3% tokenization error) are representative across language pairs
- Pythia difficulty scores >0.6 definitively indicate phylogenetic noise rather than methodological limitations
- 132-language cutoff represents fundamental constraint rather than parameter choice artifact

**Low Confidence (Likelihood < 0.5):**
- Alternative clustering algorithms could significantly improve signal recovery
- Different concept selection strategies might yield better results
- Relationship between matrix density and inference quality follows predictable pattern

## Next Checks

**Check 1: Error Threshold Calibration**
Systematically vary transcription error rates in gold-standard matrix (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) and measure corresponding GQ distance and Pythia scores to establish precise error tolerance threshold.

**Check 2: Alternative Clustering Validation**
Apply multiple cognate clustering algorithms (not just LexStat) to same IPA data and compare resulting tree topologies and difficulty scores to test if clustering method is significant source of error.

**Check 3: Concept Set Optimization**
Test different concept selection strategies systematically: Swadesh-200, semantic fields, or stability-ranked concepts to measure how concept choice affects matrix density and inference quality.
