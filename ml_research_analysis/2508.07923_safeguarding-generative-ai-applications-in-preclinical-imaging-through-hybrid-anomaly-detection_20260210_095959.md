# Safeguarding Generative AI Applications in Preclinical Imaging through Hybrid Anomaly Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.07923
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07923
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Hybrid anomaly detection framework combining statistical features and CLIP embeddings for generative AI systems in preclinical imaging

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hybrid anomaly detection framework for generative AI systems in preclinical imaging, specifically for BIOEMTECH's eyes™ systems. The method combines first-order statistical features modeled with a Gaussian Mixture Model and visual-language embeddings from CLIP with Principal Component Analysis to identify out-of-distribution samples. This approach was applied to two generative models: Pose2Xray, which synthesizes X-ray images from mouse photos, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. The integration of outlier detection enabled automated flagging of erroneous predictions, reducing manual oversight, improving reliability, and supporting real-time quality control.

## Method Summary
The hybrid framework operates in two parallel branches. The first branch extracts first-order statistical features (entropy, median, variance, uniformity) from training images and fits a Gaussian Mixture Model to learn their probability distribution. New samples are flagged as outliers if their likelihood falls below a percentile threshold τ. The second branch uses CLIP to encode images into semantic embeddings, applies PCA to reduce dimensionality, and flags samples with high reconstruction loss (Euclidean distance between original and projected embeddings). The paper notes the thresholds are empirically chosen and requires a parameter sweep to match outlier proportions between train and test sets.

## Key Results
- Hybrid anomaly detection framework successfully flags out-of-distribution samples in preclinical imaging
- Automated flagging reduces manual oversight requirements for generative AI systems
- Framework supports real-time quality control in high-throughput preclinical imaging environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
First-order statistical features can approximate the distribution of valid preclinical images to flag pixel-level anomalies. The system extracts scalar metrics like entropy, variance, and uniformity from training images. A Gaussian Mixture Model learns the probability density of these metrics. During inference, if the likelihood of a new sample's metrics falls below a set percentile τ, it is flagged as an outlier.

### Mechanism 2
Dimensionality reduction of visual-language embeddings identifies semantic outliers that statistical features miss. The system encodes images using CLIP to capture semantic content. It then fits a Principal Component Analysis subspace on the training embeddings. Anomaly scores are calculated via reconstruction loss—the Euclidean distance between the original embedding and its projection onto the PCA subspace. High loss implies the image lies outside the learned semantic manifold.

### Mechanism 3
Hybridization lowers the manual oversight burden by filtering distinct failure modes (textural vs. semantic) in real-time. By combining a lightweight statistical filter and a semantic filter, the system acts as a gatekeeper. This automation allows the GenAI to operate in high-throughput environments without constant human verification, satisfying regulatory needs for data traceability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
  - Why needed here: Used to model the probability distribution of image statistics. You must understand how GMMs define "normality" as a likelihood surface rather than a single point.
  - Quick check question: How does a GMM handle a multi-modal distribution of "normal" images (e.g., different mouse strains) better than a single Gaussian?

- **Concept: Reconstruction Error in PCA**
  - Why needed here: This serves as the distance metric for the semantic anomaly detector.
  - Quick check question: If you retain too many principal components (high r), why would the anomaly detector fail to catch outliers?

- **Concept: Vision-Language Models (CLIP)**
  - Why needed here: Provides the semantic "embedding" of the image.
  - Quick check question: Why is CLIP used here instead of a standard ImageNet classifier for detecting out-of-distribution medical images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Image → Branch A (Feature Extractor → GMM Scorer) and Branch B (CLIP Encoder → PCA Projector → Reconstruction Loss Calculator) → Aggregator (Threshold Logic) → Pass/Fail flag

- **Critical path:** The PCA dimensionality sweep (r) is the most sensitive configuration step. If r is not tuned to match the variance of the specific preclinical dataset, the system will either flag valid scans or miss obvious anomalies.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Computing CLIP embeddings is heavier than calculating image entropy. The hybrid approach balances quick statistical checks with deeper semantic validation. High sensitivity reduces risk but increases the load on human operators.

- **Failure signatures:** High False Positive Rate likely caused by a training set that is too small or homogenous. Silent Failures occur if the anomaly is visually plausible but statistically "normal."

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Calculate the GMM likelihood for a held-out validation set vs. intentionally corrupted images to verify separation.
  2. Run the PCA reconstruction test varying r (e.g., 10, 50, 100) to find the "elbow" where valid images have low loss but "phantom" images have high loss.
  3. Measure end-to-end inference time for the OD pipeline on the target hardware to ensure it fits within the anesthesia window.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the outlier detection threshold be optimized systematically rather than empirically to balance sensitivity and specificity across different preclinical datasets? The authors state the likelihood threshold is "empirically chosen to adjust for sensitivity and specificity." Empirical selection is subjective and may not generalize well to new data distributions.

### Open Question 2
Does the hybrid combination of first-order statistical features and visual-language embeddings provide superior detection performance compared to using either modality alone? The paper introduces a hybrid framework but presents no ablation study comparing the hybrid approach to its individual components.

### Open Question 3
To what extent do pre-trained visual-language models like CLIP retain semantic sensitivity when applied to specialized, non-natural image domains like preclinical X-rays? The methodology relies on CLIP for semantic embeddings, yet preclinical imaging differs significantly from the natural image datasets used to train CLIP.

## Limitations
- Hyperparameter sensitivity: GMM components and PCA dimensionality r are empirically determined without theoretical guidance
- Hybrid integration unclear: The paper doesn't specify how the two anomaly detection methods are combined
- Real-time validation gap: No latency measurements to confirm "real-time" claims

## Confidence
- Confidence: Medium for the hybrid framework's effectiveness. Lacks quantitative validation against ground truth outlier labels.
- Confidence: Low for CLIP's domain transferability. No evidence that CLIP captures relevant semantic features in preclinical domains.
- Confidence: Low for scalability claims. Tested on small datasets (1,294-2,428 samples) without demonstration on larger industrial-scale data.

## Next Checks
1. Test CLIP embeddings on a dataset where outlier labels are known to quantify how well the semantic detector generalizes from natural to medical imaging domains.
2. Implement and test all three integration strategies (AND, OR, weighted average) on the same dataset to determine which provides optimal precision-recall tradeoff.
3. Measure end-to-end inference time and detection accuracy while scaling from the reported sample sizes to datasets 10× larger, simulating industrial deployment conditions.
