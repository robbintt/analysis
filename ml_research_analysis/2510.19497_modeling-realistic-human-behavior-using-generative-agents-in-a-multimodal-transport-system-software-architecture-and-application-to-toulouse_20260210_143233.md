## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Framework combining GAMA simulation with generative agents and GTFS data demonstrates context-aware decision-making and habit formation in multimodal transport systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for modeling realistic human mobility behavior in complex multimodal transport systems using large language models (LLMs) integrated with agent-based simulation. The proposed architecture combines the GAMA simulation platform with generative agents powered by LLMs, GTFS data for public transport, and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. In a case study of Toulouse, France, agents demonstrated context-aware decision-making and habit formation over a simulated month, with change rates decreasing over time as agents converged on stable travel routes.

The study also compared different LLM models and memory configurations, finding that longer reflection intervals improved consistency while no-memory settings achieved faster but less reliable habit formation. Computational costs remained feasible, though scalability challenges persist. The work provides a promising foundation for advancing intelligent transportation systems and personalized multimodal mobility solutions, demonstrating how generative agents can capture complex human decision-making patterns in transport planning.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates GAMA's agent-based simulation capabilities with generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs), using GTFS data for public transport and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. Agents are initialized with synthetic demographic data and make travel decisions based on their goals, context, and learned habits. The system simulates daily mobility over a month, with agents updating their preferences and routes through an iterative learning process. Memory configurations and reflection intervals are tested to evaluate their impact on habit formation and decision consistency. Computational performance is monitored to assess scalability and efficiency.

## Key Results
- Agents progressively converged on stable travel routes, with change rates decreasing over time
- Longer reflection intervals improved consistency in agent decisions
- Computational costs remained feasible, though scalability challenges persist for larger populations or extended timeframes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages generative agents to simulate human-like decision-making by integrating LLMs with agent-based modeling. Agents use contextual information, personal goals, and learned habits to make mobility choices, mimicking real-world behavior. The combination of GTFS data and OpenTripPlanner enables accurate representation of multimodal transport options, while the memory mechanism allows agents to adapt and refine their decisions over time. This approach captures the dynamic and context-dependent nature of human mobility, providing a more realistic alternative to traditional static models.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Generative agents**: AI-driven entities that simulate human-like decision-making by integrating contextual information, goals, and learned habits. Why needed: To model realistic human behavior in complex systems. Quick check: Observe if agents' decisions align with expected patterns over time.

2. **Agent-based simulation (GAMA)**: A computational method for modeling interactions between autonomous agents in a system. Why needed: To simulate the collective behavior of agents in a transport network. Quick check: Validate agent interactions and emergent patterns against real-world data.

3. **GTFS data integration**: Standardized format for public transport schedules and routes. Why needed: To provide accurate and comprehensive transport options for agents. Quick check: Ensure GTFS data covers all relevant transport modes and routes in the study area.

4. **Multimodal routing (OpenTripPlanner)**: Algorithm for calculating optimal routes across multiple transport modes. Why needed: To enable agents to make informed decisions based on available transport options. Quick check: Verify routing accuracy and efficiency for different scenarios.

5. **Memory mechanism**: A simplified model of human cognition that allows agents to learn and adapt over time. Why needed: To simulate habit formation and long-term behavioral changes. Quick check: Assess if agents' decisions stabilize as expected over the simulation period.

6. **LLM-powered decision-making**: Use of large language models to process contextual information and generate human-like responses. Why needed: To enable agents to make nuanced, context-aware decisions. Quick check: Evaluate the quality and consistency of agent decisions across different scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Synthetic data -> GAMA platform -> Generative agents -> LLMs -> GTFS data -> OpenTripPlanner -> Multimodal routing -> Agent decisions -> Habit formation

Critical path: Data initialization -> Agent decision-making -> Multimodal routing -> Habit update -> Simulation iteration

Design tradeoffs: Simplified memory model vs. computational efficiency; synthetic data vs. real-world accuracy; LLM model choice vs. decision consistency

Failure signatures: Inconsistent agent decisions; computational bottlenecks; unrealistic habit formation patterns; routing errors

First experiments:
1. Test agent decision-making with a small synthetic population to validate basic functionality.
2. Compare routing results from OpenTripPlanner with real-world travel times to ensure accuracy.
3. Evaluate memory mechanism by simulating a short timeframe and observing habit formation patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic demographic data may not fully capture real-world travel patterns, particularly for underrepresented population segments.
- Simplified memory model may not adequately represent long-term behavioral adaptation or social influences on mobility choices.
- Computational efficiency analysis is limited to a single month simulation, leaving questions about long-term scalability.
- Comparison of LLM models is limited to a small set, with unclear impact of model-specific biases on agent behavior.
- Framework dependence on GTFS data may not represent emerging mobility modes or informal transport systems.

## Confidence
High Confidence: The architectural design combining GAMA with generative agents is technically sound and the computational performance measurements are reliable within the tested parameters.

Medium Confidence: The habit formation patterns observed in agents show plausible trends, though the simplified memory model limits generalizability to real human behavior.

Low Confidence: The transferability of results to different urban contexts and the framework's ability to capture complex social influences on mobility decisions require further validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a sensitivity analysis comparing agent behavior with real-world travel survey data from Toulouse to assess model accuracy in replicating actual mobility patterns.
2. Test the framework with extended simulation periods (6-12 months) to evaluate long-term habit formation stability and computational scalability.
3. Implement and compare alternative memory architectures that incorporate social influence mechanisms to assess improvements in modeling realistic human mobility decisions.
