# Beyond Chains of Thought: Benchmarking Latent-Space Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.10615
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10615
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: GPT-4.5 achieved 74.7% accuracy on a benchmark forcing internal reasoning without explicit chains of thought

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel benchmark to evaluate whether large language models can perform reasoning internally within their latent representations, rather than relying on explicit step-by-step chains of thought. The benchmark presents problems requiring responses in a language different from both the prompt and context window, preventing surface-level heuristics and forcing multi-hop reasoning computations. Results show significant variation in model performance, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest accuracy (74.7%) while smaller models like GPT-3.5 Turbo performed poorly (21.7%). The findings suggest that some models can engage in genuine internal reasoning, with important implications for understanding model capabilities and safety considerations around covert reasoning behaviors.

## Method Summary
The benchmark consists of 4,000 items across eight reasoning categories (arithmetic, causal, logical, moral, social, spatial, temporal, and linguistic). Each item requires solving a problem and responding in a randomly selected non-English language, forcing models to override their default tendency to respond in the prompt's language. The benchmark uses fixed knowledge tasks, randomized language assignment, and strict evaluation criteria where only the first token's language determines correctness. Control experiments include a reverse condition where English responses are correct, and difficulty scaling analyzes performance degradation with more complex operands.

## Key Results
- GPT-4.5 achieved the highest accuracy at 74.7%, followed by Grok-2 (67.2%) and Llama 3.1 405B (65.6%)
- Smaller models performed significantly worse: GPT-3.5 Turbo (21.7%), Gemini 1.5 Flash (28.6%)
- Social reasoning showed the largest performance gap (GPT-4.5 at 94.6% vs. Llama 4 Maverick at 65.2%)
- Performance degrades systematically with difficulty scaling, showing 26% mean decline across models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning Compression
LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning computations within their hidden layers without emitting intermediate tokens. The benchmark requires synthesizing information across multiple reasoning steps (e.g., compute two sums → compare results → select response language) entirely within latent representations. The final hidden state must encode the computed outcome to condition the first output token's language. Break condition: Performance degrades when task difficulty exceeds latent state capacity, with difficulty scaling analysis showing mean 26% decline.

### Mechanism 2: Inhibitory Override of Language Priming
The benchmark measures genuine reasoning by forcing models to overcome their learned default to respond in the prompt's language. Models acquire a strong training-induced bias toward language matching. Successful task completion requires evaluating the conditional reasoning problem, determining the correct language, and inhibiting the automatic same-language response—functionally analogous to the human Stroop effect. Break condition: If models exploit prompt patterns as heuristics (e.g., specific phrasings triggering language shifts), high accuracy may not reflect genuine reasoning.

### Mechanism 3: Dense Architecture Advantage for Latent Computation
Dense transformer architectures exhibit stronger latent reasoning capacity than mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures with comparable or larger total parameter counts. MoE models activate only a subset of parameters per forward pass (e.g., Llama 4 Maverick's 17B active parameters), potentially limiting the computational pathways available for integrating multi-step reasoning within hidden states. Break condition: This remains a hypothesis; definitive causal attribution requires controlled studies isolating architecture from training data and other confounds.

## Foundational Learning

- **Latent Space Representations in Transformers**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that LLMs maintain internal hidden states between token predictions is essential for grasping how "reasoning leaps" occur without explicit output
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a transformer's hidden state at position n differs from the token emitted at position n?

- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark requires composing multiple reasoning operations (e.g., arithmetic + comparison + conditional selection) internally before generating any output
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes single-hop from multi-hop reasoning in terms of intermediate state dependencies?

- **Stroop Effect and Inhibitory Control**
  - Why needed here: The benchmark is explicitly modeled on the Stroop paradigm—measuring the ability to override automatic responses provides a signal of genuine computation versus pattern matching
  - Quick check question: How does the Stroop effect operationalize the difference between automatic and controlled processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Item generator -> Language assignment -> Task sampler -> Model inference -> Response classifier -> Control validation -> Statistical analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Item construction: Template -> GPT-4.5 variants -> random sampling -> language/task assignment
  2. Model inference: System prompt + item -> generation (temperature=0, max_tokens=10)
  3. Response classification: Detect first-token language -> TRUE/FALSE scoring
  4. Control validation: Reverse condition (English correct) + difficulty scaling
  5. Statistical analysis: Two-proportion z-tests for model comparisons

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multilingual output requirement enables latent reasoning measurement but excludes LRMs with English-centric thinking processes
  - max_tokens=10 prevents CoT externalization but risks truncating longer target-language responses
  - Temperature=0 ensures reproducibility but may underrepresent capability variance across sampling

- Failure signatures:
  - High accuracy with minimal difficulty-scaling degradation -> likely heuristic exploitation
  - Large performance gap between dense and MoE variants of similar size -> architecture-specific limitation
  - Consistent English responses despite correct reasoning -> failure of inhibitory override
  - Older models outperforming newer ones -> potential training regression

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Run the full benchmark (n=4,000) on a target model with the exact system prompt, temperature=0, max_tokens=10. Record per-category accuracy and compare to published baselines.
  2. **Reverse-condition control**: Run the n=800 reverse benchmark where English responses are correct. High performance here validates that models are reasoning rather than exploiting language-shift heuristics.
  3. **Difficulty-scaling probe**: Apply the arithmetic difficulty-scaling methodology with progressively larger operands. Plot rolling-average performance to identify the difficulty threshold where latent reasoning fails.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The benchmark's core assumption—that models perform genuine multi-step reasoning rather than exploiting surface heuristics—remains difficult to verify definitively
- Using 8 non-English languages (all with Latin scripts except Russian) may introduce unintended advantages or disadvantages
- Difficulty scaling shows performance degradation but the exact cognitive load at which latent reasoning fails is not precisely characterized

## Confidence
**High Confidence:**
- Model performance differences are real and reproducible
- The benchmark successfully prevents explicit chain-of-thought reasoning
- Performance varies meaningfully across reasoning categories
- Control experiments provide partial validation of the reasoning hypothesis

**Medium Confidence:**
- Dense architectures genuinely outperform MoE architectures for latent reasoning
- Models engage in multi-hop reasoning rather than simple heuristics
- Difficulty scaling meaningfully measures latent reasoning capacity

**Low Confidence:**
- The specific value of 74.7% accuracy for GPT-4.5 represents "true" reasoning capability
- All models failing below 70% lack latent reasoning ability entirely

## Next Checks
1. **Architectural Isolation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing dense vs. MoE variants with identical training data, model size, and fine-tuning procedures. Vary only the active parameter count while keeping total parameters constant to isolate the architectural effect on latent reasoning capacity.

2. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test**: Run the benchmark with all 8 languages reversed (target language becomes prompt language, English becomes response language). High accuracy across all languages would support genuine reasoning; significant performance drops for certain languages would indicate training-data bias or heuristic exploitation.

3. **Intermediate State Probing**: Use activation analysis to examine hidden state trajectories during inference. Compare the similarity of hidden states for correct vs. incorrect responses, and measure whether intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., computed sums in arithmetic problems) are encoded in the latent representations before the final output token.
