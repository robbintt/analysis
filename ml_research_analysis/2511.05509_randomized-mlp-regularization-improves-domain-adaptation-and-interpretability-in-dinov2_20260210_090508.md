# Randomized-MLP Regularization Improves Domain Adaptation and Interpretability in DINOv2

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.05509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05509
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RMLP improves downstream performance and interpretability of ViTs like DINOv2, especially in medical imaging with domain shifts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Randomized-MLP (RMLP), a regularization technique for Vision Transformers that replaces standard MLP heads with randomized operators. RMLP encourages semantically aligned representations and improves interpretability, particularly valuable in medical imaging where domain shifts can degrade performance and transparency. The method is grounded in the geometry of contrastive learning and offers theoretical insights into enhancing ViT-based models.

Experiments demonstrate that RMLPs improve or maintain downstream performance across both natural and medical image modalities, including classification and segmentation tasks. The method shows state-of-the-art segmentation performance on OCT scans and enhances interpretability by reducing attention artifacts and promoting anatomical alignment in medical images. RMLPs also generalize beyond DINOv2, improving performance when applied to SwA V trained under different self-supervised paradigms.

## Method Summary
RMLP introduces a novel regularization approach that replaces standard MLP heads in Vision Transformers with randomized operators. This modification encourages semantically aligned representations during training by leveraging the geometry of contrastive learning objectives. The randomization acts as a form of implicit regularization that prevents overfitting to specific feature representations while maintaining task-relevant information. The approach is lightweight and can be applied to existing ViT architectures with minimal modifications, making it practical for both research and production applications.

## Key Results
- RMLP achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on OCT scans and improves classification accuracy on medical datasets
- The method maintains or improves downstream performance across natural and medical image modalities
- RMLP enhances interpretability by reducing attention artifacts and promoting anatomical alignment in medical images
- The approach generalizes to other self-supervised models like SwA V, demonstrating broad applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RMLP works by introducing controlled randomness into the MLP heads of Vision Transformers, which acts as a regularizer that prevents the model from overfitting to specific feature representations. This randomization encourages the network to learn more robust, semantically meaningful representations that are less sensitive to domain shifts. By disrupting the direct mapping between intermediate features and final predictions, RMLP forces the model to develop more generalized decision boundaries that transfer better across domains. The mechanism is particularly effective in medical imaging where domain shifts are common due to variations in imaging equipment, protocols, and patient populations.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input Images -> Vision Transformer Backbone -> Randomized MLP Heads -> Output Predictions

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the forward pass through the ViT backbone followed by the randomized MLP heads. The randomization occurs within the MLP layers, modifying how features are transformed before final predictions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: RMLP trades some parameter efficiency for improved generalization and interpretability. The randomization introduces noise that can slow convergence but ultimately leads to more robust representations. The approach requires careful tuning of randomization parameters to balance regularization strength with task performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include degraded performance if randomization is too strong, difficulty in convergence during training, and reduced performance on tasks requiring precise feature localization. The method may also struggle with very small datasets where regularization could be counterproductive.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement RMLP on a standard ViT architecture and compare training curves with and without randomization
2. Evaluate RMLP on a benchmark dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) to establish baseline performance improvements
3. Apply RMLP to a simple medical imaging task (e.g., binary classification) to verify domain adaptation benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges several open questions regarding RMLP's broader applicability and theoretical foundations. While the method shows promise in medical imaging and some natural image tasks, its effectiveness across diverse domains and tasks remains to be fully explored. The theoretical insights into contrastive learning geometry are promising but require further empirical validation to establish the precise mechanisms behind RMLP's success. Additionally, the sensitivity of RMLP to hyperparameter choices and its interaction with different self-supervised learning objectives present avenues for future research.

## Limitations
- Reported performance improvements on medical datasets are modest (approximately 1-3% absolute gains), raising questions about robustness and generalizability
- Interpretability claims lack rigorous quantitative validation, relying primarily on qualitative observations
- The method's effectiveness on non-medical datasets and sensitivity to hyperparameters are not thoroughly explored
- Theoretical insights into contrastive learning geometry are not empirically validated

## Confidence
- **High**: The paper demonstrates that RMLP can be implemented and applied to ViTs like DINOv2, and it provides theoretical motivation for the approach
- **Medium**: The reported performance improvements on medical datasets are plausible but may not be consistent across all tasks or domains
- **Low**: The interpretability claims and the theoretical insights into contrastive learning geometry lack sufficient empirical support and rigorous validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of RMLP hyperparameters (e.g., randomization strength, MLP architecture) on performance and interpretability
2. Perform cross-domain evaluations to assess RMLP's robustness to domain shifts beyond medical imaging, including natural and synthetic datasets
3. Develop and apply quantitative metrics to validate the interpretability claims, such as attention map consistency, anatomical alignment scores, or human evaluation studies
