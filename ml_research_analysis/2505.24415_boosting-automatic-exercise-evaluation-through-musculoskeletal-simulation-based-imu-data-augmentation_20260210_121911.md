# Boosting Automatic Exercise Evaluation Through Musculoskeletal Simulation-Based IMU Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.24415
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24415
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: IMU data augmentation via musculoskeletal simulation significantly improves neural network classification accuracy for physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel method for augmenting IMU data using musculoskeletal simulation to address limited training data, class imbalance, and label ambiguity in automated physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation. The approach systematically modifies movement trajectories using biomechanical constraints enforced through OpenSim inverse kinematics, then automatically derives labels via threshold-optimized kinematic evaluation. Experiments across three datasets (Foot Drop, Deep Squat, Hurdle Step) demonstrate that augmented data closely resembles real data and significantly improves classification performance, particularly when combined with patient-specific fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The method converts IMU orientations to quaternions, estimates segment orientations using Madgwick filters, and augments movement data by sampling offset and scaling parameters from class-specific multivariate normal distributions in Euler angle space. Modified trajectories are validated through OpenSim inverse kinematics to ensure biomechanical plausibility, then automatically labeled using knowledge-based rules applied to kinematic parameters. A 1D CNN classifier is trained on the augmented dataset and fine-tuned with patient-specific examples.

## Key Results
- Augmented-only training (TRTR) approaches real-data performance for Foot Drop (0.958 GMF1) but shows significant degradation for Hurdle Step (0.29 macro F1)
- Patient-specific fine-tuning with as few as 2 real examples improves individual subject performance
- Cross-subject generalization remains challenging for exercises with high label ambiguity like Hurdle Step

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Enforcing biomechanical constraints via musculoskeletal simulation preserves movement plausibility during augmentation. Modified Euler angle trajectories are passed through OpenSim inverse kinematics, which computes joint poses that best fit segment orientations while adhering to predefined biomechanical constraints of a skeletal model. Core assumption: The musculoskeletal model accurately represents relevant degrees of freedom and joint limits. Break condition: If exercises require torso mobility beyond the model's limited degrees of freedom in that region, plausibility may degrade.

### Mechanism 2
Distribution-based trajectory modification generates diverse, label-controllable augmented examples. Augmentation parameters (offset β, range scaling α) are sampled from class-specific multivariate normal distributions derived from real data and expert knowledge. Sampling from same-class distributions preserves labels; sampling from different-class distributions enables cross-class synthesis. Core assumption: Movement quality variations are adequately characterized by initial posture offsets and range-of-motion scaling in Euler angle space. Break condition: If real data contains too few examples for a class, fitted distributions may not capture true variance, leading to augmented samples that diverge from real patterns.

### Mechanism 3
Inverse kinematics-derived parameters combined with threshold-optimized rules enable reliable automatic labeling. Kinematic outputs from inverse kinematics are evaluated against exercise-specific criteria. Thresholds are optimized via random search (10M combinations) to maximize geometric mean F1 against human-assigned labels. Core assumption: Exercise evaluation criteria can be translated into deterministic thresholds on kinematic parameters. Break condition: For inherently ambiguous criteria like "loses balance," deterministic thresholds cannot replicate subjective human judgment, causing systematic labeling disagreement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Quaternion representation and SLERP interpolation**
  - Why needed here: The pipeline converts IMU orientations to quaternions, augments via Euler angles, converts back, and uses SLERP for temporal normalization to 256 timesteps before neural network input.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why Euler angles are used for modification despite quaternions being the storage format?

- **Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSOCV)**
  - Why needed here: The critical evaluation metric for generalization—models must perform on unseen subjects, not just held-out repetitions from known subjects.
  - Quick check question: Why is standard k-fold cross-validation insufficient for evaluating this system?

- **Label ambiguity in functional movement assessment**
  - Why needed here: FMS scores are assigned by human raters with substantial inter-rater disagreement; understanding this explains why DS and HS show weaker results than FDE.
  - Quick check question: How does high label ambiguity affect the threshold optimization process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Preprocessing (IMU → quaternion) → Augmentation (quaternion → Euler → modify → quaternion) → Validation (IK) → Labeling (kinematic rules) → Neural network (1D CNN)
- **Critical path**: Distribution fitting from real data → trajectory modification → IK validation → automatic labeling → neural network training. Errors propagate; bad distributions yield biomechanically valid but class-inappropriate samples.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Euler angles enable intuitive physiotherapist validation but introduce gimbal-lock risk near singularities; automatic labeling scales without manual effort but achieves only 0.754–0.958 agreement with human raters depending on exercise; patient-specific fine-tuning improves individual performance but requires at least 2 real examples from the target subject.
- **Failure signatures**: TRTA scenario shows near-random performance (macro F1 0.29 for HS): augmented data has broader variance than real data; Subject 105 HS shows degradation with augmentation: augmented samples shift decision boundary away from ambiguous real labels; Class 1 HS consistently fails: only 8 real examples, distribution underspecified.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce TRTR vs TATR comparison on one dataset to validate that augmented-only training approaches real-data performance for FDE but not HS; 2) Visualize t-SNE embeddings of real vs augmented samples per class to confirm cluster overlap patterns match paper; 3) Test threshold sensitivity by perturbing optimized thresholds ±10% and measuring GMF1 change to understand labeling robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Subject-specific model scaling**: Does integrating individual anthropometric scaling of musculoskeletal models improve or degrade neural network generalization when trained on augmented IMU data? The study used generic models due to missing anthropometric data, leaving the trade-off between personalization and overfitting untested.

- **Label ambiguity management**: Can specialized methods systematically manage label ambiguity to improve classification performance in exercises with subjective evaluation criteria? The current approach enforces rigid decision boundaries that clash with high inter-rater disagreement, causing performance degradation on exercises like Hurdle Step.

- **Torso representation limitations**: Does the simplified kinematic representation of the torso limit the efficacy of this augmentation method for exercises predominantly involving trunk movements? The biomechanical model offers limited degrees of freedom in the torso region, suggesting a more detailed representation is advisable for torso-heavy exercises.

## Limitations
- Method depends on exercise-specific evaluation criteria and threshold optimization, requiring domain expertise for new exercises
- Cannot resolve inherently subjective assessment criteria, limiting performance on exercises with high inter-rater disagreement
- Musculoskeletal simulation via OpenSim adds computational overhead compared to simpler augmentation methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Biomechanical plausibility mechanism (IK constraint enforcement) is well-supported by OpenSim framework
- **Medium confidence**: Distribution-based augmentation approach is theoretically sound but performance varies significantly across exercises
- **Medium confidence**: Patient-specific fine-tuning effectiveness is demonstrated but requires at least 2 real examples from the target subject

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution fitting validation**: Compare empirical distributions of augmentation parameters across classes to ensure they capture meaningful movement quality differences rather than noise.
2. **Cross-exercise generalization**: Test whether augmentation parameters learned from one exercise can transfer to similar movement patterns in other exercises.
3. **Label stability analysis**: Systematically perturb optimized thresholds and measure impact on automatic labeling accuracy to quantify robustness to parameter variations.
