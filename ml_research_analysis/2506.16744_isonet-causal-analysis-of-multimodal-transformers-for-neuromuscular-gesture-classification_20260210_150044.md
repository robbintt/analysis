# IsoNet: Causal Analysis of Multimodal Transformers for Neuromuscular Gesture Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16744
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16744
- Reference count: 24
- This study introduces IsoNet, a causal analysis framework that reveals cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the predictive signal in multimodal gesture classification.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates multimodal sensor fusion for neuromuscular gesture classification using sEMG, accelerometer, and force data. Three transformer-based architectures are evaluated: multimodal MLP, multimodal transformer, and hierarchical transformer. The hierarchical transformer with attention-based fusion achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming single-modality baselines by 10.2% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.68% on HD-sEMG 65-Gesture datasets. To understand modality contributions, the authors introduce IsoNet, which enables selective masking of unimodal and cross-modal attention pathways, revealing that middle transformer layers are the primary integration zone and cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the predictive signal.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three architectures on two public datasets: NinaPro DB2 (sEMG + accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (HD-sEMG + force). The hierarchical transformer stacks modality-specific encoders before a shared transformer stage, achieving superior performance. IsoNet introduces a causal analysis method using attention logit masking to isolate pathway contributions, combined with a dual-head training strategy using loss annealing. The approach enables both high accuracy and interpretability by revealing which layers and modality interactions drive classification performance.

## Key Results
- Hierarchical transformer with attention-based fusion achieves 97.76% accuracy on NinaPro DB2 and 96.66% on HD-sEMG, outperforming single-modality baselines by 10.2% and 3.68% respectively
- Cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the predictive signal, with strongest contributions from middle transformer layers (L2-L4)
- IsoNet's ablation reveals that linear fusion baselines cannot compensate for limited channel count, while attention-driven fusion enables effective cross-modal integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Cross-modal attention pathways contribute a substantial but bounded portion of the predictive signal for multimodal biosignal classification.
- **Mechanism:** The IsoNet ablation selectively masks attention logits (setting query-key pairs to −∞) for cross-modal edges while preserving unimodal paths. The subsequent softmax redistributes probability mass over unmasked entries, isolating each pathway's functional contribution.
- **Core assumption:** That masking attention logits at inference time approximates the counterfactual importance of those pathways during normal operation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers."
  - [section 4, Table 3] Masking all cross-modal heads across every layer reduces mean accuracy to 0.636 (−30.4% of baseline 0.914).
  - [corpus] Weak direct corroboration; related work (TransforMerger, TinyMyo) focuses on fusion effectiveness but not causal pathway quantification.
- **Break condition:** If attention masks degrade model semantics beyond intended pathway isolation (e.g., by shifting token representations), contribution estimates may confound pathway importance with distributional shift artifacts.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Feature fusion via attention is layer-specialized, with middle layers serving as the primary integration zone.
- **Mechanism:** The hierarchical transformer stacks modality-specific encoders before a shared transformer stage. Ablations show L2–L4 are most sensitive to attention masking, while L1 and L5 exhibit redundancy.
- **Core assumption:** That layer-wise importance patterns generalize across datasets and gesture complexity levels.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The strongest contributions from middle transformer layers."
  - [section 4, Figure 5] Individual layer masking at L2–L4 causes substantial accuracy drops (L2 uni: −24.6%, L3 uni: −30.3%, L4 uni: −30.7%); L1 and L5 masking are not significant.
  - [corpus] NeuroLingua reports hierarchical temporal processing benefits for multimodal EEG/EOG, suggesting layered fusion may be broadly applicable, but without causal ablation.
- **Break condition:** If sensor modalities have radically different temporal scales or noise characteristics, optimal fusion layers may shift deeper or shallower.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** A dual-head training strategy with loss annealing stabilizes early features while creating a causal bottleneck for interpretability.
- **Mechanism:** IsoNet outputs two logits (CLS token and mean-pooled non-CLS tokens), trained with L(t) = λ(t)L_CLS + (1−λ(t))L_avg. By epoch 750 (of 2000), only the CLS head drives learning.
- **Core assumption:** That the average head provides stable feature initialization without corrupting the CLS head's causal interpretability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3] "The average head kicks off training and stabilizes features, while the CLS head provides a clean causal bottleneck for interpretability."
  - [corpus] No direct corroboration found; dual-head annealing is not discussed in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition:** If the annealing schedule is too aggressive or the CLS token fails to aggregate sufficient cross-channel information, interpretability gains may come at accuracy cost.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-head self-attention**
  - **Why needed here:** The architectures rely on attention to capture long-range token dependencies and cross-modal relationships. Understanding Q/K/V computation, softmax normalization, and head concatenation is prerequisite to interpreting IsoNet's masking intervention.
  - **Quick check question:** If you mask a subset of attention edges by setting their logits to −∞, what happens to the remaining attention weights after softmax?

- **Concept: Multimodal fusion strategies (early vs. late vs. hybrid)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly compares linear concatenation (late fusion), single-stage transformer fusion, and hierarchical transformer fusion. Understanding where and how modalities mix informs why hierarchical attention outperforms simpler baselines.
  - **Quick check question:** In the hierarchical transformer, at what point do sEMG and accelerometer tokens first share a representation space?

- **Concept: Causal intervention via masking**
  - **Why needed here:** IsoNet's core contribution is a causal analysis method. Understanding the difference between correlational feature importance and interventional pathway ablation is essential to correctly interpret the 30% cross-modal contribution claim.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does the paper mask attention logits rather than zeroing attention weights directly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input patches → modality-specific or shared embeddings → transformer encoder(s) with attention → fusion point (concatenation or hierarchical transformer) → classification head
- **Critical path:** Input patches → modality-specific or shared embeddings → transformer encoder(s) with attention → fusion point (concatenation or hierarchical transformer) → classification head
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Linear fusion (MLP):** Lowest compute, fastest inference, but cannot model cross-modal token interactions; accuracy gap of 10%+ vs. hierarchical.
  - **Single-stage transformer (MMT):** Captures intra-modality dependencies; cross-modality only via late concatenation; intermediate accuracy.
  - **Hierarchical transformer:** Highest accuracy (97%+ on both datasets), but increased parameter count and latency; cross-modal attention in second-stage transformer.
  - **IsoNet:** Adds interpretability via masking and dual-head training; training complexity higher (annealing schedule); suitable for embedded deployment due to single-pass inference.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **MLP on sparse sEMG:** Accuracy collapses to ~50% when forced to use sEMG alone (NinaPro), indicating linear fusion cannot compensate for limited channel count.
  - **Unimodal reliance in NinaPro:** ACC-only accuracy (97.19%) nearly matches multimodal (97.76%), but sEMG-only drops to 69.92%—suggesting channel dimensionality, not modality quality, drives performance.
  - **Saturation in HD-sEMG:** HD-sEMG-only (96.80%) ≈ multimodal (96.66%), indicating dense electrode grids already capture task-relevant variation; additional force modality yields marginal gains.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce unimodal vs. multimodal comparison:** Train multimodal MLP on equal-channel sEMG-sEMG, ACC-ACC, and sEMG-ACC configurations on NinaPro DB2; verify reported 11.1% multimodal advantage and check for channel-count confounds.
  2. **Ablate cross-modal attention by layer:** Implement IsoNet-style logit masking on hierarchical transformer; plot accuracy drop per layer to confirm L2–L4 as primary fusion zone.
  3. **Modality saturation test:** Train hierarchical transformer on HD-sEMG with progressively fewer channels; identify the channel count at which adding force modality transitions from negligible to meaningful accuracy gain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The assumption that masking attention logits at inference time cleanly isolates causal pathway contributions without inducing distribution shift or representational degradation
- The 30% cross-modal contribution claim conflates pathway importance with model capacity constraints and may be inflated
- Dataset-dependent results where NinaPro's sparse sEMG may underutilize multimodal fusion compared to HD-sEMG's dense electrode grid

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Layer-wise fusion specialization (L2–L4 as primary integration zone) - supported by consistent ablation patterns across datasets and intuitive alignment with hierarchical feature processing
- **Medium confidence**: 30% cross-modal contribution claim - methodologically sound but sensitive to masking procedure assumptions and dataset characteristics
- **Low confidence**: Dual-head training strategy efficacy - introduced without comparative validation or ablation against simpler alternatives

## Next Checks
1. **Distribution shift validation**: After IsoNet-style masking, compute embedding similarity (e.g., cosine distance, MMD) between masked and unmasked token representations. If distribution shift is significant, contribution estimates may conflate pathway importance with representational degradation.

2. **Alternative intervention comparison**: Replicate cross-modal contribution analysis using attention dropout (during training) and integrated gradients (post-hoc). Compare contribution estimates to assess robustness across intervention methods.

3. **Channel-count controlled ablation**: On NinaPro, train hierarchical transformer with progressively increasing sEMG channels (10→20→40) while keeping ACC fixed. Identify the channel threshold where cross-modal contribution drops below 15%, validating whether the 30% estimate reflects modality quality or channel capacity limitations.
