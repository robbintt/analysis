# Size-adaptive Hypothesis Testing for Fairness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.10586
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10586
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces size-adaptive hypothesis testing for fairness assessment that combines large-sample Wald tests with Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial inference for small intersectional groups

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a statistical framework for fairness assessment that adapts to varying subgroup sizes, addressing the brittleness of fixed-threshold methods in fairness auditing. The approach leverages asymptotic properties for large intersectional groups while employing Bayesian inference for small groups, ensuring valid uncertainty quantification across different data scales. By integrating frequentist and Bayesian methods, the framework provides robust statistical guarantees for detecting fairness violations while avoiding false alarms in sparse groups.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a hybrid statistical approach that dynamically selects between frequentist and Bayesian methods based on subgroup sample size. For large intersectional groups, it uses Wald tests with asymptotic normality assumptions. For small groups where asymptotic approximations fail, it applies Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial inference to model uncertainty. The method includes mechanisms for detecting and handling small-sample scenarios through informative priors and posterior sampling. Empirical validation demonstrates improved detection of statistically significant fairness violations while reducing false positives compared to traditional threshold-based approaches.

## Key Results
- Successfully detects statistically significant fairness violations while avoiding false alarms from sampling variability
- Provides size-adjusted confidence/credible intervals that are interpretable across varying subgroup sizes
- Demonstrates convergence to asymptotic behavior as data grows, offering principled robustness
- Validated on multiple real-world datasets including COMPAS, Adult, German Credit, and Student Performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by recognizing that fairness assessment faces a fundamental statistical challenge: different intersectional groups have vastly different sample sizes, making fixed-threshold approaches unreliable. By combining large-sample Wald tests with Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial inference, the framework adapts to the statistical power available for each group. The Bayesian component naturally handles uncertainty in small groups through posterior distributions, while the frequentist component provides efficiency for well-sampled groups. This hybrid approach ensures that statistical conclusions are appropriately calibrated to the available evidence, avoiding both under-detection in small groups and over-sensitivity to noise in sparse groups.

## Foundational Learning
- **Wald test for large samples:** Used for asymptotic inference when sample sizes are sufficient; quick check involves verifying normality assumptions hold
- **Dirichlet-multinomial distribution:** Provides conjugate prior for categorical outcomes in small samples; quick check involves confirming parameter constraints are met
- **Intersectional group analysis:** Focuses on fairness assessment across multiple protected attributes; quick check involves ensuring all relevant subgroups are properly enumerated
- **Bayesian posterior inference:** Handles uncertainty in small-sample scenarios; quick check involves convergence diagnostics for MCMC sampling
- **Type I error control:** Ensures false positive rates remain bounded; quick check involves validating significance levels under null hypotheses
- **Statistical power calibration:** Adapts detection sensitivity to available sample size; quick check involves power analysis across different group sizes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Large-sample Group → Wald Test → p-value calculation
Small-sample Group → Dirichlet-multinomial Prior → Posterior Sampling → Credible Intervals
Decision Layer → Size Threshold → Method Selection

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves first classifying each intersectional group as large or small based on sample size, then applying the appropriate statistical test (Wald or Bayesian), and finally aggregating results across groups. The size threshold selection is crucial as it determines which statistical framework applies to each group.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The main tradeoff is between statistical power and Type I error control. Larger groups benefit from efficient frequentist methods, while smaller groups require more conservative Bayesian approaches. The framework balances this by using data-driven thresholds rather than fixed cutoffs, though the choice of threshold still involves balancing sensitivity against false positives.

**Failure Signatures:**
The framework may fail when group sample sizes are near the threshold, causing inconsistent statistical behavior. Non-i.i.d. data structures within groups can violate independence assumptions, leading to Type I error inflation. The Dirichlet-multinomial assumption may not hold for highly imbalanced categorical distributions.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Simulate fairness scenarios with known violations across groups of varying sizes to assess detection accuracy
2. Test the framework on non-binary classification tasks to verify generalization beyond binary settings
3. Evaluate computational efficiency across datasets with different numbers of intersectional groups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Theoretical validity assumes i.i.d. samples within intersectional groups, which may not hold in real-world applications
- Empirical validation was limited to specific datasets and binary classification settings, raising questions about generalizability
- The asymptotic convergence rate may vary with data structure and group sparsity patterns, affecting practical performance

## Confidence

**Theoretical framework validity:** High
- The statistical foundations combining Wald tests and Dirichlet-multinomial inference are well-established

**Empirical performance across diverse datasets:** Medium
- Validation on multiple datasets provides some confidence, but broader testing is needed

**Asymptotic convergence behavior:** Medium
- Theoretical guarantees exist but practical convergence rates may vary with real data characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on non-binary classification tasks and continuous fairness metrics to verify robustness beyond the demonstrated binary case.

2. Conduct simulation studies with explicitly non-i.i.d. data structures to assess Type I error inflation under realistic dependency patterns.

3. Implement a systematic evaluation of the computational trade-offs between the Bayesian and frequentist components across varying subgroup sizes and sample complexities.
