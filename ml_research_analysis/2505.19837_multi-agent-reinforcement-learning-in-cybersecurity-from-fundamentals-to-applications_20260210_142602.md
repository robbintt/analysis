# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Cybersecurity: From Fundamentals to Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.19837
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19837
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-agent RL enables decentralized, adaptive defense against sophisticated cyber threats through collaborative agent coordination

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to cybersecurity, particularly for automated cyber defense systems. The paper identifies key limitations of single-agent approaches in complex network environments and demonstrates how MARL enables more effective defense through decentralized coordination and adaptive learning. Through analysis of game-theoretic frameworks, MARL algorithms, and training environments, the authors establish MARL as a promising paradigm for addressing modern cybersecurity challenges. The work bridges theoretical foundations with practical implementation considerations, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of MARL in real-world deployment scenarios.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing research on MARL applications in cybersecurity through systematic literature review and theoretical analysis. It examines game-theoretic models of attacker-defender interactions, surveys MARL algorithms including CTDE frameworks and value decomposition methods, and evaluates training environments like Cyber Gyms for developing Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents (AICA). The methodological approach involves mapping theoretical concepts to practical cybersecurity applications, analyzing scalability challenges, and identifying gaps between simulation training and real-world deployment. The survey provides a framework for understanding how MARL can address specific cybersecurity challenges through collaborative multi-agent defense strategies.

## Key Results
- MARL enables decentralized defense strategies that adapt to dynamic threat environments without centralized coordination
- CTDE frameworks allow scalable multi-agent coordination by decoupling learning complexity from execution constraints
- Game-theoretic modeling of attacker-defender interactions produces robust defensive policies through equilibrium-seeking behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) enables scalable multi-agent coordination by decoupling learning complexity from execution constraints.
- Mechanism: During training, each agent learns a centralized Q-function that conditions on global state and joint actions, allowing coordination signals to propagate. During execution, agents rely only on local observations and their learned policies, eliminating runtime communication overhead.
- Core assumption: The training environment accurately reflects the state dynamics and reward structure of deployment; agents can transfer centralized knowledge to decentralized decision-making.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MARL enables decentralized, adaptive, and collaborative defense strategies"
  - [Section III-C, Table I] "Centralized critic enables inter-agent coordination during training... Decentralized execution for scalability"
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; neighboring paper "Guidelines for Applying RL and MARL" mentions CTDE but no empirical benchmarks cited
- Break condition: If execution environments have state distributions that diverge significantly from training (reality gap), decentralized policies may fail to coordinate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Modeling attacker-defender interactions as zero-sum stochastic games produces robust defensive policies through equilibrium-seeking behavior.
- Mechanism: The attacker maximizes expected reward E(x,y) while the defender minimizes it. MARL algorithms approximate Nash equilibria where neither party unilaterally improves—driving both agents toward increasingly sophisticated strategies through self-play.
- Core assumption: Attackers and defenders have perfectly opposing objectives (zero-sum); real-world threats may have mixed or unknown utility functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section III-B-1a] "In a zero-sum attacker-defender game... The game's solution is a Nash equilibrium"
  - [Section V-B] "T. Kunz et al. demonstrated that adversarial training of an attacker (red agent) against a defender (blue agent) enhances the defender's ability to counter sophisticated attacks"
  - [corpus] "PoolFlip" paper models FlipIt game for defender-adversary interactions, but empirical validation remains limited
- Break condition: If attacker strategies fall outside the training distribution (e.g., novel APT techniques), equilibrium-derived defenses may not generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Value decomposition transforms intractable joint credit assignment into learnable individual contributions for cooperative defense.
- Mechanism: VDN decomposes a global Q-value Q_tot into additive individual Q_i components. This allows each agent to learn its contribution to collective success without explicit coordination signals, enabling distributed intrusion detection and response.
- Core assumption: The true joint value function is approximately monotonic in individual agent contributions; complex inter-agent dependencies may not decompose additively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section III-B-1a] "The collective reward can be expressed as the sum of individual rewards"
  - [Table I] "VDN... decomposes a joint Q-value received by a single global reward function into additive components"
  - [corpus] No direct empirical validation in neighboring papers; this remains a theoretical framework
- Break condition: If defense tasks require non-additive coordination (e.g., simultaneous multi-point responses), simple decomposition underestimates joint value.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partial Observability
  - Why needed here: All MARL formulations extend from MDPs; cybersecurity environments are inherently partially observable (defenders cannot see attacker actions directly).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a POMDP requires a belief state instead of direct state observation?

- Concept: Game Theory Fundamentals (Nash Equilibrium, Zero-Sum Games)
  - Why needed here: The paper models cybersecurity as stochastic games; understanding equilibrium concepts is essential for interpreting MARL convergence guarantees.
  - Quick check question: In a two-player zero-sum game, what does it mean when both players are at a Nash equilibrium?

- Concept: Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Systems
  - Why needed here: Determining which agent's action contributed to a global reward is the core challenge addressed by VDN, QMIX, and related algorithms.
  - Quick check question: Why is credit assignment harder in MARL than in single-agent RL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Environment Layer: Cyber Gym (CyberBattleSim, NASimEmu, CybORG++) providing state transitions and rewards
  - Agent Layer: N autonomous agents with local observations o_i, policies π_i, and optional communication channels
  - Training Infrastructure: Centralized critics (CTDE), replay buffers, and reward shaping modules
  - Execution Layer: Decentralized policy deployment with AICA reference architecture functions (Sensing, Planning, Execution, Collaboration, Learning)

- Critical path:
  1. Define threat model and observable state space (partial observability constraints)
  2. Select training paradigm (cooperative vs. competitive vs. mixed-interest)
  3. Choose Cyber Gym matching deployment fidelity requirements (simulation vs. emulation)
  4. Configure reward structure aligned with security objectives (detection rate, false positive cost)
  5. Train with self-play or scripted adversaries until policy convergence
  6. Validate in held-out scenarios before deployment consideration

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Simulation speed vs. realism**: Abstract gyms (CyberBattleSim) scale but have reality gaps; emulators (NASimEmu emulation mode) are realistic but resource-intensive
  - **Centralized vs. decentralized execution**: Centralized offers better coordination but single point of failure; decentralized is robust but harder to coordinate
  - **Competitive vs. cooperative training**: Competitive (red vs. blue) yields robust defenses but slower convergence; cooperative trains faster but may miss adversarial adaptation

- Failure signatures:
  - Policies that exploit simulation artifacts rather than learning generalizable strategies
  - Collapsing coordination in decentralized execution when communication is assumed but unavailable
  - Overfitting to specific attacker profiles; fails against novel attack vectors
  - Reward hacking where agents maximize metrics without improving actual security posture

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline single-agent vs. multi-agent comparison**: Train SARL and MARL (MAPPO) on identical CyberBattleSim scenarios; measure detection rate, response time, and scalability as agent count increases.
  2. **Adversarial robustness test**: Train defender with one attacker profile; evaluate against scripted attackers with different exploit patterns not seen during training.
  3. **Sim-to-real gap assessment**: Train policies in CyberBattleSim (simulation), deploy in NASimEmu emulation mode; measure performance degradation and identify failure modes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the reality gap between MARL agents trained in cyber gym simulations and their deployment in real-world network environments be systematically measured and minimized?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper repeatedly identifies the "reality gap" as a persistent barrier, noting that agents trained in environments like CyberBattleSim face "limited real-world applicability" and that this gap limits MARL's current deployment in cybersecurity.
- Why unresolved: Current cyber gyms use abstracted simulations that lack real-world complexities; emulation approaches are resource-intensive and less scalable. No standardized methodology exists for quantifying or systematically closing this gap.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of validated transfer learning techniques or domain adaptation methods showing comparable agent performance metrics between simulated and real network deployments, along with a quantifiable measure of gap reduction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural modifications to MARL algorithms are required to maintain performance and stability when scaling to large-scale, distributed network environments with hundreds or thousands of agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies scalability as an active area of research, noting that "addressing scalability remains an active area of research and often necessitates approximations or abstractions" and that "computational complexity of SARL increases exponentially with larger state and action spaces."
- Why unresolved: Current MARL frameworks (CTDE, VDN, MAPPO) have been demonstrated primarily in smaller-scale scenarios; the paper notes CybORG++ faces "limitations in scalability for complex, large-scale networks."
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark results from MARL algorithms operating successfully in networks with 100+ agents, showing maintained coordination, convergence properties, and computational tractability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can generative models (e.g., GANs) be effectively integrated with MARL agents to automatically generate diverse and realistic attack scenarios for training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly proposes this as future research: "integrating agents with generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could improve scenario diversity and thus enable more effective strategies against complex threats."
- Why unresolved: No implementation framework or evaluation methodology currently exists for this integration in the cybersecurity MARL domain; the paper identifies this only as a proposed direction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated integration architecture showing improved defender agent generalization to novel attack patterns, measured through performance on previously unseen attack scenarios compared to baseline training without generative augmentation.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What formal guarantees or verification methods can ensure that cooperative MARL defense agents will not learn collusive or harmful behaviors under adversarial manipulation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes the importance of "adversarial robustness" as a key challenge and notes that agents optimize policies in environments where "multiple opposing agents dynamically change their strategies." However, it does not address safety or verification of learned cooperative behaviors.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides no discussion of formal verification, safe exploration, or mechanisms to detect/prevent emergent maladaptive behaviors in cooperative defense swarms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal verification frameworks or testing protocols that can certify bounds on agent behavior under adversarial perturbations, demonstrated through adversarial robustness benchmarks.

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation data for most proposed mechanisms and theoretical claims
- Unspecified hyperparameters and reward structures for MARL algorithms in cybersecurity contexts
- Unquantified reality gap between simulation environments and actual network deployment scenarios

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The theoretical foundations of MARL (CTDE, game-theoretic formulations, value decomposition) are well-established in the broader MARL literature and correctly applied to cybersecurity contexts.
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed benefits of MARL over single-agent approaches (scalability, adaptability, collaborative defense) are logically sound but lack direct empirical validation in the cybersecurity domain.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about MARL's effectiveness against sophisticated threats and its ability to reach Nash equilibria in zero-sum cybersecurity games remain largely theoretical without demonstrated real-world performance.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Benchmarking**: Implement the proposed MARL framework (e.g., MAPPO with CTDE) in a standardized Cyber Gym and compare detection rates, response times, and resource utilization against established single-agent baselines across multiple attack scenarios.

2. **Reality Gap Measurement**: Train MARL policies in simulation environments, then deploy them in network emulation environments with realistic traffic patterns and attacker behaviors; quantify performance degradation and identify specific adaptation requirements.

3. **Adversarial Robustness Testing**: Evaluate trained MARL defenders against attack strategies not seen during training, including zero-day exploits and adaptive adversaries that learn to counter the defense policies; measure generalization capabilities and failure modes.
