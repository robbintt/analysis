# RULERS: Locked Rubrics and Evidence-Anchored Scoring for Robust LLM Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08654
- Reference count: 19
- This paper introduces RULERS, a framework for improving LLM-based scoring by addressing three key issues: rubric instability, unverifiable reasoning, and scale misalignment.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RULERS, a framework for improving LLM-based scoring by addressing three key issues: rubric instability, unverifiable reasoning, and scale misalignment. RULERS converts natural language rubrics into locked, executable specifications, enforces evidence-anchored inference, and calibrates scores to match human distributions. Experiments on essay and summarization tasks show RULERS achieves significantly higher human agreement (e.g., QWK scores up to 0.73 on ASAP 2.0) compared to baselines, maintains stability under adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to match larger ones. By grounding scoring in deterministic checklists and verifiable evidence, RULERS produces more consistent, auditable, and calibrated evaluations without model fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
RULERS addresses LLM evaluation reliability through a three-phase pipeline. Phase I compiles natural language rubrics into immutable JSON bundles containing fixed taxonomies, operational checklists with granular binary/ternary decision items, and deterministic evidence rules. Phase II enforces structured decoding requiring the model to output checklist decisions and verbatim quotes anchored to sentence IDs, with a verification function validating exact string matches and an evidence gate mechanically capping scores when insufficient quotes are provided. Phase III applies Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration via quantile matching to align model score distributions with human grading boundaries. The framework operates without model fine-tuning and maintains consistency across inference runs through deterministic execution.

## Key Results
- RULERS achieves QWK scores up to 0.73 on ASAP 2.0, significantly outperforming baselines
- Smaller models (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.1-8B) match larger models (GPT-4o) when using RULERS
- The framework maintains stability under adversarial rubric perturbations
- Ablation shows calibration is most critical for QWK, while evidence anchoring enables auditability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Rubric Compilation into Immutable Specifications
Converting natural language rubrics into locked, executable checklists reduces stochastic interpretation variance across inference runs. A compilation function transforms raw rubric R into a versioned JSON bundle containing fixed taxonomy, operational checklist with granular binary/ternary decision items, and deterministic evidence rules. The bundle is hashed and executed identically for every instance, eliminating runtime reinterpretation. Core assumption: rubric instability primarily stems from prompt sensitivity and positional biases during generation, not from fundamental model incapacity.

### Mechanism 2: Evidence-Anchored Inference with Mechanical Verification
Enforcing extractive quote requirements with deterministic string verification prevents hallucinated justifications and grounds scores in auditable evidence. Schema-constrained decoding requires the model to output structured objects containing checklist decisions and verbatim quotes anchored to sentence IDs. A verification function validates exact string matches. An evidence gate caps scores mechanically if valid evidence count is less than m, making high scores mathematically impossible without verifiable grounding. Core assumption: quality aspects requiring evaluation can be justified via verbatim excerpts; holistic properties may be underrepresented.

### Mechanism 3: Distributional Calibration via Optimal Transport
Post-hoc calibration using Wasserstein-based quantile matching aligns model score distributions with human grading boundaries without parameter updates. A Wasserstein Generative Regression layer learns a non-parametric optimal transport map that transports model score density to match human reference distribution, correcting systematic severity/leniency biases while preserving ranking order. Core assumption: the frozen model possesses reasonable internal ranking capability, but its raw probability distribution is misaligned with human ordinal scales.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Optimal Transport / Wasserstein Distance**
  - Why needed here: Phase III uses Wasserstein distance to align score distributions. Understanding quantile matching and CDF inversion helps explain why this preserves ranking while correcting distributional bias.
  - Quick check question: Given two distributions F_model and F_human, what does g(z) = F⁻¹_human(F_model(z)) compute?

- Concept: **Schema-Constrained Decoding**
  - Why needed here: Phase II forces structured JSON output rather than free-form generation. Understanding constrained decoding explains how the framework enforces evidence extraction mechanically.
  - Quick check question: How does schema-constrained decoding differ from post-hoc parsing of free-form output?

- Concept: **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)**
  - Why needed here: Primary evaluation metric. QWK measures inter-rater agreement while correcting for chance, and is sensitive to ordinal scale alignment.
  - Quick check question: Why is QWK preferred over simple correlation for ordinal scoring tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw rubric R -> Compilation function π -> Locked bundle B (JSON: taxonomy T, checklist C, evidence rules) -> Input x + Bundle B -> Frozen LLM f_θ -> Structured output (decisions d, quotes E_k) -> Verification V(q,u) -> Evidence gate -> Raw scores s -> WGR calibration -> Final calibrated scores

- Critical path: Rubric compilation quality → Evidence extraction fidelity → Calibration data quality. The ablation shows Phase III is most critical for QWK, but Phase II determines auditability.

- Design tradeoffs: Extractive evidence enables verification but may miss holistic properties. Post-hoc calibration improves agreement but requires labeled data and may not transfer. Locked rubrics ensure stability but cannot self-correct for underspecified criteria.

- Failure signatures: Scores clustering at boundaries → Evidence gate triggering too aggressively (check string matching). Distribution mismatch persists → Calibration data insufficient or distributionally shifted. High variance across runs → Locking phase not applied correctly; model reinterpreting rubric.

- First 3 experiments: 1) Apply Phase I to a simple rubric, verify bundle hash is deterministic across multiple invocations. 2) Run Phase II on inputs with known properties; confirm high scores are capped when evidence count < m. 3) Compare raw scores vs. WGR-calibrated scores on a held-out set; quantify QWK improvement to verify Phase III contribution.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can RULERS effectively evaluate holistic qualities (e.g., cross-document coherence, global argumentation) that resist decomposition into verbatim extractive evidence?
2. How robustly does the learned WGR calibration mapping transfer across domains, rubrics, or score scales without recalibration?
3. Can more flexible evidence verification mechanisms (e.g., fuzzy matching, semantic similarity) improve scoring sensitivity without compromising auditability?

## Limitations
- Strict string matching for evidence verification may be brittle to formatting differences, tokenization artifacts, or minor normalization issues, potentially rejecting valid evidence and triggering overly conservative score capping.
- The evidence-anchoring approach may underrepresent holistic evaluation aspects like long-span coherence that cannot be justified by verbatim excerpts.
- WGR calibration requires labeled development data and may not generalize across different rubrics or score distributions without recalibration.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The mechanism of locking rubrics into immutable specifications demonstrably reduces prompt sensitivity and improves stability across runs.
- **Medium Confidence:** Evidence-anchored inference with mechanical verification improves auditability, though the strict string matching may be too brittle for real-world deployment.
- **Medium Confidence:** Distributional calibration via Wasserstein-based quantile matching improves agreement scores, but the method requires labeled data and may not transfer across rubrics.

## Next Checks
1. Test evidence verification with adversarial formatting variations (spacing, punctuation, tokenization) to quantify brittleness of string matching.
2. Evaluate calibration stability by testing WGR on out-of-distribution rubric distributions or with reduced calibration sample sizes.
3. Assess holistic evaluation capability by comparing RULERS scores against human ratings on coherence and argument flow dimensions that require long-span reasoning.
