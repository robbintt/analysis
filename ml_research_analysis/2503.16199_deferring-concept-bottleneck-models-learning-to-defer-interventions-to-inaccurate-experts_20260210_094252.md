# Deferring Concept Bottleneck Models: Learning to Defer Interventions to Inaccurate Experts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.16199
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16199
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: DCBMs improve task accuracy in concept-incomplete scenarios by intelligently deferring to human experts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Deferring Concept Bottleneck Models (DCBMs), which extend traditional Concept Bottleneck Models by adding the ability to learn when to defer concept or task predictions to human experts. The framework treats each concept and task prediction as a deferring system that decides between making a prediction or deferring to human intervention. DCBMs are trained using a consistent surrogate loss derived from the negative log-likelihood of the model's probabilistic formulation. The approach significantly improves task accuracy, particularly in concept-incomplete scenarios, while providing interpretable explanations for deferral decisions.

## Method Summary
DCBMs build upon traditional Concept Bottleneck Models by incorporating a deferring mechanism at both the concept and task prediction levels. The model learns to decide whether to make a prediction or defer to a human expert based on uncertainty estimates. The training process uses a surrogate loss that is consistent with the negative log-likelihood of the model's probabilistic formulation. This allows the model to optimize both prediction accuracy and deferral decisions simultaneously. The framework handles concept-incomplete scenarios by completing missing concepts through either model predictions or expert interventions, then using these completed concepts for task prediction.

## Key Results
- DCBMs significantly improve task accuracy compared to standard CBMs, especially in concept-incomplete scenarios
- The deferring mechanism enables the model to intelligently choose when human intervention is beneficial
- DCBMs provide interpretable explanations by highlighting which concepts require human intervention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DCBMs work by combining the interpretability of concept bottleneck models with the flexibility of deferral mechanisms. The key insight is that instead of forcing predictions on uncertain or incomplete concepts, the model learns to recognize when human expertise would be more reliable. This is achieved through a probabilistic formulation where each prediction decision is weighted by its expected utility, including the cost of deferral versus the risk of incorrect prediction.

## Foundational Learning

**Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)**: Models that first predict interpretable concepts before making task predictions. Why needed: Provides interpretable intermediate representations. Quick check: Understand how concepts relate to final task predictions.

**Deferral Mechanisms**: Systems that decide when to delegate decisions to human experts. Why needed: Enables hybrid human-AI decision making. Quick check: Understand trade-offs between prediction confidence and deferral costs.

**Surrogate Loss Functions**: Approximate loss functions used when true loss is intractable. Why needed: Enables training of complex probabilistic models. Quick check: Verify consistency between surrogate and true objectives.

**Concept Incompleteness**: Scenarios where ground truth concepts are partially or fully missing. Why needed: Real-world scenarios rarely have complete supervision. Quick check: Understand strategies for handling missing concept labels.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Features -> Concept Predictor -> Deferral Gate -> (Prediction/Expert Intervention) -> Task Predictor -> Output

Critical Path: The deferral gates are the critical components, as they determine whether predictions flow through the concept predictors or route to expert intervention. The concept completion strategy (whether using model predictions or expert interventions) directly impacts downstream task performance.

Design Tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff is between deferral rate and accuracy - higher deferral rates typically lead to better accuracy but reduce automation. The surrogate loss formulation trades computational tractability for theoretical consistency with the true objective.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include over-deferral (deferring when model predictions would suffice) and under-deferral (making predictions when expert input is needed). These can be identified through analysis of deferral patterns on validation data.

First Experiments:
1. Compare DCBM performance against standard CBM on concept-complete datasets
2. Evaluate deferral rate vs accuracy tradeoff curves across different datasets
3. Test concept completion strategies (model vs expert) on concept-incomplete data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on assumptions about human expert behavior that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Performance improvements need validation on larger-scale and more diverse datasets
- Analysis of deferral decisions could be more comprehensive in exploring failure modes

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical formulation and surrogate loss derivation
- Medium confidence in empirical results due to relatively small scale of experiments
- Medium confidence in interpretability claims due to limited analysis of deferral decision patterns

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DCBMs on larger-scale datasets and real-world scenarios to assess performance in complex and noisy environments
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of deferring mechanism, surrogate loss, and concept completion strategy
3. Implement and test alternative human expert models to evaluate robustness to variations in expert behavior
