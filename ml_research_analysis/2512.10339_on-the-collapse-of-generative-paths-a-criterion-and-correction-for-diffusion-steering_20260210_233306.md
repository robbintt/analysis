core_contribution: This paper identifies Marginal Path Collapse, a failure mode in
  ratio-of-densities diffusion steering where intermediate densities become non-normalizable
  despite valid endpoints, especially when composing heterogeneous models with different
  noise schedules. The authors provide a rigorous path existence criterion that predicts
  when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone.

# On the Collapse of Generative Paths: A Criterion and Correction for Diffusion Steering

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: Introduces Marginal Path Collapse identification and ACE correction for diffusion steering, achieving >5x error reduction on synthetic benchmarks and superior molecular design performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical failure mode in diffusion-based generative model steering called Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable during ratio-of-densities path composition, even when endpoint distributions are valid. The authors identify that this collapse occurs specifically when composing heterogeneous models with different noise schedules, a common scenario in multi-expert generative systems. They establish a theoretical path existence criterion that predicts collapse from noise schedules and exponents, then introduce ACE (Adaptive path Correction with Exponents), which dynamically adjusts time-varying exponents to satisfy the criterion. The approach demonstrates substantial improvements in both synthetic benchmarks and practical molecular design tasks, particularly in flexible-pose scaffold decoration where it achieves mean docking scores of -5.72 kcal/mol at guidance scale 1.3 with 100% validity.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework for analyzing Marginal Path Collapse in diffusion steering, establishing conditions under which intermediate distributions become non-normalizable during path composition. They introduce the path existence criterion that predicts collapse based on noise schedules and guidance exponents. The ACE algorithm extends Feynman-Kac steering by incorporating time-varying exponents that adaptively adjust during the generation process. ACE dynamically modifies the guidance weights to ensure the path existence criterion is satisfied throughout the generation trajectory. The method operates in continuous-time diffusion settings but is implemented in discrete-time for practical applications.

## Key Results
- ACE reduces distributional error by over 5x compared to baselines on a synthetic 2D checkerboard benchmark
- In flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and achieves mean docking scores of -5.72 kcal/mol at guidance scale 1.3 with 100% validity
- ACE outperforms specialized task-specific models and baselines that fail at high guidance scales in molecular design tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper identifies that Marginal Path Collapse occurs when composing heterogeneous diffusion models with different noise schedules during ratio-of-densities steering. The key insight is that even when endpoint distributions are valid, the intermediate distributions along the path can become non-normalizable due to incompatible noise schedules and guidance exponents. ACE works by dynamically adjusting the exponents during generation to maintain normalizability throughout the path, effectively ensuring the path existence criterion is satisfied at every step.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Marginal Path Collapse** - A failure mode where intermediate densities become non-normalizable during diffusion steering path composition. Needed to understand the core problem being solved and why standard ratio-of-densities approaches fail in heterogeneous model composition.

2. **Path Existence Criterion** - A theoretical condition that predicts whether Marginal Path Collapse will occur based on noise schedules and guidance exponents. Essential for determining when collapse is likely and for designing correction mechanisms.

3. **Feynman-Kac Steering** - A framework for controlling diffusion processes by incorporating potential functions. The foundation that ACE extends by adding time-varying exponents to maintain path validity.

4. **Heterogeneous Model Composition** - The practice of combining different diffusion models with varying noise schedules for multi-expert generative systems. Important context for why the collapse problem is particularly relevant in practical applications.

5. **Guidance Scale** - The parameter controlling the strength of conditioning signals in diffusion models. Critical for understanding how ACE maintains effectiveness even at high guidance scales where other methods fail.

6. **Normalizable Distributions** - Probability distributions that integrate to one. Fundamental concept for understanding when distributions are mathematically valid versus when they suffer from the collapse problem.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Noise Schedules -> Path Existence Criterion -> ACE Algorithm -> Guided Generation

Critical Path: The generation process flows through ACE's dynamic exponent adjustment, which continuously checks and satisfies the path existence criterion based on the current noise schedule and guidance scale.

Design Tradeoffs: The paper balances theoretical rigor (continuous-time analysis) with practical implementation (discrete-time execution), accepting discretization errors for computational feasibility. ACE trades computational overhead for guaranteed path validity.

Failure Signatures: Collapse manifests as non-normalizable intermediate distributions, typically occurring at high guidance scales or when composing models with very different noise schedules. Early warning signs include sudden drops in generation quality or numerical instability.

First Experiments:
1. Synthetic 2D checkerboard benchmark to verify ACE's ability to maintain distributional fidelity under controlled conditions
2. High guidance scale test to confirm ACE prevents collapse where baseline methods fail
3. Multi-expert composition test to validate ACE's effectiveness with heterogeneous noise schedules

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework is derived in continuous-time settings, but practical implementations use discrete-time, creating potential gaps in rigor
- The synthetic checkerboard benchmark may not fully capture the complexity of real-world molecular design landscapes
- Molecular scaffold decoration experiments focus on a single scaffold type and reward function, limiting generalizability

## Confidence

- High confidence: The identification of Marginal Path Collapse and basic mechanism of heterogeneous noise schedules causing failure
- Medium confidence: ACE's effectiveness in preventing collapse and improving molecular design outcomes
- Medium confidence: The practical utility of the theoretical path existence criterion

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments on additional molecular scaffolds and reward functions to test the generalizability of ACE's performance gains in scaffold decoration tasks

2. Perform systematic studies quantifying the impact of discretization on the path existence criterion and ACE's correction efficacy, including comparisons between continuous and discrete implementations

3. Apply ACE to other generative composition tasks beyond molecular design, such as image or audio synthesis, to evaluate its broader applicability in preventing marginal path collapse
