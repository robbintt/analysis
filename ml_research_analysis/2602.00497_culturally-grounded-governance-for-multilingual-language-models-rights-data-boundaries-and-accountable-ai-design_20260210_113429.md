# Culturally-Grounded Governance for Multilingual Language Models: Rights, Data Boundaries, and Accountable AI Design

## Quick Facts

- Multilingual AI governance requires rights-based frameworks to address cultural erasure and power asymmetries.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies three core governance challenges for multilingual large language models (MLLMs): inequities in training data and evaluation practices, misalignment between global deployment and local norms, and limited accountability mechanisms for marginalized language communities. It proposes a culturally grounded governance framework that reframes multilingual AI governance as a sociocultural and rights-based problem, emphasizing the need for data stewardship, transparency, and participatory accountability. Rather than technical benchmarks, the authors outline design and policy implications to ensure MLLMs do not reproduce global inequalities under the guise of scale and neutrality. The framework prioritizes protecting linguistic diversity and cultural integrity in AI development.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review and conceptual framework synthesis for Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Using ACM Digital Library and Google Scholar, the authors search for papers addressing MLLMs in collaborative contexts, filtering for the past 5–10 years. They categorize 40 references into four attributes: Data Quality, Dependability & Operability, Human-Centered Design, and Human Oversight. The methodology focuses on identifying governance gaps and proposing a rights-based framework for culturally grounded AI development.

## Key Results
- Reframes multilingual AI governance as a rights-based problem to surface structural inequities
- Proposes a four-attribute trustworthiness framework (Data Quality → Dependability → Human-Centered Design → Human Oversight)
- Identifies participatory accountability mechanisms as essential for aligning global deployment with local norms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reframing multilingual AI governance as a rights-based problem may surface structural inequities that technical benchmarks alone cannot detect.
- Mechanism: The paper's framework shifts evaluation from performance metrics (e.g., BLEU scores) to sociocultural attributes—Data Quality, Dependability, Human-Centered Design, and Human Oversight. This lens exposes how training data asymmetries and tokenization inadequacies produce discriminatory outcomes for low-resource language speakers.
- Core assumption: Governance gaps are primarily diagnostic failures (wrong framing) rather than tooling failures (lack of metrics).
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "reframes multilingual AI governance as a sociocultural and rights based problem"; [section 3.1]: "inadequate tokenization and biased training data often result in misinterpretations and oversimplifications of languages that are underrepresented"; [corpus]: "Advancing Data Equity" (arXiv:2508.
