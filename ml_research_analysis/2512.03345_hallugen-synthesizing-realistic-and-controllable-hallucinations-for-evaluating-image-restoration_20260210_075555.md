- Introduces diffusion-based framework for controllable hallucination generation in image restoration

## Executive Summary
HalluGen addresses a critical gap in image restoration evaluation by introducing a diffusion-based framework for synthesizing realistic and controllable hallucinations. Traditional restoration models often produce hallucinations—outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect—which pose significant risks in safety-critical domains like medical imaging. HalluGen extends diffusion posterior sampling with targeted gradient perturbations to generate both intrinsic (measurement-inconsistent) and extrinsic (measurement-consistent but semantically incorrect) hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity. The method produces perceptually realistic outputs that significantly degrade segmentation accuracy, enabling systematic evaluation of restoration failures that was previously impossible.

## Method Summary
HalluGen leverages diffusion models for image restoration, which traditionally aim to remove noise from measurements to recover clean images. The framework extends standard diffusion posterior sampling by introducing controlled gradient perturbations that guide the denoising process toward generating specific types of hallucinations. For intrinsic hallucinations, perturbations are designed to create inconsistencies with the measurement data, while extrinsic hallucinations are generated by perturbing the semantic content while maintaining measurement consistency. The framework operates by modifying the gradient descent step during diffusion sampling, where perturbations are applied to steer the denoising process toward desired hallucination characteristics. This approach enables precise control over hallucination type, spatial location, and severity while maintaining perceptual realism in the generated outputs.

## Key Results
- HalluGen generates intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity
- Hallucinations significantly degrade segmentation performance (IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36)
- SHAFE metric improves hallucination detection (AUC increases by 0.25, false negatives reduced by 24 percentage points)
- Created first large-scale hallucination dataset (4,350 annotated images from 1,450 brain MR scans)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HalluGen works by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and their ability to generate diverse outputs through controlled sampling. The framework introduces targeted perturbations during the denoising process that systematically bias the generation toward specific hallucination types. By modifying the gradient descent steps, HalluGen can steer the diffusion process to either deviate from measurement consistency (intrinsic hallucinations) or maintain consistency while altering semantic content (extrinsic hallucinations). This controllability is achieved through careful design of perturbation functions that are applied at each denoising step, allowing researchers to specify desired hallucination characteristics such as location, type, and severity. The approach leverages the inherent flexibility of diffusion models while adding precise control mechanisms for hallucination generation.

## Foundational Learning

**Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to denoise data through iterative refinement. Why needed: Forms the foundation for controllable hallucination generation. Quick check: Understand the forward (noise addition) and reverse (denoising) processes.

**Measurement Models**: Mathematical representations of how measurements relate to underlying signals. Why needed: Critical for distinguishing intrinsic vs extrinsic hallucinations. Quick check: Verify understanding of how measurements constrain restoration outputs.

**Gradient Perturbations**: Controlled modifications to optimization gradients during sampling. Why needed: Enables steering diffusion processes toward specific hallucination types. Quick check: Ensure grasp of how perturbations affect sampling trajectories.

**Posterior Sampling**: The process of generating samples from a conditional distribution. Why needed: Forms the basis for controlled hallucination generation. Quick check: Understand how conditioning on measurements affects output generation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Measurement Model -> Diffusion Model -> Perturbation Module -> Hallucination Generator -> SHAFE Metric

**Critical Path**: The perturbation module is the core innovation, modifying diffusion gradients to control hallucination characteristics while maintaining perceptual quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Controllability vs. perceptual realism: More aggressive perturbations increase control but may reduce realism
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic focus: Different perturbation strategies required for each hallucination type
- Computational cost: Additional perturbations increase sampling time

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Excessive perturbation magnitude leads to unrealistic artifacts
- Incorrect measurement model specification causes generation of physically implausible hallucinations
- Insufficient perturbation strength results in outputs that don't adequately represent restoration failures

**First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study varying perturbation magnitude to identify optimal balance between control and realism
2. Cross-dataset evaluation of SHAFE metric on different restoration tasks
3. User study with radiologists to validate clinical relevance of generated hallucinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on accurate measurement models and forward operators for quality hallucination generation
- Perceptual realism may not fully capture diversity of real-world restoration failures
- Generalization of hallucination detectors to clinical settings requires further validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Claims about systematic evaluation capability and SHAFE metric improvements are well-supported by experimental results.

**Medium Confidence**: Generalization of hallucination detectors to real-world scenarios, while promising, needs further clinical validation.

## Next Checks

1. Clinical validation study with radiologists to assess whether HalluGen-generated hallucinations accurately represent real-world restoration failures in medical imaging

2. Ablation study varying diffusion model architectures and training procedures to quantify their impact on hallucination realism and controllability

3. Extended evaluation of SHAFE on additional image restoration tasks (e.g., super-resolution, denoising) to verify its general applicability beyond MRI enhancement scenarios
