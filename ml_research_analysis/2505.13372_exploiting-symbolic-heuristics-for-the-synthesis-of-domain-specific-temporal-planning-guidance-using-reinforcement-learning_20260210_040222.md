# Exploiting Symbolic Heuristics for the Synthesis of Domain-Specific Temporal Planning Guidance using Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.13372
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13372
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** Reinforcement learning framework using symbolic heuristics improves temporal planning guidance synthesis

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a reinforcement learning framework for synthesizing domain-specific temporal planning guidance by leveraging symbolic heuristics throughout the learning and planning pipeline. The key innovation lies in using symbolic heuristics for reward shaping, learning residuals rather than complete value functions, and integrating learned guidance with systematic search through a multi-queue approach. The framework addresses the challenge of improving temporal planner performance by learning from distributions of training problems.

The authors evaluate their approach across three benchmark temporal planning domains, demonstrating that all proposed techniques significantly outperform baseline planners without learned information. Notably, the residual learning approach accelerates convergence, while the multi-queue method consistently improves performance by balancing greedy exploitation with systematic exploration. This work advances the state of the art in automated temporal planning guidance synthesis.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework employs reinforcement learning to synthesize temporal planning guidance by integrating symbolic heuristics throughout the pipeline. The approach uses symbolic heuristics for reward shaping, enabling the learning algorithm to focus on relevant aspects of the state space. Rather than learning complete value functions, the framework learns residuals that capture the differences between heuristic estimates and actual values. A multi-queue approach combines learned guidance with systematic search, maintaining separate queues for greedy exploitation and systematic exploration. The framework is trained on distributions of problems from specific domains, allowing it to learn domain-specific patterns and heuristics.

## Key Results
- All proposed techniques (reward shaping, residual learning, multi-queue approach) significantly outperform baseline planners without learned information
- Learning residuals accelerates convergence compared to learning full value functions
- The multi-queue approach consistently improves performance across domains by balancing greedy exploitation with systematic exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by leveraging symbolic heuristics as a bridge between classical planning knowledge and learned guidance. Symbolic heuristics provide domain-specific structural information that guides the learning process, making it more sample-efficient and focused. By learning residuals instead of complete value functions, the approach builds upon existing heuristic knowledge rather than replacing it entirely. The multi-queue approach ensures that learned guidance doesn't completely replace systematic search, maintaining completeness while improving efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal planning concepts**: Understanding state spaces, actions, and goal conditions over time is essential for grasping the problem domain
- **Reinforcement learning fundamentals**: Knowledge of value functions, policies, and learning algorithms is necessary to understand the synthesis approach
- **Symbolic heuristics in planning**: Familiarity with how heuristics guide search in classical planning helps explain the integration strategy
- **Reward shaping techniques**: Understanding how to modify reward functions to guide learning is crucial for the framework's design
- **Multi-queue search algorithms**: Knowledge of how maintaining multiple search queues can balance exploration and exploitation is important for the integration approach
- **Residual learning concepts**: Understanding how learning differences from baseline predictions can improve convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Symbolic Heuristics -> Reward Shaping -> Residual Learning -> Multi-queue Integration -> Planning Guidance

**Critical path:** Problem distribution -> Symbolic heuristic extraction -> Reward shaping -> Residual value function learning -> Multi-queue search integration -> Improved planning performance

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework balances between leveraging existing heuristic knowledge and learning new patterns, between greedy exploitation and systematic exploration, and between computational overhead and planning efficiency.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance may indicate inadequate symbolic heuristics, insufficient training problem diversity, or ineffective balance between learned guidance and systematic search.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Test the impact of removing symbolic heuristics from the reward shaping component
2. Compare learning full value functions versus residuals on a simple domain
3. Evaluate the multi-queue approach against pure greedy and pure systematic search baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three benchmark domains, which may not capture full diversity of temporal planning challenges
- Scalability to more complex, real-world problems remains unclear
- Performance when symbolic heuristics are weak or unavailable is not fully characterized

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Core framework effectiveness and benefits of symbolic heuristics for reward shaping

**Medium confidence:** Residual learning acceleration benefits and multi-queue approach advantages

**Medium confidence:** Generalizability to unseen problem distributions

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate performance on larger, more complex temporal planning domains with varying levels of symbolic heuristic quality

2. Conduct systematic analysis of computational overhead across different integration methods (baseline vs. multi-queue)

3. Test robustness to noise in symbolic heuristics and performance when heuristics are partially incorrect
