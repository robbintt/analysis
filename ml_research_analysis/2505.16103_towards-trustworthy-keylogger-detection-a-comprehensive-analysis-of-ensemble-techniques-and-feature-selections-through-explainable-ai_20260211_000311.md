# Towards Trustworthy Keylogger detection: A Comprehensive Analysis of Ensemble Techniques and Feature Selections through Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16103
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16103
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: AdaBoost with Fisher Score feature selection achieved 99.76% accuracy, 0.99 F1 score, and 100% precision on keylogger detection

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for keylogger detection that combines ensemble techniques with explainable AI to enhance model trustworthiness. The research evaluates 10 traditional machine learning models and three ensemble methods on a large dataset of 39,000 samples with 86 features, achieving state-of-the-art performance through strategic feature selection and model combination. The work addresses the critical challenge of balancing detection accuracy with interpretability in security applications, demonstrating that high-performance keylogger detection can be achieved while maintaining transparency in model decision-making.

## Method Summary
The research employs a systematic approach combining multiple machine learning models with ensemble techniques for keylogger detection. The methodology involves feature selection using Information Gain, Lasso L1, and Fisher Score to reduce dimensionality by up to 45%, followed by training and evaluation of 10 traditional models (including Random Forest, SVM, and AdaBoost) and three ensemble methods. The study utilizes explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) to interpret feature contributions and enhance model trustworthiness. Performance is evaluated using standard metrics including accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, specificity, and AUC on a 39,000-sample dataset from Kaggle.

## Key Results
- AdaBoost with Fisher Score feature selection achieved 99.76% accuracy and 0.99 F1 score
- Feature selection reduced dimensionality by up to 45% while maintaining performance
- Ensemble methods outperformed individual traditional models across all evaluation metrics
- Explainable AI techniques successfully identified key feature contributions for detection decisions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The high performance stems from the combination of robust ensemble methods with effective feature selection. Ensemble techniques like AdaBoost leverage multiple weak learners to create stronger predictive models, while feature selection methods identify the most discriminative features for keylogger detection. The integration of explainable AI provides transparency into the model's decision-making process, enabling security practitioners to understand and trust the detection outcomes. This combination addresses both the technical challenge of accurate detection and the practical requirement for interpretability in security contexts.

## Foundational Learning
**Machine Learning Pipeline**: Understanding the sequential process of data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation - needed to grasp how each component contributes to final performance, quick check: verify data flow from raw input to final predictions.

**Ensemble Methods**: Knowledge of how combining multiple models improves prediction accuracy through techniques like bagging and boosting - needed to understand why ensemble approaches outperform individual models, quick check: compare performance metrics between single models and ensemble variants.

**Feature Selection Techniques**: Familiarity with Information Gain, Lasso L1, and Fisher Score methods for dimensionality reduction - needed to comprehend how feature selection impacts model performance and interpretability, quick check: analyze feature importance scores across different selection methods.

**Explainable AI Methods**: Understanding SHAP and LIME for interpreting model decisions - needed to appreciate how transparency enhances trust in security applications, quick check: validate feature importance consistency across multiple explainability techniques.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Knowledge of accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, specificity, and AUC - needed to assess model performance comprehensively, quick check: ensure metric selection aligns with security detection requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Feature Selection (IG/Lasso/Fisher) -> Model Training (10 models + 3 ensembles) -> Evaluation (metrics) -> Explainability (SHAP/LIME)

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is Feature Selection -> Ensemble Model Training -> Evaluation, as these components directly determine detection performance and model selection.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes detection accuracy over computational efficiency, using multiple feature selection methods and ensemble combinations. This increases computational overhead but maximizes detection performance and provides robustness through methodological diversity.

**Failure Signatures**: Model performance degradation would likely manifest through decreased precision and recall metrics, particularly if feature selection fails to identify key discriminative features or if ensemble methods overfit to training data.

**First Experiments**: 1) Replicate feature selection impact analysis using alternative selection methods, 2) Test ensemble model combinations on independent keylogger datasets, 3) Evaluate explainability method consistency across different security threat types.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Dataset generalization concerns due to single-source Kaggle data
- Binary classification may oversimplify real-world malware complexity
- Limited exploration of alternative feature selection methods beyond three tested approaches

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Experimental methodology and statistical results are well-documented with clear performance metrics and reproducible results for the tested dataset.

**Medium Confidence**: Generalizability of findings to real-world deployments given single dataset source and controlled experimental conditions.

**Low Confidence**: Long-term reliability of explainability methods in dynamic security environments and their practical utility for security practitioners.

## Next Checks
1. Test the model pipeline on multiple independent keylogger datasets to assess cross-dataset performance and generalizability
2. Conduct temporal validation by evaluating model performance on data collected at different time periods to assess concept drift handling
3. Perform feature importance stability analysis across different dataset subsets to validate robustness of explainability findings
