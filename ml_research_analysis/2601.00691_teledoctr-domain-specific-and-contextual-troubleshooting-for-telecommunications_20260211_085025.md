# TeleDoCTR: Domain-Specific and Contextual Troubleshooting for Telecommunications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00691
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00691
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TeleDoCTR achieves 80.31% ticket routing accuracy and ROUGE-L scores up to 0.309 in fault analysis generation

## Executive Summary
TeleDoCTR is a domain-specific troubleshooting system for telecommunications that integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning with QLoRA, multi-response generation, and domain-specific rankers to automate ticket routing, retrieval, and fault analysis generation. The system leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with enhanced semantic relevance evaluation to provide contextual troubleshooting solutions. Evaluated on a real-world telecom dataset, TeleDoCTR demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose large language models in both ticket routing accuracy and fault analysis generation quality.

## Method Summary
TeleDoCTR employs a comprehensive approach to telecom troubleshooting by combining domain-specific ranking with generative models. The system uses QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning of language models on telecom-specific data, implements multi-response generation to capture diverse troubleshooting perspectives, and incorporates domain-specific rankers to evaluate semantic relevance of retrieved demonstrations. The architecture integrates these components within a RAG framework to enhance contextual understanding and provide accurate fault analysis generation for telecom service tickets.

## Key Results
- Ticket routing accuracy reaches 80.31% on real-world telecom dataset
- Outperforms general-purpose LLMs in fault analysis generation with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.309
- Significantly improves retrieval recall with Recall@1 reaching 0.251 compared to 0.072 for BM25

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its domain-specific adaptation through QLoRA fine-tuning, which allows efficient incorporation of telecom knowledge while maintaining computational efficiency. The multi-response generation captures diverse troubleshooting approaches, while domain-specific rankers ensure semantic relevance in retrieved demonstrations. The integration of these components within a RAG framework provides contextual understanding that general-purpose LLMs lack in specialized domains like telecommunications.

## Foundational Learning
- **QLoRA fine-tuning**: Parameter-efficient adaptation of large language models to domain-specific data; needed for incorporating telecom knowledge without full fine-tuning overhead; quick check: compare performance with full fine-tuning on subset of data
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Framework that combines information retrieval with generative models; needed to provide contextual grounding for fault analysis; quick check: measure performance degradation without RAG components
- **Domain-specific ranking**: Evaluation of semantic relevance using telecom-specific criteria; needed to improve quality of retrieved demonstrations; quick check: compare against generic semantic similarity measures
- **Multi-response generation**: Producing multiple troubleshooting approaches for single query; needed to capture diverse problem-solving strategies; quick check: measure coverage of different fault categories
- **Semantic relevance evaluation**: Assessment of retrieved content's applicability to telecom troubleshooting; needed to ensure quality of RAG demonstrations; quick check: human evaluation of retrieved content relevance

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input ticket -> Domain-specific ranker -> QLoRA fine-tuned model -> Multi-response generation -> RAG retriever -> Fault analysis output
- **Critical path**: Ticket routing occurs first, followed by retrieval of relevant demonstrations, then fault analysis generation using RAG with fine-tuned model
- **Design tradeoffs**: QLoRA vs full fine-tuning balances efficiency with potential performance loss; multi-response generation increases computational cost but improves coverage; domain-specific rankers require labeled data but improve retrieval quality
- **Failure signatures**: Poor ticket routing accuracy indicates insufficient domain adaptation; low recall suggests inadequate retrieval mechanisms; weak ROUGE-L scores point to poor generative quality
- **First experiments**: 1) Test ticket routing accuracy with held-out data, 2) Measure retrieval recall@1 for different query types, 3) Compare fault analysis quality against baseline LLM without domain adaptation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on proprietary dataset, preventing independent verification
- Performance measured primarily through automated metrics rather than human evaluation of fault analysis quality
- System's effectiveness on rare or novel fault types is not explicitly evaluated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical implementation details and architecture integration are well-documented
- **Medium Confidence**: Reported performance metrics on proprietary dataset are likely accurate but cannot be verified
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about practical superiority require external validation through independent testing

## Next Checks
1. Replicate evaluation using open telecom dataset or release subset of proprietary data for independent verification
2. Conduct human evaluation studies with telecom experts to assess practical utility of generated fault analyses
3. Test system performance on rare fault types and compare robustness against alternative fine-tuning approaches
