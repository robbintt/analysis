# Intelligent Human-Machine Partnership for Manufacturing: Enhancing Warehouse Planning through Simulation-Driven Knowledge Graphs and LLM Collaboration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.18265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18265
- Authors: Himabindu Thogaru; Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan; Zishan Ahmad; Anirudh Deodhar
- Reference count: 18
- One-line primary result: Knowledge Graph and LLM-based framework for warehouse planning achieves 0.92 Pass@1 and 1.00 Pass@2 accuracy for operational queries, with human-validated investigative analysis.

## Executive Summary
This work presents a Knowledge Graph and LLM-based framework for human-AI collaboration in manufacturing warehouse planning. The framework transforms Discrete Event Simulation output into semantically rich Knowledge Graphs, enabling natural language interaction through LLM agents. A dual-path query processing system handles both operational queries (high-accuracy information retrieval) and investigative scenarios (systematic bottleneck diagnosis). For operational questions, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy with average Pass@1 scores of 0.92 and Pass@2 scores of 1.00 across all resource types. For investigative scenarios, the iterative reasoning chain successfully identifies bottleneck root causes, such as extreme worker stage delays causing 39% performance degradation in supplier discharge times. Human evaluation across seven quality dimensions (scores 7.96-9.0/10) validates the framework's effectiveness in supporting complex warehouse diagnostic analysis while maintaining human oversight.

## Method Summary
The framework transforms DES output into a Knowledge Graph capturing resource configurations and package flow relationships, then enables natural language querying through a dual-path LLM agent system. The KG construction pipeline parses simulation logs to create nodes (SUPPLIER, WORKER, AGV, FL, STORAGE) and timestamped relationships representing operational flows. For operational queries, a QA Chain decomposes questions into sub-steps, generates Cypher queries with self-reflection error correction, and synthesizes answers. For investigative queries, a Reasoning Chain iteratively generates context-aware sub-questions, collects evidence through the QA Chain, and assesses sufficiency to identify bottleneck root causes. The system uses Neo4j for graph storage and GPT-5 via LangGraph for LLM processing with temperature 0.0-0.3.

## Key Results
- Operational query accuracy: Pass@1 scores of 0.92 and Pass@2 scores of 1.00 across all resource types
- Investigative scenario performance: Human evaluation scores of 7.96-9.0/10 across seven quality dimensions
- Root cause identification: Successfully traced CamelCargo delays to extreme worker stage wait times causing 39% performance degradation
- System reliability: Self-reflection modules correct 100% of Cypher syntax errors through iterative retry loops

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Graph Grounding for LLM Query Generation
Transforming DES output into a Knowledge Graph with explicit entity-relationship structure enables more reliable LLM-to-database translation than direct SQL-style querying. The KG schema (SUPPLIER, WORKER, AGV, FL, STORAGE nodes with timestamped relationships like SUPPLIER_TO_WORKER, WORKER_TO_AGV) maps warehouse operational flows directly to graph traversal patterns. LLM-generated Cypher queries follow natural relationship chains (e.g., supplier→worker→AGV) rather than requiring complex joins. Core assumption: The ontology design captures operationally meaningful relationships; underspecified schemas would degrade query accuracy.

### Mechanism 2: Query Decomposition with Embedded Self-Reflection
Decomposing complex queries into sequential sub-steps, each with independent Cypher generation and validation, substantially improves Pass@k accuracy versus monolithic single-pass generation. The QA Chain's Step Generation Module creates focused sub-queries; each step executes independently with error-handling loops that provide syntactic correction and semantic validation. Self-reflection at each step catches errors before propagation. Core assumption: Errors are more recoverable at the sub-step level than at the whole-query level; decomposition itself doesn't introduce ambiguity.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Evidence-Driven Reasoning for Diagnostic Investigation
For investigative bottleneck analysis, an iterative reasoning chain that generates context-aware sub-questions based on accumulated KG evidence outperforms fixed analytical pipelines. The Reasoning Module generates sub-questions dynamically; Evidence Collection executes the QA Chain per sub-question; Sufficiency Assessment determines when to synthesize. Each iteration refines the hypothesis based on retrieved data. Core assumption: The LLM can maintain coherent reasoning across iterations; sufficiency criteria correctly balance depth vs. over-analysis.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output structure**
  - Why needed here: Understanding that DES generates event logs with entity IDs, timestamps, and state transitions is prerequisite to designing the KG schema and interpreting query results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain what a "discharge flow" represents in warehouse simulation and what entities participate?

- Concept: **Graph query semantics (Cypher/property graphs)**
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on LLM-generated Cypher queries; understanding MATCH patterns, relationship traversal, and aggregation is necessary to debug query failures.
  - Quick check question: Given nodes (s:SUPPLIER) and (w:WORKER) connected by [stw:SUPPLIER_TO_WORKER], how would you write a Cypher query to find average wait time per supplier?

- Concept: **Iterative reasoning vs. single-pass generation**
  - Why needed here: The dual-path architecture separates operational (single-pass with reflection) from investigative (multi-iteration) processing; understanding when each applies is critical for system design.
  - Quick check question: What characteristics of a user query would indicate it should route to the Reasoning Chain rather than the QA Chain?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User Query → Query Classifier → [Operational Path: QA Chain] or [Investigative Path: Reasoning Chain] → Step Generator or Sub-Question Generator → Cypher Generation → Execution + Self-Reflection → Answer Synthesis or Findings Summarizer

- Critical path: The KG schema design and construction pipeline (Stage 1) is the foundation—if entity relationships are incorrectly modeled, all downstream query accuracy degrades.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Temperature 0.0-0.3**: Prioritizes precision over creative exploration; appropriate for operational queries but may limit investigative hypothesis generation.
  - **Decomposition granularity**: Finer sub-steps improve error isolation but increase LLM call overhead and potential context fragmentation.
  - **Sufficiency threshold**: Early termination speeds response but risks incomplete diagnosis; conservative thresholds ensure thoroughness but increase latency.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low Pass@1 with high Pass@2: Sub-step decomposition working but first-attempt Cypher generation needs prompt refinement.
  - Investigative queries returning trivial conclusions: Sufficiency assessment triggering too early; sub-question generator not exploring hypothesis space.
  - Repeated self-reflection loops: Query templates mismatched to KG schema patterns; may need additional few-shot examples.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate KG construction on sample DES output: Load simulation logs, verify relationship integrity (e.g., all packages have complete SUPPLIER→WORKER→AGV→FL→STORAGE chains), check timestamp consistency.
  2. Benchmark operational query accuracy by entity type: Run the 25 operational questions, categorize failures by resource type (SUPPLIER, WORKER, AGV, FORKLIFT, PACKAGE), identify systematic Cypher generation gaps.
  3. Trace investigative reasoning on known bottleneck: Introduce a controlled delay (e.g., specific forklift degraded), run the Reasoning Chain, verify that sub-question sequence logically converges to the injected root cause.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the framework successfully generalize to warehouse operations beyond unloading, such as picking, packing, and inventory management?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that "Future work must systematically evaluate performance across picking, packing, inventory management and other operational contexts."
- Why unresolved: The current validation is restricted to warehouse unloading scenarios, and the Knowledge Graph schema design currently requires substantial domain expertise for new configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of similar Pass@k accuracy and diagnostic quality when applied to simulation data from non-unloading warehouse processes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What rigorous methodologies are required to formally quantify the performance of autonomous industrial planning agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that expanding the framework "necessitates developing rigorous benchmarking methodologies to formally quantify performance."
- Why unresolved: Current evaluations rely on specific scenario setups rather than standardized, formal benchmarks suitable for broader industrial planning contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: The establishment of a standardized benchmark dataset and evaluation protocol for KG-LLM manufacturing agents.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the absolute reliability of automated Cypher query generation and synthesized explanations be ensured for novel operational scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The limitations section states that despite self-correction, reliability "requires ongoing validation, particularly for novel operational scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The system may generate logically inconsistent or incorrect queries when encountering unseen operational patterns or data structures not present in the training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: The development of continuous monitoring procedures and confidence scoring mechanisms that guarantee diagnostic accuracy in production.

## Limitations

- KG schema details are incompletely specified, leaving ambiguity in constraint definitions and indexing strategies
- LLM prompts and few-shot examples for critical modules are not disclosed, making faithful reproduction uncertain
- Exact DES simulation parameters for bottleneck scenarios are not fully specified, preventing precise replication

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Operational query accuracy (Pass@1=0.92, Pass@2=1.00) and human evaluation scores (7.96-9.0/10) for investigative scenarios, as these are directly measured from the implemented system.
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism claims for semantic graph grounding and query decomposition, as they are supported by the reported results but lack detailed ablation studies or alternative comparison baselines.
- **Low Confidence**: The iterative reasoning chain's superiority over fixed analytical pipelines, as the paper does not provide comparative results against non-iterative approaches or systematic analysis of sufficiency threshold impacts.

## Next Checks

1. Validate KG construction on sample DES output: Load simulation logs, verify relationship integrity (e.g., all packages have complete SUPPLIER→WORKER→AGV→FL→STORAGE chains), check timestamp consistency.
2. Benchmark operational query accuracy by entity type: Run the 25 operational questions, categorize failures by resource type (SUPPLIER, WORKER, AGV, FORKLIFT, PACKAGE), identify systematic Cypher generation gaps.
3. Trace investigative reasoning on known bottleneck: Introduce a controlled delay (e.g., specific forklift degraded), run the Reasoning Chain, verify that sub-question sequence logically converges to the injected root cause.
