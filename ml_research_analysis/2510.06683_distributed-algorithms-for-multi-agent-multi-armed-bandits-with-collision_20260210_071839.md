# Distributed Algorithms for Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits with Collision

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.06683
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06683
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Near-optimal group regret O(Σ_{k>M} log T /∆_k), near-optimal individual regret O(1/M · Σ_{k>M} log T /∆_k), and O(log log T) communication cost via adaptive, threshold-triggered communication with differential quantization

## Executive Summary
This paper studies stochastic multiplayer multi-armed bandits (MMAB) with collisions in a fully decentralized setting. The authors propose SynCD, a distributed algorithm that achieves near-optimal group regret O(Σ_{k>M} log T /∆_k), near-optimal individual regret O(1/M · Σ_{k>M} log T /∆_k), and extremely low communication cost O(log log T). The method uses adaptive, threshold-triggered communication with differential quantization to reduce message size, and combines arm elimination with uniform exploitation over accepted arms to ensure fairness and low individual regret. The algorithm outperforms existing baselines in both individual regret and communication efficiency while maintaining strong group performance. The framework is extended to a periodic asynchronous setting, where a distributed algorithm is provided along with a proven lower bound. Experimental results confirm SynCD's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with small reward gaps.

## Method Summary
SynCD uses adaptive, threshold-triggered communication where agents only transmit when their Estimated Confidence Radius (ECR) shrinks by factor β, and use differential quantization of mean estimates. The algorithm combines symmetric elimination-based exploration with uniform round-robin scheduling to ensure fairness. Agents maintain local estimates of arm rewards and confidence intervals, trigger communication when confidence bounds shrink sufficiently, and use forced-collision binary encoding to transmit quantized differences. The INITPHASE orthogonalizes agents and assigns unique ranks, while the main loop cycles through exploration and exploitation phases with arm acceptance/rejection based on UCB/LCB bounds. The approach achieves near-optimal regret with extremely low communication overhead by exchanging only statistically necessary updates.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-optimal group regret O(Σ_{k>M} log T /∆_k) through symmetric elimination and exploration
- Achieves near-optimal individual regret O(1/M · Σ_{k>M} log T /∆_k) via uniform round-robin scheduling
- Reduces communication cost to O(log log T) bits through adaptive threshold-triggered differential quantization
- Outperforms SIC-MMAB baseline in both individual regret and communication efficiency
- Maintains strong performance even with small reward gaps (∆≈10⁻³)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Threshold-Based Differential Communication
The algorithm reduces communication complexity to O(log log T) bits by transmitting only statistically necessary updates. Agents maintain an Estimated Confidence Radius (ECR) and trigger communication only when it shrinks by factor β. They transmit quantized differences between current and previously transmitted estimates, truncating leading zeros to minimize bit-width. This assumes agents remain synchronized in exploration schedules so confidence radii shrink at comparable rates.

### Mechanism 2: Symmetric Elimination-Based Exploration
Distributing learning burden symmetrically among agents minimizes individual regret. Agents operate on fixed cyclic schedule, pulling accepted arms during exploit slots and candidate arms during explore slots. Elimination decisions occur locally based on global aggregates received via communication. Optimal arms are accessed via collision-free round-robin protocol shared by all, assuming homogeneous environment with identical reward distributions for arms.

### Mechanism 3: Forced-Collision Binary Encoding
Enables decentralized coordination without dedicated communication channel by repurposing collision feedback as binary signal. Agents intentionally create collisions to transmit bits - pulling designated arm signals '1', staying idle signals '0'. Assumes perfect collision sensing model where agents reliably detect collisions. This allows bit-encoding through intentional collisions using a signal-then-transmit routine.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) / Confidence Intervals**
  - Why needed: SynCD relies on Estimated Confidence Radius (ECR) to determine when to communicate and uses LCB/UCB bounds to accept or eliminate arms
  - Quick check: If an agent pulls an arm 100 times, does the confidence radius grow or shrink? (Answer: It shrinks)

- **Concept: Multi-Player Bandit Regret Decomposition**
  - Why needed: The paper decomposes Regret into R_init + R_comm + R_explo to understand tradeoffs
  - Quick check: Why does forcing a collision (yielding 0 reward) help reduce total regret in long run? (Answer: Exchanges information that prevents future suboptimal pulls)

- **Concept: Distributed Consensus & Symmetry Breaking**
  - Why needed: INITPHASE uses orthogonalization to assign unique ranks, preventing infinite collisions at startup
  - Quick check: If two agents have exact same internal state/rank, what happens during communication protocol? (Answer: They transmit simultaneously, causing persistent collisions/lockup)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Scheduler (cyclic round-robin) -> Estimator (maintains running mean and counts) -> Communication Manager (quantizer + collision encoder) -> Eliminator (aggregates stats to update Acc/Rej sets)

- **Critical path:** Initialization (orthogonalization + rank assignment) -> Steady State Loop (Pull Arm -> Sense Collision -> Update ECR) -> Trigger Event (ECR < β · prev) -> Comm Burst (Encode δ -> Intentional Collisions -> Update Global μ -> Check Elimination Rules)

- **Design tradeoffs:** β (Threshold Factor) - High β means infrequent communication (lower R_comm) but slower convergence (higher R_explo). Synchronous vs Asynchronous - Core SynCD assumes synchronization, asynchronous version scales regret with LCM of periods.

- **Failure signatures:** Regret flatlines at non-zero (agents stuck in suboptimal fixed point), Regret spikes (linear growth) (communication deadlock or initialization failure), High variance in individual regret (fairness mechanism failing due to agent disagreement on Acc set)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Sanity Check - Run SynCD vs SIC-MMAB on small grid (M=3, K=5), plot Group Regret vs Communication Bits to verify O(log log T) curve. 2) Stress Test (Small Gaps) - Reduce reward gap ∆, observe if adaptive quantization maintains accuracy. 3) Ablation on β - Sweep β ∈ [1.5, 5.0], identify knee where communication savings outweigh regret degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can a theoretically optimal algorithm be designed for the periodic-asynchronous setting that matches the derived regret lower bound?
- Basis: The Conclusion states the proposed asynchronous algorithm does not yet match the proved lower bound, and designing theoretically optimal algorithms under general periodic-asynchronous activation remains important for future work.
- Why unresolved: Gap between proved regret lower bound (Theorem 2) and performance upper bound achieved by proposed asynchronous algorithm (Theorem 3).
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified algorithm with regret analysis showing upper bound that asymptotically matches lower bound Σ 1/Δ̂(i) log T.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the polynomial scaling of communication cost with respect to number of agents (M) and arms (K) be reduced to improve scalability?
- Basis: Remark following Theorem 1 identifies O(KM³) scaling of communication cost as scalability bottleneck in systems with large M or K.
- Why unresolved: Forced-collision protocol causes communication overhead to grow cubically with number of agents, making algorithm potentially impractical for large-scale networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: New communication protocol achieving sub-cubic (linear or logarithmic) scaling in M and K while maintaining near-optimal regret properties.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SynCD framework be extended to general asynchronous settings where agent activations are stochastic or irregular rather than strictly periodic?
- Basis: Section 5.1 defines asynchronous setup based on "periodic activations" to introduce minimal structure, implying more general stochastic asynchrony is not yet solved.
- Why unresolved: Algorithm relies on coordination at Least Common Multiple (LCM) of agent periods, which requires deterministic timing that doesn't exist in stochastic availability models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithm and corresponding regret analysis that remains robust under non-periodic, stochastic agent activity patterns.

## Limitations

- Communication protocol scalability bottleneck with O(KM³) scaling in number of agents and arms, making algorithm impractical for large-scale networks
- Performance guarantees depend critically on maintaining synchronization across agents, which may break down under agent heterogeneity or non-stationary rewards
- Forced-collision binary encoding requires perfect collision sensing and assumes collisions carry no cost beyond lost reward
- Extension to fully asynchronous settings with stochastic agent activations remains unresolved, with current periodic-asynchronous version not matching lower bounds

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Individual regret claim (O(1/M · Σ_{k>M} log T/∆_k)) well-supported by symmetric elimination mechanism and experimental validation showing SynCD outperforming SIC-MMAB
- **Medium Confidence:** Group regret bound (O(Σ_{k>M} log T/∆_k)) appears theoretically sound but proof assumes perfect collision sensing and synchronized confidence radius shrinkage
- **Low Confidence:** O(log log T) communication cost claim is most uncertain - while differential quantization and threshold triggering are clearly specified, limited theoretical analysis under imperfect synchronization

## Next Checks

1. **Communication Robustness Test:** Implement version where agent clocks can drift by 1-5% timing variance. Measure whether communication triggers remain synchronized and whether regret performance degrades gracefully under clock drift.

2. **Heterogeneous Environment Validation:** Modify experimental setup to include arm reward heterogeneity across agents. Verify whether individual regret guarantees break down and measure extent of fairness violations in round-robin scheduling.

3. **Communication Protocol Stress Test:** Implement forced-collision binary encoding with realistic collision detection error rates (1-5% false positives/negatives). Measure impact on communication efficiency and whether quantization errors accumulate to affect arm elimination decisions.
