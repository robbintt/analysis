# Geometric Learning in Black-Box Optimization: A GNN Framework for Algorithm Performance Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16144
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: GNN model achieves up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over RF baselines for predicting modular optimization algorithm performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a graph neural network (GNN) framework for predicting the performance of modular optimization algorithms, addressing the limitation of traditional tabular methods that overlook algorithm configurations. The authors propose representing optimization problems, algorithm configurations, and performance outcomes as nodes in a heterogeneous graph, capturing their complex interdependencies. They focus on two modular frameworks, modCMA-ES and modDE, evaluating 324 and 576 algorithm variants respectively on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem dimensions. The GNN model, based on GraphSAGE and HeteroConv layers, predicts algorithm performance as a regression task. Results show up to 36.6% improvement in mean squared error (MSE) over traditional Random Forest models using only tabular features, with consistent gains across different problem dimensions and runtime budgets.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a heterogeneous graph where nodes represent algorithm parameters, parameter classes, algorithm execution parts, complete algorithms, performance outcomes, and black-box problems. The graph includes five relation types connecting these nodes, with problem nodes initialized using 46 ELA features. A 4-layer HeteroGraphSAGE model with GELU activation performs message passing through relation-specific aggregations followed by cross-relation summation. The model is trained via L1 loss with Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.1, halved on stagnation) using nested leave-instance-out cross-validation. Performance prediction is treated as a regression task, with the model predicting scalar performance values from the performance node embeddings.

## Key Results
- GNN achieves 36.6% improvement in MSE over RF baselines when predicting modCMA-ES performance
- Consistent performance gains observed across different problem dimensions (5D vs 30D) and runtime budgets
- The framework successfully handles 324 modCMA-ES variants and 576 modDE variants across 24 BBOB problems
- GraphSAGE's inductive capabilities enable generalization to new algorithm configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Heterogeneous graph representation captures complex inter-dependencies among problems, algorithms, configurations, and performance outcomes that tabular approaches miss.
- Mechanism: The meta-graph defines 6 node types and 5 relation types with typed edges preserving semantic relationships during learning.
- Core assumption: Performance determinants are relational rather than purely attribute-based.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract explicitly states relationships form a complex structure best represented as a graph; Section 2.1 defines heterogeneous graph with explicit type mappings.
- Break condition: If performance primarily depends on isolated features rather than relational structure, graph gains diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Message-passing GNN layers enable nodes to aggregate information from structurally distant but semantically related entities.
- Mechanism: Each GNN layer performs relation-specific aggregation followed by cross-relation aggregation; stacking 4 layers allows multi-hop information flow.
- Core assumption: Multi-hop relational information improves prediction accuracy beyond direct neighbors.
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.2 explains repeating process over multiple layers enables nodes to capture information from increasingly distant parts; Section 4 shows GNN improves MSE by 0.03-5.19 absolute vs. RF baseline.
- Break condition: If 4 layers capture noise rather than signal, overfitting occurs—regularization (dropout 0.1-0.3) is critical.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GraphSAGE's inductive capability enables generalization to unseen algorithm configurations without retraining.
- Mechanism: GraphSAGE learns aggregation functions rather than fixed embeddings, allowing new nodes to be embedded at inference time using learned neighborhood aggregation rules.
- Core assumption: New configurations share structural patterns with training configurations.
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.2 states GraphSAGE is used for its inductive capabilities; Section 2.2 mentions trained model is capable of generalizing across different algorithm variants.
- Break condition: If novel configurations introduce qualitatively new module types or relation patterns, inductive generalization may fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks**: Why needed here: The model operates on a graph with multiple node and edge types—standard homogeneous GNNs cannot handle this directly. Quick check question: Can you explain why a standard GCN would fail on a graph with 6 node types and 5 edge types?

- **Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) Features**: Why needed here: Problem nodes are initialized with 46 ELA features; understanding what landscape characteristics they encode is essential for debugging feature quality. Quick check question: What does an ELA feature like "dispersion" measure about an optimization landscape?

- **Modular Optimization Frameworks (modCMA-ES, modDE)**: Why needed here: The graph encodes algorithm modules as typed nodes—understanding their functional roles is required to validate edge semantics. Quick check question: What does the "elitism" module control in CMA-ES, and how would it connect to performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (heterogeneous graph with 6 node types, 5 edge types) -> HeteroConv + SageConv layers (×4) -> GELU activation -> Dropout regularization (0.1-0.3) -> Linear output layer predicting scalar performance

- **Critical path**: 1) Benchmark data → ELA feature extraction (via OPTION KB) 2) Graph construction: instantiate meta-graph for each (dimension, budget, algorithm) combination 3) Add reverse edges for bidirectional flow 4) Train GNN via L1 loss with Adam (lr=0.1, decay on stagnation) 5) Evaluate via leave-instance-out nested cross-validation

- **Design tradeoffs**: GraphSAGE vs. GAT/Transformers (authors chose GraphSAGE for inductive learning; attention mechanisms may improve but increase complexity); 4 layers vs. deeper (sufficient to reach all node types; deeper risks over-smoothing); Sum vs. mean cross-relation aggregation (sum preserves relation importance; paper uses sum)

- **Failure signatures**: MSE > RF baseline (check graph connectivity, feature initialization, or hyperparameter mismatch); Training divergence (learning rate 0.1 may be too high—reduce or use learning rate finder); Poor generalization to new algorithm variants (likely missing module types in training data)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce baseline comparison: Train RF on 46 ELA features and GNN on heterogeneous graph for modCMA-ES at 30D, 1000D budget—verify ~36% MSE reduction 2) Ablate graph depth: Run GNN with 1, 2, 3, 4 layers—identify where performance plateaus or degrades 3) Edge direction test: Compare performance with vs. without reverse edges—quantify contribution of bidirectional flow

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can alternative GNN architectures, such as graph attention networks or graph transformers, further enhance predictive performance compared to the GraphSAGE model used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly suggests "exploring alternative GNN architectures beyond GraphSAGE, such as graph attention networks or graph transformers" as a promising direction.
- Why unresolved: The current study restricted its experimental evaluation solely to the GraphSAGE architecture to demonstrate proof-of-concept.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative benchmarking showing MSE scores of attention-based or transformer-based GNNs against the GraphSAGE baseline on the same modCMA-ES and modDE datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can this framework be extended to non-modular optimization algorithms that lack a standardized vocabulary of components?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify "extending this approach to non-modular algorithms" as a "key challenge ahead" requiring a "standardized vocabulary."
- Why unresolved: The current heterogeneous graph structure depends heavily on the explicit modular decomposition inherent to modCMA-ES and modDE.
- What evidence would resolve it: A methodology for abstracting components from non-modular code and successful performance prediction results on algorithms not originally designed with modular switches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which specific nodes, relations, and input features most significantly influence the performance predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Explainability methods like GNNExplainer can provide insights into which nodes, relations, and features most influence predictions."
- Why unresolved: The current work focuses on optimizing predictive accuracy (MSE) but does not analyze the internal decision-making processes or feature importances within the learned model.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study applying GNNExplainer (or similar tools) to the trained models to identify and quantify the structural and feature-based contributions to the predicted performance scores.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks direct ablation studies isolating the contribution of heterogeneous graph structure versus feature quality
- Inductive generalization claims remain theoretical without experimental validation on truly novel algorithm configurations
- No experiments demonstrate performance on configurations containing module types or parameter classes not present during training

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The empirical superiority of GNN over RF baselines (36.6% MSE improvement) is well-supported by reported results across multiple algorithm frameworks and problem settings
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism by which heterogeneous graph representation captures complex interdependencies is plausible but not directly validated through controlled experiments
- **Low Confidence**: The inductive generalization claims lack empirical validation—no experiments demonstrate performance on algorithm configurations outside the training distribution

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study**: Compare GNN performance against a modified RF baseline that includes explicit relational features (e.g., parameter-algorithm interaction terms) to isolate the benefit of graph structure versus feature engineering

2. **Inductive Generalization Test**: Hold out entire parameter classes or algorithm modules during training, then evaluate GNN performance on configurations containing these novel components to validate inductive capabilities

3. **Graph Depth Analysis**: Systematically evaluate GNN performance across 1-6 layers to identify optimal depth and determine whether multi-hop aggregation genuinely improves predictions or merely adds complexity
