# Generative Anchored Fields: Controlled Data Generation via Emergent Velocity Fields and Transport Algebra

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.22693
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22693
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: Introduces GAF with compositional control via endpoint predictors, achieving FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ 64×64 while uniquely enabling lossless cyclic transport (LPIPS=0.0)

## Executive Summary
Generative Anchored Fields (GAF) introduces a novel paradigm for controlled data generation by learning independent endpoint predictors J (noise) and K (data) rather than trajectory predictors. The velocity field v=K-J emerges from their time-conditioned disagreement, enabling Transport Algebra - algebraic operations on learned heads for compositional control. With class-specific K heads, GAF supports directed transport maps between a shared base distribution and multiple modalities, enabling controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic.

## Method Summary
GAF trains twin heads (J, K) to predict endpoints of a diffusion bridge rather than a trajectory. The velocity field v=K-J emerges as the disagreement between heads and is integrated via Euler ODE. A swap loss enforces time-antisymmetry for lossless cyclic transport. Transport Algebra allows vector arithmetic between K heads for compositional generation across modalities.

## Key Results
- Achieves FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ 64×64 with single-step Euler sampling
- Demonstrates lossless cyclic transport between classes with LPIPS=0.0
- Enables controlled interpolation and hybrid generation through Transport Algebra operations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core insight is that learning independent endpoint predictors J and K, rather than a trajectory predictor, allows the velocity field to emerge as their disagreement. This emergent field encodes the transport map between noise and data distributions. The swap loss enforces time-antisymmetry, ensuring reversibility. Transport Algebra works because velocity fields compose linearly when endpoints are learned independently.

## Foundational Learning
- **Endpoint prediction**: Learning J (noise endpoint) and K (data endpoint) independently rather than trajectory prediction - needed because it enables emergent velocity fields with compositional properties
- **Velocity field emergence**: The field v=K-J arises naturally from head disagreement - needed because it encodes the transport map without explicit trajectory supervision
- **Transport Algebra**: Vector arithmetic on velocity fields for controlled composition - needed because it provides a mathematical framework for semantic manipulation
- **Time-antisymmetric training**: Swap loss enforcing v(x,t) = -v(x,1-t) - needed because it guarantees lossless cyclic transport
- **Bridge sampling**: x_t = (1-t)z_y + t·z_x for training - needed because it provides the interpolation path between endpoints
- **Euler ODE integration**: Simple numerical solver for velocity field integration - needed because it enables efficient sampling from the emergent field

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Trunk (Φ) -> J Head & K Heads -> Velocity Calculator (v=K-J) -> ODE Solver -> Data

**Critical path:** For inference: Noise z_y -> Trunk Φ -> J & K heads -> Velocity v -> ODE Solver -> Data z_x. For training: includes forward pass plus additional swap pass at time 1-t to compute L_swap loss.

**Design tradeoffs:** More Euler steps improve quality but slow sampling. More K heads increase compositional ability but also memory/computation. λ_res and λ_swap hyperparameters trade off endpoint accuracy vs transport consistency.

**Failure signatures:**
- Blurry samples: too few ODE steps or unstable trunk
- Garbled composition: K heads learned misaligned latent manifolds
- Non-reversible cycles: insufficient swap loss weighting or ODE instability

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Train single J/K head on simple dataset (MNIST/CelebA subset) and verify sample generation
2. Train multi-class model (AFHQ) and demonstrate class interpolation via velocity blending
3. Perform cyclic transport (A→B→A) and verify LPIPS≈0 reconstruction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Video generation potential**: Can Transport Algebra be reformulated as "Motion Algebra" to control temporal dynamics in video generation? The paper intends to explore this for stable, controllable video generation.
- **Scalability limits**: Does the shared trunk architecture bottleneck performance when scaled to thousands of class-specific K heads (e.g., full ImageNet)? Current experiments limited to 3-10 classes.
- **Single-step generation**: Can training be modified to achieve high-fidelity generation using strictly single-step Euler integration? Current peak performance requires 250 steps despite theoretical capability.

## Limitations
- Architectural hyperparameters (DiT dimensions, sampling schedules) are underspecified
- Theoretical understanding of why Transport Algebra preserves information remains limited
- Empirical validation beyond small-scale datasets and limited class numbers

## Confidence
**High Confidence:**
- Core architectural design is clearly specified and reproducible
- FID scores on standard benchmarks are verifiable
- Compositional generation capability is demonstrated

**Medium Confidence:**
- Lossless cyclic transport property depends on precise hyperparameter tuning
- Transport Algebra as general framework requires broader validation

**Low Confidence:**
- Claim of "fundamental shift" from trajectory-based learning is somewhat speculative

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study on swap loss: Train with λ_swap=0 and measure degradation in cyclic transport (LPIPS) to quantify reversibility contribution
2. Compositional generation limits: Systematically test interpolation between >2 classes to evaluate performance degradation with composition complexity
3. Theoretical analysis: Derive formal conditions under which swap loss guarantees time-antisymmetric velocity fields, proving lossless transport property mathematically
