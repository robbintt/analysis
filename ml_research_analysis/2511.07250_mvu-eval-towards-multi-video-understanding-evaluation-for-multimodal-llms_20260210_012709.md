core_contribution: This paper introduces MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark
  designed to evaluate Multi-Video Understanding (MVU) capabilities of Multimodal
  Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on single-video
  analysis, MVU-Eval addresses the critical need for models to process and reason
  across multiple video sources simultaneously.

# MVU-Eval: Towards Multi-Video Understanding Evaluation for Multimodal LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07250
- Reference count: 23
- Introduces first comprehensive benchmark for Multi-Video Understanding evaluation

## Executive Summary
MVU-Eval addresses a critical gap in multimodal AI evaluation by introducing the first comprehensive benchmark for Multi-Video Understanding (MVU) capabilities. Unlike existing single-video benchmarks, this framework evaluates how Multimodal Large Language Models process and reason across multiple video sources simultaneously. The benchmark comprises 1,824 question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, assessing eight core competencies essential for real-world multi-video reasoning applications.

Extensive evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art models reveals significant performance limitations, with even the best model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving only 56.6% accuracy. Most open-source models score below 50%, demonstrating substantial room for improvement. The study identifies key challenges including cross-video alignment difficulties, spatial reasoning limitations, and temporal understanding deficits, establishing a crucial foundation for advancing MVU capabilities in multimodal AI systems.

## Method Summary
MVU-Eval introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework specifically designed to evaluate Multi-Video Understanding capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models. The benchmark includes 1,824 carefully curated question-answer pairs across 4,959 videos from diverse domains, testing eight core competencies: object recognition, spatial understanding, counting, comparison, knowledge-intensive reasoning, in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and temporal reasoning. The evaluation systematically tests 27 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, revealing significant performance gaps and identifying key areas where current MLLMs struggle with multi-video reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Top-performing model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only 56.6% accuracy, with most open-source models scoring below 50%
- Performance degrades significantly as the number of videos increases, demonstrating the "Multi-Video Effect"
- Larger models generally perform better, but substantial gaps remain in cross-video alignment, spatial reasoning, and temporal understanding capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its multi-dimensional approach to evaluating video comprehension. By requiring models to process multiple simultaneous video streams, MVU-Eval forces the development of cross-video alignment capabilities that single-video benchmarks cannot test. The diversity of domains and competency types ensures models must demonstrate genuine understanding rather than memorizing patterns, while the large question-answer pair set provides statistical significance to performance measurements.

## Foundational Learning
The benchmark builds upon established multimodal learning principles by extending single-modality evaluation frameworks to multi-video contexts. It leverages the success of existing question-answering benchmarks while introducing novel challenges specific to video stream processing. The competency categorization draws from cognitive science research on human visual reasoning, providing a theoretically grounded foundation for assessing machine understanding of dynamic visual content across multiple sources.

## Architecture Onboarding
MVU-Eval is designed to be compatible with standard multimodal transformer architectures without requiring specialized modifications. The benchmark inputs consist of standard video formats that can be processed by existing video encoding pipelines, and the question-answer format aligns with typical instruction-tuning paradigms. This accessibility enables rapid adoption across the research community while providing a consistent evaluation standard for comparing different architectural approaches to multi-video understanding.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several critical open questions for future research. How can models better maintain temporal consistency when reasoning across multiple video streams? What architectural innovations are needed to improve cross-video alignment capabilities? How should evaluation metrics evolve to capture nuanced aspects of multi-video understanding beyond simple accuracy? The authors also question whether current benchmarks adequately represent real-world complexity and whether performance on synthetic multi-video tasks translates to practical applications.

## Limitations
- Performance gap between top models (56.6% accuracy) and human-level understanding remains substantial
- Benchmark may not fully represent real-world complexity or edge cases in multi-video reasoning scenarios
- Temporal reasoning appears particularly challenging, with models struggling to maintain temporal consistency across multiple video streams
- The curated nature of question-answer pairs may not capture the full spectrum of real-world multi-video reasoning scenarios
- Evaluation relies on predefined correct answers, potentially missing nuanced or context-dependent interpretations

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Performance degradation with increasing numbers of videos is strongly supported by systematic testing across 27 models
- Medium Confidence: Cross-video alignment difficulties are observed but may be influenced by model-specific training data biases
- Medium Confidence: Comprehensiveness claim is supported by diverse domain coverage, though relative weighting of competencies remains somewhat subjective

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing specific video features (audio, resolution, frame rate) to isolate modality contributions to performance degradation
2. Implement human evaluation studies comparing model responses to expert judgments on a subset of questions
3. Test model performance on dynamically generated multi-video scenarios with controlled complexity parameters
4. Analyze error patterns to identify specific competency areas requiring architectural innovations
5. Develop extended benchmark versions incorporating more realistic multi-video scenarios from real-world applications
