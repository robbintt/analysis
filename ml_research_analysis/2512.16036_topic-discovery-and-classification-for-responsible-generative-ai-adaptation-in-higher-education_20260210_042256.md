# Topic Discovery and Classification for Responsible Generative AI Adaptation in Higher Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16036
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16036
- Reference count: 40
- Scalable system for topic discovery and classification of generative AI policies in higher education using BERTopic and GPT-4.0

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a scalable system for topic discovery and classification of generative AI policies in higher education settings. The authors developed an approach combining unsupervised topic modeling (BERTopic) with LLM-based classification (GPT-4.0) to analyze AI-related policy statements from course syllabi and institutional websites. The system achieved strong performance metrics including a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery and classification precision/recall ranging from 0.92-0.97 and 0.85-0.97 across eight policy categories. This tool helps institutions interpret and standardize AI policies, supporting responsible AI integration in educational settings.

## Method Summary
The authors employed a two-stage approach for policy analysis. First, they used BERTopic for unsupervised topic modeling to discover latent topics within the corpus of AI-related policy statements. Second, they leveraged GPT-4.0 to classify policy statements into predefined categories through zero-shot classification. The system was trained and evaluated on a dataset of AI policy statements extracted from course syllabi and institutional websites, demonstrating the ability to identify and categorize policy content at scale.

## Key Results
- Achieved coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery using BERTopic
- Classification precision ranging from 0.92-0.97 across eight policy categories
- Classification recall ranging from 0.85-0.97, demonstrating reliable policy categorization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining complementary strengths of topic modeling and large language models. BERTopic's unsupervised approach effectively discovers latent semantic structures in policy text without requiring labeled training data, while GPT-4.0's zero-shot classification capability enables accurate categorization of policies into predefined frameworks. This hybrid approach leverages the pattern recognition strengths of transformer-based models while maintaining interpretability through structured topic discovery.

## Foundational Learning
1. **BERTopic topic modeling** - why needed: to discover latent semantic structures in unlabeled policy documents; quick check: coherence score > 0.7 indicates meaningful topics
2. **Zero-shot classification with LLMs** - why needed: to categorize policies without extensive labeled training data; quick check: high precision (>0.9) on held-out test set
3. **Transformer-based document embeddings** - why needed: to capture semantic relationships between policy statements; quick check: similar documents have high cosine similarity in embedding space
4. **Policy document preprocessing** - why needed: to normalize diverse policy formats and remove noise; quick check: consistent tokenization and cleaning across document types

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Policy Documents -> BERTopic (Topic Discovery) -> GPT-4.0 (Classification) -> Policy Categories

**Critical Path**: Document ingestion → Text preprocessing → BERTopic topic modeling → Zero-shot classification → Category assignment

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- BERTopic vs LDA for topic modeling: BERTopic offers better semantic understanding but higher computational cost
- GPT-4.0 vs fine-tuned smaller models: GPT-4.0 provides better generalization but higher inference cost
- Unsupervised vs supervised learning: avoids labeling burden but may miss domain-specific nuances

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low coherence scores indicate poor topic separation or noisy input
- Classification precision drops suggest topic model misalignment with policy categories
- High variance across categories indicates imbalanced category definitions

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test topic discovery on synthetic policy documents with known topics
2. Evaluate classification on held-out test set with manual verification
3. Assess system performance on policy documents from different educational contexts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on narrow corpus of AI-related policy statements, limiting generalizability
- Classification performance shows variability across categories, with recall ranging from 0.85-0.97
- Use of GPT-4.0 raises concerns about reproducibility and cost scalability

## Confidence
- Topic modeling and coherence results: **High confidence**
- Classification precision and recall: **Medium confidence**
- Scalability and generalizability claims: **Low confidence**

## Next Checks
1. Test the classification system on policy documents from diverse institutional contexts (e.g., K-12, professional education, international institutions) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate model performance using different LLM versions or open-source alternatives to ensure reproducibility
3. Conduct user studies with policy administrators to assess practical utility and identify edge cases the system may miss
