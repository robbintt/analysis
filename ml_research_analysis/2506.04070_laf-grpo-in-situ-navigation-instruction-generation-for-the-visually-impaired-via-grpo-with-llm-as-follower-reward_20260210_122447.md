## Executive Summary
LaF-GRPO introduces a two-stage training framework for navigation instruction generation tailored to visually impaired users. It combines supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using an LLM-as-follower mechanism to simulate user comprehension and provide feedback rewards. The method emphasizes spatial accuracy (direction/distance) over safety alerts in reward weighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the NIG4VI dataset.

## Method Summary
LaF-GRPO employs a two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the NIG4VI dataset to establish baseline instruction generation capability; second, GRPO fine-tuning guided by multi-component rewards. The reward function combines format adherence, METEOR, and a custom LaF reward that prioritizes directional and distance accuracy over hazard alerts. An LLM (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct) is fine-tuned to act as an action interpreter, parsing generated instructions into structured actions (direction, distance, hazard alert) for reward computation. The approach uses Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B as the VLM backbone, with LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- SFT+(LaF-GRPO) consistently outperforms SFT-only across all metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, SPICE) on both 3B and 7B models
- Ablation study confirms LaF reward component contributes measurable gains beyond format + METEOR alone
- 7B model achieves higher METEOR/SPICE (better linguistic diversity) while 3B excels at BLEU/ROUGE (lexical matching)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Simulating VI user responses via an LLM action interpreter provides navigational feedback signals without costly real-world human trials. A text-only LLM is fine-tuned to parse navigation instructions into structured action interpretations—direction (clock position), distance, and hazard alert flags. These are compared against ground-truth reference actions to compute an exact-match reward. The core assumption is that the action interpreter's structured outputs are valid proxies for actual VI user comprehension and navigation success.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-component GRPO rewards with navigational weighting prioritize spatial accuracy over secondary features. The LaF reward weights direction and distance at 0.4 each, hazard alerts at 0.2, reflecting that "spatial factors play a direct and critical role in determining navigation success" while alerts are "supplementary support." The core assumption is that the (0.4, 0.4, 0.2) weighting correctly reflects the relative importance of spatial vs. safety information for VI navigation.

### Mechanism 3
Two-stage training (SFT warm-up → GRPO exploration) yields better instruction quality than either alone. SFT establishes baseline generation capability; GRPO then optimizes via group-relative advantages computed from the combined reward signals, with KL regularization preventing capability loss. The core assumption is that the GRPO objective with clipped surrogate and KL penalty effectively balances exploration against catastrophic forgetting.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
  - Why needed here: Core RL algorithm replacing human feedback collection with group-based advantage estimation.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how GRPO computes advantages using only within-group rewards rather than an external value function?

- **Concept: Speaker-Follower Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: LaF-GRPO instantiates this—VLM as "speaker" generating instructions, LLM as "follower" simulating user interpretation.
  - Quick check question: How does the follower's feedback loop differ from traditional RLHF with human annotators?

- **Concept: Clock-Position Direction Encoding**
  - Why needed here: Direction outputs use clock positions (e.g., "12 o'clock") rather than degrees for VI accessibility.
  - Quick check question: Why might clock positions be preferred over cardinal directions or degrees for VI users?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Front-view image + Pose data → VLM (Qwen2.5-VL) → Navigation instruction
                                              ↓
  Instruction → Action Interpreter (LLaMA-3-8B) → Structured action JSON
                                              ↓
  (Action JSON, Ground truth) → Reward functions (Format, METEOR, LaF)
                                              ↓
  Rewards → GRPO optimizer → Updated VLM weights (via LoRA)

- **Critical path:** Action interpreter training → SFT warm-up on NIG4VI → GRPO fine-tuning with multi-component rewards. The interpreter must achieve >98% parse accuracy before GRPO begins.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Pre-calculation vs. no pre-calculation: Pre-calc provides distance/direction, reducing VLM burden but testing reasoning less.
  - 3B vs. 7B models: 3B excels at BLEU/ROUGE; 7B better at METEOR/SPICE (more linguistic diversity).
  - Group size G=8: Larger groups improve advantage estimation but increase compute.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Instructions with visual-only descriptors (e.g., "red car") → format reward passes, usability fails.
  - Missing safety alerts in high-risk scenes → LaF reward penalizes; check alert weight (0.2).
  - Parse errors from action interpreter → verify >98% accuracy threshold met.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Zero-(LaF-GRPO) on NIG4VI test split to validate reward pipeline before SFT investment.
  2. Ablate each reward component (format-only, +METEOR, +LaF) to confirm Table 3 patterns.
  3. Test interpreter generalization on out-of-distribution instruction styles before full GRPO run.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does LaF-GRPO's performance transfer from the CARLA simulation environment to real-world navigation scenarios with actual VI users? (The authors state in Limitations: "This study's reliance on simulation and proxy users... introduces limitations. Future work could explore real-world dataset collection and direct engagement with VI users.")
- How faithfully does the LLM-based action interpreter simulate actual VI user interpretation of navigation instructions? (The action interpreter achieves 98% parse accuracy on format, but the paper provides no validation that its predicted actions match how real VI users would interpret and act on instructions.)
- What is the optimal configuration of reward weights (w_dir, w_dist, w_alert) for VI navigation instruction generation? (Weights (0.4, 0.4, 0.2) were set "based on analysis of navigation failure factors," but no systematic ablation over weight combinations was conducted.)

## Limitations
- The method relies on simulation data and proxy users rather than real-world validation with actual VI individuals
- The optimal reward weight configuration (0.4, 0.4, 0.2) was empirically chosen without systematic ablation studies
- The action interpreter's outputs may not correlate with actual VI navigation comprehension without human validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** SFT warm-up followed by GRPO improves instruction quality over SFT alone (Table 2 patterns are consistent)
- **Medium confidence:** Multi-component rewards with navigational weighting are appropriate (supported by navigation literature but not directly validated for this weighting)
- **Low confidence:** Action interpreter outputs reliably simulate VI user navigation comprehension without human validation

## Next Checks
1. Recruit 3-5 VI users to test instructions generated with and without LaF-GRPO. Measure task completion time and error rates to verify the reward pipeline correlates with actual navigation success.
2. Run the action interpreter on out-of-distribution instruction styles (e.g., from other VLM datasets) to check parse accuracy degrades below 98%, which would invalidate the GRPO reward signal.
3. Re-run LaF-GRPO with hazard alert weight varied (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) across both indoor and outdoor scenes to verify the 0.2 default is robust to different environmental risk profiles.
