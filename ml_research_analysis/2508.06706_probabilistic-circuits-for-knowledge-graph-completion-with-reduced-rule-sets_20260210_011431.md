# Probabilistic Circuits for Knowledge Graph Completion with Reduced Rule Sets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06706
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06706
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Achieves 70-96% rule reduction with 31× performance improvement over confidence-based baselines while maintaining 91% of peak performance

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of excessive rule sets in knowledge graph completion, where traditional rule-based methods suffer from thousands of redundant rules that undermine explainability. The authors propose a probabilistic circuit (PC) framework that learns distributions over meaningful rule contexts, enabling significant rule reduction without sacrificing performance. Their approach leverages probabilistic circuits to identify and prioritize the most informative rules for each query context, achieving up to 12-fold rule reduction while delivering 31× speedup over baseline methods. The method is validated across 8 benchmark datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to confidence-based rule selection approaches.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates rule learning, context extraction, probabilistic circuit construction, and rule selection into a unified pipeline. First, non-ground rules are learned from the knowledge graph using AnyBURL with specified learning time and support thresholds. Then, PyClause performs abductive reasoning to generate rule-context associations from training triples, creating a binary matrix linking rules to contexts. Hidden Chow-Liu Tree structures are learned using the Juice library with EM parameter learning to build the probabilistic circuit. Finally, rule sets are generated through either singleton selection (using PC1 or PC2) or greedy walk methods (PC3), with query probabilities computed through different PC implementations. The framework is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets using standard ranking metrics and rule reduction ratios.

## Key Results
- Achieves 70-96% reduction in rule sets compared to confidence-based baselines (average 12-fold reduction)
- Delivers 31× performance improvement in rule set generation time over baseline methods
- Maintains 91% of peak baseline performance even with minimal rule sets
- PC1 and PC2 singleton methods complete in <100 seconds for 2600 rules, while PC3 greedy walk can take >24 hours for larger rule sets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by learning probabilistic distributions over rule contexts rather than treating all rules equally. Traditional approaches use confidence scores to select rules, but this ignores the specific contexts in which rules apply. By learning a probabilistic circuit over rule-context associations, the framework can identify which rules are most informative for each query context, enabling selective rule application. This context-aware approach allows for dramatic rule reduction while preserving or improving performance, as only the most relevant rules are used for each inference task.

## Foundational Learning
- Probabilistic Circuits: Why needed - provide tractable inference over complex distributions without independence assumptions; Quick check - verify marginals sum to 1
- Hidden Chow-Liu Tree: Why needed - efficient structure learning for tree-structured PCs; Quick check - confirm tree structure has no cycles
- Abductive Reasoning: Why needed - extract rule-context associations from training data; Quick check - verify binary matrix dimensions match rule and context counts
- EM Parameter Learning: Why needed - learn PC parameters from observed rule usage patterns; Quick check - confirm parameter convergence across iterations
- Marginals in PCs: Why needed - enable efficient rule selection via singleton or greedy methods; Quick check - verify singleton marginals align with greedy walk selections

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** AnyBURL -> PyClause -> Binary Matrix -> Juice (PC Learning) -> Marginals -> Rule Selection -> AnyBURL Engine

**Critical Path:** Rule Learning → Context Extraction → PC Construction → Rule Selection → Inference → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational complexity in PC construction for reduced rule sets and faster inference. While PC3 greedy walk provides optimal rule selection, its computational cost (>24 hours) makes PC1/PC2 singleton methods more practical for large rule sets despite potentially suboptimal performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Baseline methods show zero performance at low rule counts (particularly in WN18), which the PC methods are designed to overcome. Computational explosion occurs with PC3 greedy walk on large rule sets (>10k rules).

**First Experiments:**
1. Run PC1 singleton method on FB15K-237 with 1000 rules to verify sub-100 second execution time and 70% rule reduction
2. Compare PC2 exact inference against PC1 lower bound on CODEX-S dataset to validate performance gap claims
3. Test PyClause context extraction on Kinship dataset to verify binary matrix generation matches expected dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- PC3 greedy walk method has prohibitive computational requirements (>24 hours for 10k-15k rules), limiting its practical applicability
- The method requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters across different components (rule learning time, support thresholds, EM iterations)
- Performance gains are dataset-dependent, with some datasets showing more dramatic improvements than others

## Confidence
- Rule learning methodology: High
- Probabilistic circuit construction: High
- Performance improvement claims: Medium (dependent on correct implementation of underspecified components)
- Computational efficiency claims: Medium (based on reported scaling patterns)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the binary matrix generation using PyClause with abductive reasoning on a single dataset, comparing rule-context associations against paper specifications
2. Implement Hidden Chow-Liu Tree structure learning with varied depth limits (3-10) to identify hyperparameter sensitivity and verify convergence patterns
3. Run PC1 and PC2 singleton methods on FB15K-237 with 1000 rules to verify reported execution times and rule reduction performance
