# Can Large Language Models Solve Engineering Equations? A Systematic Comparison of Direct Prediction and Solver-Assisted Approaches

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.01774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01774
- Authors: Sai Varun Kodathala; Rakesh Vunnam
- Reference count: 1
- Primary result: Solver-assisted computation achieves 67.9-81.8% lower error than direct prediction for transcendental equations

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates two approaches for using large language models (LLMs) to solve transcendental engineering equations: direct numerical prediction and solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate equations while numerical methods compute solutions. The study tests six state-of-the-art models across 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains. Results demonstrate that solver-assisted approaches significantly outperform direct prediction, with mean relative errors of 0.225-0.301 compared to 0.765-1.262 for direct prediction. The findings suggest LLMs function best as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines for precision-critical tasks.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates six state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-3, Claude-2, Gemini-Pro, Llama-3) on 100 transcendental engineering equations across seven domains. Two approaches are compared: direct prediction where LLMs generate numerical solutions, and solver-assisted computation where LLMs provide symbolic formulations and initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration computes solutions. Problems cover beam deflection, heat transfer, circuit analysis, and other engineering applications. Performance is measured using mean relative error across all problems, with statistical analysis across different model types and engineering domains.

## Key Results
- Solver-assisted computation achieves 67.9-81.8% lower mean relative error than direct prediction
- Domain-specific improvements vary widely: Electronics shows 93.1% error reduction while Fluid Mechanics shows only 7.2%
- Across all domains, solver-assisted approach achieves mean relative errors of 0.225-0.301 versus 0.765-1.262 for direct prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic. This suggests their optimal deployment is as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.

## Foundational Learning
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: Root-finding algorithm using iterative approximation; needed for numerical solution computation; quick check: verify convergence criteria and iteration limits
- **Transcendental Equations**: Equations involving transcendental functions (exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric); needed as problem domain; quick check: identify function types in test problems
- **Mean Relative Error**: Performance metric comparing predicted to actual values; needed for quantitative evaluation; quick check: calculate sample error for verification
- **Symbolic Manipulation**: LLMs' ability to represent equations algebraically; needed for solver-assisted approach; quick check: verify equation formulation accuracy
- **Domain Knowledge Retrieval**: LLMs' capacity to apply engineering principles; needed for problem understanding; quick check: validate physics assumptions in formulations
- **Numerical Precision**: Accuracy requirements for engineering calculations; needed to evaluate performance differences; quick check: compare significant digits in solutions

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: LLMs (symbolic formulation) -> Initial Conditions -> Newton-Raphson Solver -> Numerical Solution
- **Critical Path**: Problem understanding → Symbolic formulation → Initial condition specification → Numerical iteration → Solution convergence
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Computational speed (direct prediction) vs accuracy (solver-assisted); model complexity vs domain specificity; token usage vs solution precision
- **Failure Signatures**: Direct prediction: systematic bias in exponential calculations; Solver-assisted: poor initial conditions causing divergence
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test LLMs on pure symbolic manipulation without numerical computation
  2. Evaluate initial condition quality impact on solver convergence
  3. Compare different numerical solvers with same LLM formulations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to transcendental equations, excluding algebraic systems and differential equations
- Only Newton-Raphson method tested, potentially limiting generalizability to other numerical approaches
- No computational efficiency analysis comparing wall-clock time and resource usage between approaches

## Confidence
- High confidence in primary finding that solver-assisted approaches outperform direct prediction across all tested domains
- Medium confidence in claims about LLM arithmetic limitations based on empirical observation
- Medium confidence in domain-specific performance variations due to potential pretraining data effects

## Next Checks
1. **Alternative Solver Comparison**: Repeat experiments using multiple numerical methods (bisection, secant, Brent's method) to determine if error reduction patterns persist across different iterative algorithms and identify optimal solver-domain pairings.

2. **Efficiency Analysis**: Measure wall-clock time, memory usage, and token consumption for both approaches across problem sets, focusing on solver convergence behavior and LLM response patterns for different equation complexities.

3. **Generalization Testing**: Evaluate solver-assisted approach on non-transcendental problems including systems of linear equations, nonlinear algebraic equations, and ordinary differential equations to establish broader applicability beyond current scope.
