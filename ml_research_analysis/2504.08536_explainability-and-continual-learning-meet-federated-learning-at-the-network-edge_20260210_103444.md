# Explainability and Continual Learning meet Federated Learning at the Network Edge
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.08536
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08536
- Reference count: 26
- One-line primary result: Presents unified modeling framework integrating XAI, FL, and CL at network edge addressing accuracy-explainability trade-offs, distributed decision trees, and continual learning with replay buffers

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating Explainable AI (XAI), Federated Learning (FL), and Continual Learning (CL) in edge computing environments. The framework addresses three critical challenges: balancing predictive accuracy with model interpretability through Multi-Objective Optimization, training interpretable decision trees in distributed settings where non-differentiable structures complicate gradient-based optimization, and implementing CL with replay buffers under resource constraints and non-stationary data distributions. The work emphasizes privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and model interpretability as essential requirements for trustworthy AI services at the network edge, with practical implications for domains like healthcare diagnostics.

The authors present adaptive buffer management strategies, explore centralized versus decentralized replay buffer architectures, and develop optimization formulations for both FL and distributed settings. By addressing the unique constraints of edge environments—including limited computational resources, privacy requirements, and communication bandwidth—the framework aims to enable continuous model adaptation while maintaining transparency and trustworthiness in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The framework employs Multi-Objective Optimization to jointly optimize complex models and surrogate models for balancing accuracy and explainability in FL settings. For inherently interpretable decision trees, the approach tackles the challenge of non-differentiable structures in distributed environments through novel optimization formulations. Continual Learning with replay buffers is implemented using adaptive buffer management strategies that address resource constraints and non-stationary data distributions across clients. The framework explores both centralized and decentralized replay buffer architectures, with specific optimization formulations developed for each setting to enable continuous model adaptation while preserving privacy and minimizing communication overhead.

## Key Results
- Framework addresses three key challenges: accuracy-explainability trade-offs, distributed decision tree training, and CL with replay buffers
- Proposes adaptive buffer management strategies for resource-constrained edge environments
- Develops optimization formulations for both FL and distributed settings
- Emphasizes privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and model interpretability as critical requirements
- Highlights practical implications for healthcare diagnostics and similar domains requiring trustworthy AI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by recognizing that edge environments require simultaneous optimization of multiple competing objectives: model accuracy, interpretability, privacy preservation, and resource efficiency. By employing Multi-Objective Optimization, it can balance complex model performance with surrogate model explainability. The adaptive buffer management addresses the temporal dynamics of non-stationary data distributions, while the exploration of both centralized and decentralized replay architectures provides flexibility for different edge deployment scenarios. The integration of these three AI paradigms acknowledges that modern edge applications require models that are not only accurate and continuously adaptive but also transparent and trustworthy.

- Interpretable Machine Learning methods: Approaches for making complex models transparent and explainable; needed to ensure model decisions can be understood by end-users; quick check: verify knowledge of LIME, SHAP, and inherently interpretable models
- Edge computing constraints: Limited computational resources, bandwidth constraints, and privacy requirements; needed to contextualize the framework's design decisions; quick check: confirm understanding of edge vs cloud computing trade-offs
- Non-differentiable optimization techniques: Methods for optimizing models with discrete or non-differentiable components; needed to address decision tree training challenges; quick check: validate knowledge of evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning approaches

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Client devices -> Federated Aggregator -> Global Model -> Local Surrogate Models -> Explainability Layer -> Replay Buffer Manager -> Continual Learning Module
Critical path: Data stream → Client device processing → Local model updates → Federated aggregation → Global model synchronization → Local adaptation with replay buffers → Explainability generation
Design tradeoffs: Centralized vs decentralized replay buffers (communication efficiency vs privacy), complex vs surrogate models (accuracy vs interpretability), adaptive vs fixed buffer management (flexibility vs computational overhead)
Failure signatures: Communication bottlenecks in federated aggregation, buffer overflow/underflow in CL, surrogate model accuracy degradation, decision tree optimization convergence failure
First experiments: 1) Benchmark MOO accuracy-explainability trade-off across heterogeneous edge devices, 2) Compare centralized vs decentralized replay buffer performance under non-stationary data streams, 3) Test decision tree optimization in distributed FL environment for convergence and practicality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Practical feasibility of MOO-based optimization in resource-constrained edge environments remains uncertain
- Adaptive buffer management strategies lack empirical validation across diverse non-stationary distributions
- No concrete performance benchmarks comparing centralized versus decentralized replay buffer architectures
- Decision tree optimization in distributed settings remains largely theoretical without practical implementation validation
- Treatment of inherently interpretable models lacks discussion of real-world implementation challenges

## Confidence
- Overall framework design: Medium (conceptually sound but lacks comprehensive empirical validation)
- Privacy preservation claims: Low to Medium (mentioned but not quantitatively evaluated)
- Communication efficiency claims: Low to Medium (discussed but without baseline comparisons)
- Applicability to healthcare domains: Plausible but speculative (no domain-specific testing)

## Next Checks
1. Empirical evaluation of MOO-based accuracy-explainability trade-off across multiple edge devices with varying computational capabilities
2. Comparative analysis of centralized versus decentralized replay buffer performance under realistic non-stationary data streams
3. Implementation and testing of proposed decision tree optimization approach in distributed FL environment to assess practical viability
