# Relative Entropy Regularized Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Encrypted Policy Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12358
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12358
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Presents Encrypted RERL framework integrating RERL with FHE for privacy-preserving policy synthesis

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Encrypted RERL, a novel framework that combines relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RERL) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to enable privacy-preserving policy synthesis. The key innovation lies in leveraging RERL's linear and min-free structure, which allows for efficient encrypted computation without intermediate re-encryption steps required by existing approaches. The framework addresses the critical challenge of outsourcing sensitive RL computations to untrusted servers while maintaining data privacy through cryptographic techniques.

The authors provide theoretical analysis of error propagation from encryption-induced errors, including quantization and bootstrapping, and establish convergence bounds for the encrypted policy synthesis process. Numerical experiments on Grid-World environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing that encryption errors can be controlled through appropriate parameter selection while maintaining reasonable computation times. The work represents a significant step toward practical privacy-preserving reinforcement learning systems.

## Method Summary
The paper presents Encrypted RERL, which integrates relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning with fully homomorphic encryption. The method exploits RERL's structural properties - specifically its linear and min-free formulation - to enable efficient encrypted computation without requiring intermediate re-encryption operations. This is achieved by directly encrypting the policy evaluation and improvement steps while maintaining the mathematical properties needed for convergence. The framework handles error propagation from encryption (quantization and bootstrapping) through careful parameter selection and provides theoretical convergence guarantees despite these errors.

## Key Results
- RERL's linear and min-free structure enables encrypted computation without intermediate re-encryption
- Error analysis shows encryption-induced errors (quantization and bootstrapping) can be bounded and controlled
- Grid-World experiments validate the approach, demonstrating scalability with state space size and security parameters
- Increasing scaling factors reduces encryption errors while computation time scales predictably

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by exploiting the mathematical structure of relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. Unlike standard RL algorithms that involve complex min operations and non-linear transformations, RERL maintains a linear structure throughout policy evaluation and improvement. This linearity allows direct encryption of the computational steps without breaking the mathematical properties needed for convergence. The min-free formulation eliminates the need for secure comparison operations, which are typically expensive in FHE. By carefully managing the trade-off between encryption precision (scaling factor) and computational overhead, the framework achieves both privacy and practical performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**
- Why needed: Enables computation on encrypted data without decryption
- Quick check: Verify that ciphertext operations correspond to plaintext operations

**Relative-Entropy-Regularized RL (RERL)**
- Why needed: Provides linear structure amenable to encrypted computation
- Quick check: Confirm that policy updates maintain linearity and avoid min operations

**Error Propagation Analysis**
- Why needed: Quantify impact of encryption errors on policy convergence
- Quick check: Validate theoretical error bounds through numerical experiments

**Bootstrapping in FHE**
- Why needed: Refresh ciphertexts to manage noise growth during computation
- Quick check: Measure noise levels before and after bootstrapping operations

**Policy Iteration Convergence**
- Why needed: Establish theoretical guarantees for the encrypted algorithm
- Quick check: Monitor policy improvement steps for convergence behavior

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- Environment Model -> State Space Mapping -> Encrypted Policy Evaluation -> Encrypted Policy Improvement -> Policy Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path flows through the encrypted policy evaluation and improvement steps, where the linear structure of RERL enables direct homomorphic operations. The state space mapping transforms environmental states into encrypted representations, while the policy evaluation computes expected returns under the current policy. Policy improvement updates the policy based on the evaluation results, all performed under encryption.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The primary tradeoff involves balancing encryption precision (scaling factor) against computational overhead and error bounds. Higher scaling factors reduce quantization errors but increase computation time and ciphertext size. The framework must also balance security parameter selection against practical performance constraints.

**Failure Signatures**
- Convergence failure: Indicates insufficient encryption precision or inappropriate parameter selection
- Excessive computation time: Suggests scaling factors or security parameters need adjustment
- Policy quality degradation: May indicate error bounds are exceeded during computation

**3 First Experiments**
1. Validate basic policy evaluation under encryption on a simple Grid-World
2. Test policy improvement convergence with varying security parameters
3. Measure error propagation across multiple policy iteration steps
