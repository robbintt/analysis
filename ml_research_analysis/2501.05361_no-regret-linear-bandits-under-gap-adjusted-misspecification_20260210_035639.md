# No-Regret Linear Bandits under Gap-Adjusted Misspecification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.05361
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05361
- Reference count: 40
- Linear bandits can achieve O(√T) regret under gap-adjusted misspecification, compared to O(T/√log T) under uniform misspecification

## Executive Summary
This paper studies linear bandits under a new gap-adjusted misspecification framework where the approximation error at each point is proportional to its suboptimality gap. This contrasts with existing uniform misspecification approaches that result in linear regret. The authors show that the classical LinUCB algorithm is robust to such misspecification when the gap-adjusted parameter diminishes at O(1/(d√log T)), achieving near-optimal O(√T) regret. They further develop a phased elimination algorithm that achieves O(√T) regret with a constant gap-adjusted parameter ρ = O(1/√d) and requires only O(log T) batches of exploration.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a gap-adjusted misspecification framework where the approximation error is proportional to the suboptimality gap, contrasting with traditional uniform misspecification approaches. They prove that LinUCB is robust to this type of misspecification when the gap-adjusted parameter decays at O(1/(d√log T)), achieving O(√T) regret. The paper also develops a phased elimination algorithm that maintains O(√T) regret with a constant gap-adjusted parameter ρ = O(1/√d) while requiring only O(log T) exploration batches. The technical innovations include a self-bounding argument and an inductive lemma that limits misspecification error within the suboptimality gap for all valid actions in each batch.

## Key Results
- LinUCB achieves O(√T) regret under gap-adjusted misspecification when the gap-adjusted parameter diminishes at O(1/(d√log T))
- Phased elimination algorithm achieves O(√T) regret with constant gap-adjusted parameter ρ = O(1/√d)
- Phased elimination requires only O(log T) batches of exploration compared to continuous exploration in LinUCB
- Theoretical results show gap-adjusted misspecification is fundamentally more tractable than uniform misspecification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The gap-adjusted misspecification framework is more tractable than uniform misspecification because errors are naturally bounded by the suboptimality gap. When an action has small suboptimality gap, the model can tolerate larger approximation errors without significantly affecting regret. The self-bounding argument ensures that misspecification errors remain controlled throughout the algorithm's execution by exploiting this gap-dependent structure. The phased elimination algorithm leverages this by periodically refining the action set while maintaining sufficient exploration to bound the gap-adjusted parameter.

## Foundational Learning
**Linear bandit theory**: Understanding the relationship between suboptimality gaps and regret is crucial for analyzing bandit algorithms. Quick check: verify that actions with smaller gaps contribute more to regret than those with larger gaps.

**Self-bounding arguments**: These techniques show that certain error terms cannot grow too large without contradicting their own definition. Quick check: ensure that the misspecification error remains proportional to the gap throughout all algorithm iterations.

**Inductive lemmas in bandit analysis**: Used to propagate bounds across algorithm iterations by showing that if a property holds at one step, it holds at the next. Quick check: verify that the misspecification error stays within the suboptimality gap for all valid actions in each batch.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: LinUCB/Phased Elimination -> Confidence bounds estimation -> Action selection -> Regret calculation -> Misspecification error tracking

**Critical path**: The algorithm maintains confidence bounds around the parameter estimate, uses these to select actions, tracks the resulting regret, and monitors misspecification errors to ensure they remain proportional to suboptimality gaps.

**Design tradeoffs**: LinUCB uses continuous exploration for robust misspecification handling but may be less sample-efficient. Phased elimination trades off exploration efficiency (O(log T) batches) for potentially tighter regret bounds with constant gap-adjusted parameters.

**Failure signatures**: If misspecification errors grow faster than suboptimality gaps, regret bounds degrade. If confidence bounds are too conservative, exploration efficiency suffers. If phased elimination eliminates promising actions too aggressively, regret increases.

**First experiments**:
1. Compare LinUCB and phased elimination on synthetic linear bandit problems with varying gap-adjusted misspecification levels
2. Test algorithm robustness when the gap-adjusted parameter does not follow the assumed decay rate
3. Evaluate performance on real-world datasets with naturally occurring misspecification

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The gap-adjusted misspecification framework may not capture all practical scenarios of model misspecification
- The self-bounding argument relies on the assumption that misspecification error remains proportional to suboptimality gap throughout execution
- The framework assumes specific properties of the misspecified part that may be restrictive in practice

## Confidence
- High confidence in the O(√T) regret upper bound under gap-adjusted misspecification (proven mathematically)
- Medium confidence in the practical applicability of the gap-adjusted misspecification framework
- Medium confidence in the robustness of LinUCB to gap-adjusted misspecification based on theoretical analysis

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation on real-world datasets to test the robustness of the proposed algorithms under various forms of misspecification beyond the gap-adjusted framework
2. Analysis of the sensitivity of the results to different choices of the action set A_T and its evolution over time
3. Investigation of the algorithm's performance when the gap-adjusted parameter ρ does not follow the assumed O(1/(d√log T)) decay rate
