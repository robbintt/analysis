# DML-RAM: Deep Multimodal Learning Framework for Robotic Arm Manipulation using Pre-trained Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.03423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03423
- Reference count: 0
- Achieved MSE of 0.0021 and RMSE of 0.04604 on BridgeData V2 dataset with VGG16 + Random Forest configuration

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multimodal deep learning framework for robotic arm manipulation that combines visual and state-based information through a late-fusion strategy. The approach processes image sequences using pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet, Visual Transformer) and robot state data with machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Descent), then fuses their outputs to predict continuous action values for control. Evaluated on BridgeData V2 and Kuka datasets, the best configuration (VGG16 + Random Forest) achieved mean squared errors of 0.0021 and 0.0028, respectively, with corresponding RMSEs of 0.04604 and 0.05123. The framework demonstrates strong predictive performance, modularity, and interpretability, making it suitable for adaptive cyber-physical systems and human-in-the-loop applications.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of three components: (1) an image model using pre-trained VGG16/ResNet/ViT on past 3 images to predict future state image, (2) a state model using Random Forest or Gradient Descent on numerical state variables (joint effort, positions, velocities), and (3) a late-fusion module via CNN to predict action values. The method employs sliding windows of 3 consecutive images as input with the next image/state as target. Training-validation-testing splits are used across BridgeData V2 (60,096 trajectories) and Kuka datasets. The best configuration combines VGG16 visual features with Random Forest state predictions, achieving superior performance through modality-specific processing before fusion.

## Key Results
- Best configuration (VGG16 + Random Forest) achieved MSE of 0.0021 and RMSE of 0.04604 on BridgeData V2
- Same configuration achieved MSE of 0.0028 and RMSE of 0.05123 on Kuka dataset
- Random Forest consistently outperformed Gradient Descent for state processing (MSE 0.00256 vs 0.00547 on BridgeData)
- Visual Transformer achieved best standalone image model performance but underperformed in fusion context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Late-fusion of independently processed modalities yields lower prediction error than early fusion or single-modality approaches for continuous action prediction.
- **Mechanism:** Visual features extracted by pre-trained CNNs/ViT and robot state features processed by tree-based regressors are processed separately, then concatenated and passed through a fusion CNN. This preserves modality-specific feature quality before integration.
- **Core assumption:** Visual and state modalities provide complementary information that is better preserved through independent encoding than joint early-stage mixing.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "processes image sequences with pre-trained models and robot state data with machine learning algorithms, fusing their outputs to predict continuous action values"; [section III] "The outputs of these models are then fused to create a unified representation that is used to predict the action values"
- **Break condition:** If visual and state features are highly correlated or one modality dominates task performance, late fusion adds unnecessary complexity without accuracy gains.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Pre-trained vision models (VGG16, ResNet, ViT) transfer effectively to robotic manipulation feature extraction without domain-specific fine-tuning.
- **Mechanism:** Hierarchical spatial features learned from large-scale image classification serve as effective representations for robot perception, reducing data requirements for manipulation tasks.
- **Core assumption:** Visual features relevant to object classification also capture structure useful for action prediction in manipulation.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section III] "We experiment with different architectures for this task, including pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG16, and Vision Transformers"; [Table II, V] Visual Transformer achieved best standalone image model performance (MSE 0.0099 BridgeData, 0.0104 Kuka)
- **Break condition:** If manipulation requires fine-grained spatial reasoning not captured by classification-pretrained features, performance will degrade on novel object geometries.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Tree-based regression (Random Forest) outperforms gradient descent for processing robot state variables due to better handling of non-linear feature interactions.
- **Mechanism:** Random Forest's ensemble of decision trees captures discontinuous, non-linear relationships in joint effort, position, and velocity without requiring smooth optimization landscapes.
- **Core assumption:** Robot state-to-action mappings contain non-linear dependencies that tree-based methods model more effectively than linear gradient-based approaches.
- **Evidence anchors:** [Table III, VI] Random Forest consistently outperformed Gradient Descent (MSE 0.00256 vs 0.00547 on BridgeData; 0.00298 vs 0.00602 on Kuka); [section IV] "tree-based methods are better equipped to handle the complexities of state data in multimodal settings"
- **Break condition:** If state-action relationships are smooth and highly continuous, gradient-based methods with proper regularization may match or exceed Random Forest with better scalability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Late Fusion vs. Early Fusion in Multimodal Learning**
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is a late-fusion strategy; understanding when modalities should be combined is essential for architectural decisions.
  - Quick check question: Given two data streams (video + sensor readings), at what layer depth would concatenation preserve the most task-relevant information?

- **Concept: Pre-trained Model Transfer for Robotics**
  - Why needed here: Framework relies on VGG16/ResNet/ViT without robotic pre-training; understanding feature transfer is critical for model selection.
  - Quick check question: What visual features from ImageNet classification would plausibly transfer to predicting robotic grasping actions?

- **Concept: Regression Metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE) for Continuous Control**
  - Why needed here: Action prediction is evaluated via regression metrics; interpreting error magnitude relative to robot joint ranges is necessary for deployment decisions.
  - Quick check question: An RMSE of 0.05 on normalized joint effort—is this acceptable for safe manipulation, and how would you determine the threshold?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Model 1 (Image Branch): Input image sequence (3 frames) → Pre-trained backbone (VGG16/ResNet/ViT) → Feature vector → Model 2 (State Branch): Robot state vector (joint effort, position, velocity) → Random Forest Regressor → State prediction → Model 3 (Fusion): Concatenate [visual features, state prediction] → CNN layers → Continuous action values (7D: 6 joint efforts + 1 gripper)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Verify image preprocessing matches pre-trained model requirements (resize, normalize to ImageNet stats)
  2. Confirm state vector ordering and units match dataset documentation
  3. Validate fusion CNN input dimension equals sum of visual feature dim + state prediction dim
  4. Check action output scaling aligns with robot controller expectations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - VGG16 vs. ViT: VGG16 + Random Forest achieved best fusion results, but ViT performed best as standalone image model—choice depends on whether state branch quality dominates final performance
  - Random Forest vs. Gradient Descent: Random Forest consistently better but less scalable to very large state dimensions
  - Modular vs. end-to-end: Modularity enables interpretability and component swapping but may sacrifice joint optimization benefits

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High MSE in fusion model but low MSE in individual branches → Fusion CNN not learning effective integration; check concatenation dimension and fusion layer capacity
  - Large performance gap between BridgeData and Kuka → Dataset-specific overfitting; evaluate cross-dataset generalization
  - ViT outperforms VGG16 standalone but underperforms in fusion → Feature dimension mismatch or redundancy with state branch

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline replication:** Train VGG16 + Random Forest on BridgeData V2 subset (1,000 trajectories), confirm MSE approaches 0.0021 with proper train/val/test split.
  2. **Ablation study:** Compare late fusion vs. early fusion (concatenate raw images and states before any processing) to validate architectural choice.
  3. **Modality drop test:** Train image-only and state-only models, compare to fusion performance to quantify complementary contribution of each modality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the late-fusion strategy compare to early-fusion and hybrid fusion approaches for multimodal robotic manipulation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Fusion techniques, including early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion, each offer unique advantages depending on the application and data context."
- **Why unresolved:** Only late-fusion was evaluated; no comparative analysis across fusion strategies was conducted.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Head-to-head experiments comparing all three fusion strategies on BridgeData V2 and Kuka using equivalent model configurations and metrics.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can incorporating language as an additional modality improve task understanding and action prediction in this framework?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "Another key direction involves leveraging language as a modality to enhance task understanding and execution. Integrating large language models (LLMs) and multi-task learning frameworks could enable robots to generalize across tasks."
- **Why unresolved:** Only visual and state-based modalities were tested; language conditioning was not explored despite BridgeData V2 supporting natural language instructions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments adding LLM-derived language embeddings to the fusion model, evaluated on language-conditioned manipulation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the framework perform when deployed on physical robotic systems under real-time constraints?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] All experiments use offline datasets without real-world deployment, latency measurements, or actuation validation.
- **Why unresolved:** Dataset-only evaluation does not capture real-time inference requirements, sensor noise, or closed-loop control dynamics.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Physical robot experiments measuring inference latency, control loop frequency, and task success rates under real-world conditions.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How does this multimodal fusion approach compare to end-to-end deep learning and reinforcement learning baselines?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The abstract states the method differs from "conventional end-to-end or reinforcement learning methods," but no direct baseline comparisons are reported.
- **Why unresolved:** Without comparative baselines, the relative advantage of the late-fusion approach remains unquantified.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative evaluation including end-to-end neural network policies and RL methods (e.g., behavior cloning, QT-Opt) on identical data splits.

## Limitations

- Direct comparison with early-fusion and single-modality baselines is not provided, limiting validation of the late-fusion strategy's advantages
- No real-world deployment or latency measurements are included, despite the framework's claimed suitability for adaptive cyber-physical systems
- The framework's generalization to novel objects and tasks is not evaluated beyond the specific datasets used

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Performance metrics on BridgeData V2 and Kuka datasets (MSE and RMSE values are well-specified and reproducible)
- **Medium confidence**: Late-fusion strategy advantages (empirical but limited ablation studies)
- **Medium confidence**: Pre-trained model effectiveness (shown empirically but no comparison to domain-specific pretraining)
- **Medium confidence**: Random Forest superiority (consistent results but limited to tested datasets and state dimensions)

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Train the VGG16 + Random Forest fusion model on BridgeData V2 and evaluate on Kuka, and vice versa, to quantify domain transfer capabilities beyond reported in-domain performance.

2. **Fusion architecture ablation**: Compare late fusion against early fusion (concatenating raw images and states before any processing) and against modality-specific ablations (image-only, state-only) to isolate the contribution of each design choice.

3. **Scaling analysis**: Evaluate model performance as state dimension increases beyond the current 7 action outputs to test whether Random Forest maintains its advantage over gradient descent in higher-dimensional continuous control scenarios.
