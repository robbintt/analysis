# Structured yet Bounded Temporal Understanding in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685
- Authors: Damin Zhang; Julia Rayz
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: LLMs systematically adapt similarity judgments to temporal frames of reference, with sharp asymmetry for future events and strong negative similarity for distant events under sequential framing.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how large language models understand time by probing their similarity judgments under two temporal frames of reference: deictic (anchored to "now") and sequential (anchored to events). Using a dataset of real-world events from Wikidata and similarity judgment tasks, the authors find that LLMs show distinct patterns in how they relate reference points to target events, with temporal distance, interval relations, and event duration all playing key roles. Notably, similarity judgments are asymmetric under deictic t-FoR, with sharper decline for future events, and become strongly negative under sequential t-FoR when events are separated. The study also identifies greater instability in similarity judgments for overlap-based relations and duration effects that are confined to past events.

## Method Summary
The authors created a dataset of 45 reference points and 108 target events from Wikidata, representing diverse temporal distances, interval relations, and durations. They prompted two Qwen model variants (Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-30B) to rate the similarity of target events to reference points under both deictic and sequential temporal frames of reference. Similarity judgments were analyzed in relation to temporal distance, interval relations, and event duration. The analysis included comparison of mean similarities across categories, variance assessment, and temporal distribution profiling.

## Key Results
- Under deictic t-FoR, similarity judgments show asymmetric patterns with sharper decline for future events and higher variance in the past.
- Under sequential t-FoR, similarity becomes strongly negative once events are separated, demonstrating a shift in temporal understanding.
- Overlap-based interval relations exhibit higher variance and instability in similarity judgments, and duration influences similarity only for past events under deictic t-FoR.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None provided.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Frames of Reference (t-FoRs)**: Frameworks for interpreting temporal relations (e.g., deictic vs. sequential). Why needed: To understand how models encode time relative to events or the present. Quick check: Identify if a model's temporal reasoning shifts with context.
- **Interval Relations**: Topological relationships between time intervals (e.g., before, after, overlap). Why needed: These relations structure how models perceive similarity between events. Quick check: Map event pairs to interval relation categories.
- **Similarity Judgment Task**: Experimental method to probe conceptual understanding by asking models to rate similarity between temporal reference points and events. Why needed: Provides quantitative measure of temporal reasoning. Quick check: Ensure prompts are neutral and consistent.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input Prompt -> Qwen Model (Qwen3-4B/30B) -> Similarity Rating -> Analysis Pipeline (distance, interval, duration)
- **Critical Path**: Prompt generation and framing → Model inference → Similarity score collection → Statistical analysis of patterns
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Single model family (Qwen) for consistency vs. broader model comparison for generalizability; controlled experimental conditions vs. real-world complexity.
- **Failure Signatures**: High variance in overlap relations, asymmetry in future vs. past similarity, strong negative similarity under sequential t-FoR for distant events.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Replicate similarity judgment task using a different set of real-world events and multiple LLM architectures.
  2. Introduce a control condition with randomized or neutral temporal references.
  3. Conduct a follow-up study using alternative temporal reasoning tasks (e.g., event ordering, causal inference).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Do these temporal frame-dependent patterns generalize across languages with distinct spatiotemporal metaphors?
- Basis in paper: The authors state the work "currently focuses only on English text, leaving extension to other languages for future explorations."
- Why unresolved: The study is restricted to English, which encodes time differently than languages that conceptualize the future as "behind" or use absolute reference frames.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating the similarity judgement task using multilingual LLMs prompted in diverse languages (e.g., Aymara, Mandarin) to compare symmetry and variance patterns.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Are the observed instability in overlap-based relations and past-future asymmetry artifacts of the Qwen architecture or training data?
- Basis in paper: The experiment setup tests only two variations of the Qwen model (Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-30B).
- Why unresolved: It remains unclear if the specific high variance in overlap relations and the "richer" representation of the past are consistent across different model families (e.g., Llama, GPT) or unique to Qwen.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same benchmark and distance-interval analysis to a diverse set of open-source and proprietary models to observe if the patterns hold.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the resulting similarity structures to the choice of temporal frame of reference taxonomy?
- Basis in paper: The authors note "there is no common agreement of selecting which temporal frame of reference taxonomies to describe relations between events."
- Why unresolved: The study relies on Evans (2013), but it is untested whether the deictic/sequential dichotomy yields the same graded similarity results under alternative taxonomies (e.g., Moore’s ego-based vs. field-based).
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluating the dataset using different theoretical categorizations for reference points to see if the sharp decline in sequential similarity persists.

## Limitations
- The study relies on a single similarity judgment task, which may not capture all aspects of temporal reasoning.
- Results are based on only two variations of the Qwen model, limiting generalizability to other architectures.
- The absence of cross-validation with alternative datasets or tasks constrains the robustness of the observed patterns.

## Confidence
- High: Systematic patterns in similarity judgments and influence of temporal distance and interval relations.
- Medium: Robustness of patterns across t-FoRs and role of event duration.
- Low: Generalizability of results beyond the studied dataset and task.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the similarity judgment task using a different set of real-world events and multiple LLM architectures to test the robustness and generalizability of the observed patterns.
2. Introduce a control condition with randomized or neutral temporal references to quantify the specific contribution of deictic versus sequential t-FoRs to similarity judgments.
3. Conduct a follow-up study using alternative temporal reasoning tasks (e.g., event ordering, causal inference) to determine if the identified patterns hold across diverse measures of temporal understanding.
