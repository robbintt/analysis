# FedGES: A Federated Learning Approach for BN Structure Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.01538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01538
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: FedGES outperforms competing federated learning algorithms for BN structure learning in privacy-sensitive environments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FedGES, a federated learning approach for Bayesian Network structure learning that operates in privacy-sensitive, decentralized environments. The method addresses the challenge of learning BN structures without centralizing data by exchanging only evolving network structures rather than parameters or raw data. FedGES employs the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm and uses iterative structural fusion to combine limited models generated by each client, achieving superior performance compared to alternative federated learning algorithms and non-federated baselines.

The proposed approach demonstrates particular effectiveness in high-dimensional and sparse data scenarios, with execution times several orders of magnitude faster than competing federated approaches. Through controlled structural fusion mechanisms that enhance client consensus when adding edges, FedGES consistently achieves superior Structural Moralized Hamming Distance (SMHD) scores. The method shows that more restrictive fusion strategies perform better with increased client numbers and larger networks.

## Method Summary
FedGES is a federated learning framework for Bayesian Network structure learning that operates without centralizing data. The approach uses the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm locally on each client, where each client generates a limited number of network models. These models are then iteratively fused at a central server using controlled structural fusion mechanisms. The fusion process exchanges only evolving network structures rather than raw data or parameters, preserving privacy. The method includes a controlled structural fusion mechanism that enhances consensus among clients when adding edges to the network. Three fusion strategies (C50, C25, Union) are employed, with experimental results showing that more restrictive fusions perform better as client numbers and network sizes increase.

## Key Results
- FedGES consistently outperforms alternative federated learning algorithms (FedPC, RFcd) and non-federated baselines in BN structure learning
- Superior Structural Moralized Hamming Distance (SMHD) scores achieved across all tested scenarios
- Execution times several orders of magnitude faster than competing federated approaches
- More restrictive fusion strategies (C50, C25) show better performance with increased client numbers and larger networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedGES works by leveraging the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm locally on each client while maintaining privacy through structural-only exchanges. The controlled structural fusion mechanism ensures that only edges with sufficient consensus across clients are added to the final network, preventing overfitting and maintaining structural integrity. The iterative nature of the fusion process allows for gradual refinement of the network structure while preserving the privacy guarantees of federated learning. The method's effectiveness in high-dimensional and sparse data scenarios stems from its ability to combine local structural insights without requiring data centralization.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian Network Structure Learning: Learning the probabilistic relationships between variables in a directed acyclic graph format; needed for modeling complex dependencies in data; quick check: can be verified through graph theory properties
- Federated Learning: Distributed machine learning where clients train models locally and share only model updates; needed to preserve data privacy in sensitive domains; quick check: requires secure aggregation protocols
- Greedy Equivalence Search (GES): Score-based algorithm for BN structure learning that operates in forward and backward phases; needed for efficient local structure optimization; quick check: can be validated through score improvement metrics
- Structural Fusion: Combining BN structures from multiple sources while maintaining equivalence class properties; needed for consensus building across distributed clients; quick check: can be verified through graph isomorphism tests
- Structural Moralized Hamming Distance (SMHD): Metric for comparing BN structures that accounts for moralization; needed for evaluating structural similarity; quick check: can be computed through graph comparison algorithms
- Equivalence Classes: Sets of DAGs representing the same conditional independence relationships; needed for understanding BN structural equivalence; quick check: can be verified through d-separation tests

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Client -> Local GES Training -> Model Submission -> Server Fusion -> Consensus Check -> Updated Structure -> Broadcast to Clients

Critical Path: Each client runs GES locally → submits limited models → server performs controlled structural fusion → consensus check determines edge acceptance → updated structure distributed back to clients

Design Tradeoffs: Privacy preservation through structural-only exchanges versus potential loss of parameter information; local computation load versus communication efficiency; fusion strictness versus convergence speed

Failure Signatures: Poor convergence with highly heterogeneous data distributions; communication bottlenecks with large client numbers; structural inconsistencies when client data has conflicting dependencies

First Experiments:
1. Run FedGES on a simple 5-node BN with 3 clients to verify basic functionality
2. Compare SMHD scores between FedGES and non-federated GES baseline on medium-sized networks
3. Test different fusion strategies (C50, C25, Union) on a 10-node network with varying client counts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation focuses exclusively on synthetic and publicly available benchmark datasets, with limited validation on real-world privacy-sensitive applications
- Assumes synchronous communication between clients and a trusted server, which may not hold in practical deployment scenarios
- Does not systematically vary data sparsity or dimensionality to quantify advantages in high-dimensional and sparse data scenarios

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Experimental results and performance claims | Medium (limited to benchmark datasets) |
| Theoretical framework and algorithmic correctness | High (builds on established GES methodology) |
| Practical deployment considerations | Low (does not address asynchronous communication or Byzantine clients) |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FedGES on real-world privacy-sensitive datasets from healthcare or finance domains to assess practical utility
2. Test the algorithm under asynchronous communication and partial client availability scenarios
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on the structural fusion threshold parameter across varying network densities and client counts
