# Demo: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) for Patient Summarization in Molecular Tumor Boards

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06602
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06602
- Reference count: 26
- Introduces HAO, a multi-agent AI system achieving 94% coverage of high-importance information for patient summarization in Molecular Tumor Boards

## Executive Summary
The Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) addresses the labor-intensive and inconsistent preparation of patient summaries for Molecular Tumor Boards by introducing a multi-agent AI system that generates accurate, citation-backed summaries through specialized agents coordinated by an orchestrator. The system demonstrates strong performance in automating patient summarization, with the Patient History agent achieving 94% coverage of high-importance information and TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict criteria. This matches human-level summary quality while enabling traceable, scalable, and institution-controlled deployment without sharing sensitive clinical data.

## Method Summary
The study introduces the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a multi-agent AI system that generates accurate, citation-backed patient summaries for Molecular Tumor Boards. The system employs specialized agents coordinated by an orchestrator to automate the traditionally labor-intensive and inconsistent manual preparation of patient summaries. To evaluate the quality of these summaries, the authors propose TBFact, a claim-level evaluation framework that assesses completeness and succinctness by comparing clinical factual claims between generated and reference summaries. The evaluation was conducted on a de-identified dataset of tumor board cases, demonstrating the system's ability to match human-level summary quality while maintaining traceability and institutional data control.

## Key Results
- Patient History agent achieved 94% coverage of high-importance information (including partial entailments)
- TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict criteria
- Matches human-level summary quality while enabling traceable, scalable, and institution-controlled deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The HAO system works by orchestrating specialized AI agents that each handle specific aspects of patient summarization, from extracting clinical facts to organizing information coherently. The TBFact evaluation framework provides a rigorous, claim-level assessment that captures both completeness and succinctness of the generated summaries. By maintaining citation-backed outputs and operating within institutional data boundaries, the system addresses key challenges of accuracy, traceability, and data privacy in clinical settings.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-agent orchestration: Coordinating specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of complex tasks, needed for breaking down the summarization workflow into manageable components
- Claim-level evaluation: Assessing outputs by comparing specific factual claims against references, needed to capture both completeness and conciseness beyond traditional metrics
- Institutional data control: Deploying AI systems that operate within organizational boundaries, needed to maintain data privacy and regulatory compliance in healthcare settings

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Ingestion -> Agent Coordination Layer -> Specialized Agents (Patient History, Clinical Facts, etc.) -> Summary Generation -> TBFact Evaluation

Critical path: Data Ingestion → Agent Coordination → Patient History Agent → Summary Assembly → TBFact Validation

Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes accuracy and traceability over speed, using multiple specialized agents rather than a single monolithic model to ensure domain-specific expertise and citation-backed outputs.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation may occur when clinical data lacks standard formatting, when rare conditions fall outside agent training distributions, or when institutional data access policies restrict agent functionality.

First experiments:
1. Test individual agent performance on de-identified clinical cases before full orchestration
2. Validate TBFact framework against human reviewer consensus on sample summaries
3. Deploy pilot version in a single institution to assess integration with existing tumor board workflows

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a de-identified dataset without external validation across diverse clinical settings
- TBFact framework has not been independently validated against human reviewer agreement or alternative metrics
- Study does not address potential biases across different patient demographics or disease types

## Confidence
- High: Technical feasibility of HAO system and core performance metrics
- Medium: Generalizability of results across institutions and patient populations
- Low: Long-term sustainability and integration with existing clinical workflows

## Next Checks
1. External validation of TBFact framework against independent human reviewer consensus
2. Deployment pilot in multiple institutions with varying tumor board protocols
3. Systematic assessment of agent performance across diverse patient demographics and disease subtypes
