# Conformal Bandits: Bringing statistical validity and reward efficiency to the small-gap regime

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.09850
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09850
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Conformal Bandits integrate conformal prediction with bandit algorithms to achieve both statistical validity and logarithmic regret in small-gap regimes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Conformal Bandits, a novel framework that combines conformal prediction methods with multi-armed bandit algorithms to address the challenges of the small-gap regime where reward differences between arms are minimal. Traditional Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policies struggle in such settings, either incurring linear regret or failing to maintain adequate statistical coverage due to unstable confidence bounds. The proposed approach replaces Hoeffding-based confidence intervals with data-driven conformal prediction intervals, providing finite-sample statistical validity while improving exploration-exploitation efficiency.

Through comprehensive simulation studies and a practical portfolio allocation application, Conformal Bandits demonstrate superior regret performance compared to classical UCB methods while maintaining nominal coverage guarantees. The framework is further extended to handle regime-switching market dynamics through integration with hidden Markov models, showcasing its flexibility and robustness in complex, non-stationary environments.

## Method Summary
Conformal Bandits addresses the limitations of traditional UCB algorithms in small-gap regimes by replacing Hoeffding-based confidence intervals with data-driven conformal prediction intervals. The method leverages the finite-sample validity properties of conformal prediction to construct more stable and reliable confidence bounds, which in turn improves both statistical coverage and regret performance. The framework maintains computational efficiency while providing theoretical guarantees for both validity and reward efficiency, making it particularly suitable for applications where reward differences between arms are minimal and traditional approaches fail to perform adequately.

## Key Results
- Achieves logarithmic regret in small-gap environments where traditional UCB methods suffer from linear regret
- Maintains nominal statistical coverage guarantees through finite-sample validity of conformal prediction intervals
- Demonstrates superior performance in portfolio allocation applications, particularly when extended to handle regime-switching dynamics via hidden Markov models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Conformal Bandits works by addressing the fundamental instability of Hoeffding-based confidence bounds in small-gap regimes. When reward differences between arms are minimal, the traditional UCB approach requires excessive exploration to distinguish between arms, leading to high regret. Conformal prediction provides a more adaptive and data-driven approach to constructing confidence intervals, which better captures the true uncertainty in the estimates. This improved uncertainty quantification leads to more efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs, allowing the algorithm to identify the optimal arm faster while maintaining statistical validity.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal prediction**: Non-parametric uncertainty quantification method that provides finite-sample validity guarantees; needed to construct reliable confidence intervals without distributional assumptions; quick check: verify coverage holds at nominal level in simulations
- **Multi-armed bandit theory**: Framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty; needed to understand regret bounds and exploration-exploitation trade-offs; quick check: confirm logarithmic regret scaling
- **Small-gap regime analysis**: Study of bandit problems where optimal and suboptimal arms have nearly identical rewards; needed to identify limitations of traditional UCB methods; quick check: verify gap assumptions in experiments
- **Hidden Markov models**: Statistical models for regime-switching processes; needed to extend framework to non-stationary environments; quick check: confirm state estimation accuracy in simulations
- **Portfolio optimization**: Application domain for bandit algorithms in finance; needed to demonstrate practical relevance; quick check: validate out-of-sample performance
- **Statistical validity**: Guarantee that confidence intervals maintain correct coverage probability; needed to ensure reliable inference; quick check: perform coverage analysis across multiple runs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Conformal prediction module -> Bandit algorithm (UCB-style) -> Decision maker -> Environment/reward generator

**Critical Path:** The core innovation lies in replacing Hoeffding confidence bounds with conformal prediction intervals within the UCB framework. This modification occurs at the confidence bound calculation step, which then propagates through to the arm selection decision and ultimately affects regret accumulation and coverage guarantees.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades some computational overhead from conformal prediction calculations for improved statistical validity and regret performance. The small-gap assumption limits applicability but enables stronger theoretical guarantees. Integration with HMMs adds complexity but enables handling of non-stationary environments.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may manifest as degraded coverage when the small-gap assumption is violated, excessive computational overhead in high-dimensional settings, or instability in non-stationary environments without proper HMM integration. Watch for inflated regret when reward gaps are large or when conformal prediction intervals become overly conservative.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare coverage rates of conformal vs. Hoeffding confidence intervals in small-gap settings
2. Measure regret scaling as a function of time horizon and gap size
3. Validate HMM state estimation accuracy when integrated with conformal bandits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several important open questions, including the need for further theoretical analysis of conformal prediction intervals in sequential decision-making contexts, particularly regarding their behavior under adaptive sampling. The framework's performance in highly non-stationary environments and its robustness to violations of the small-gap assumption remain areas requiring additional investigation.

## Limitations
- Performance depends critically on the small-gap assumption, which may not hold in many practical applications
- Theoretical guarantees for conformal prediction in sequential decision-making contexts need further validation
- Simulation studies may not fully capture the complexity of real-world bandit problems with non-stationary environments

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Conformal prediction intervals provide finite-sample statistical validity (well-established property)
**Medium confidence:** Improved regret performance claims (demonstrated through simulations but needs broader validation)
**Medium confidence:** Maintaining robust coverage while achieving logarithmic regret in small-gap environments (supported by analysis but requires additional scrutiny)

## Next Checks

1. Extend empirical evaluation to diverse real-world bandit problems beyond portfolio allocation, such as recommendation systems or clinical trials, to assess generalizability
2. Conduct rigorous theoretical analysis of the interplay between conformal prediction intervals and bandit algorithms, focusing on the impact of adaptive sampling on coverage guarantees
3. Investigate robustness to violations of the small-gap assumption and explore potential extensions to handle non-stationary environments and heteroscedastic rewards
