# PlanGEN: A Multi-Agent Framework for Generating Planning and Reasoning Trajectories for Complex Problem Solving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16111
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16111
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art performance on NATURAL PLAN, OlympiadBench, GPQA, and DocFinQA with improvements up to 13% on GPQA

## Executive Summary
PlanGEN is a multi-agent framework designed to enhance natural language planning and reasoning through a combination of constraint extraction, iterative verification, and adaptive algorithm selection. The framework improves three popular inference-time algorithms—Best of N, Tree-of-Thought, and REBASE—by adding constraint-guided verification and selecting algorithms based on instance complexity using a modified UCB policy. Evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, PlanGEN demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results across various complex problem-solving tasks.

## Method Summary
PlanGEN operates as a modular multi-agent system that first extracts constraints from problem statements, then employs iterative verification to validate intermediate reasoning steps, and finally selects appropriate planning algorithms based on problem complexity using a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy. The framework integrates constraint-guided verification into existing inference-time algorithms, creating a more robust planning process that adapts to different problem types. The system is evaluated on four benchmark datasets—NATURAL PLAN, OlympiadBench, GPQA, and DocFinQA—demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested domains.

## Key Results
- ~8% improvement on NATURAL PLAN benchmark
- ~5% improvement on OlympiadBench (MATH subset)
- ~7% improvement on DocFinQA
- ~13% improvement on GPQA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PlanGEN's effectiveness stems from its multi-faceted approach to complex problem solving. By extracting constraints early in the process, the framework ensures that subsequent reasoning steps remain aligned with problem requirements. The iterative verification component catches and corrects errors before they propagate through the solution path, while the adaptive algorithm selection mechanism matches problem complexity with appropriate computational strategies. This combination addresses common failure modes in large language model planning, such as constraint violations and suboptimal algorithm choice, by introducing systematic verification and intelligent selection mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Constraint Extraction** - Why needed: Ensures all problem requirements are identified upfront; Quick check: Verify extracted constraints match problem statement semantics
2. **Iterative Verification** - Why needed: Catches reasoning errors before final answer generation; Quick check: Test with known error patterns to validate detection
3. **UCB Policy Modification** - Why needed: Balances exploration and exploitation in algorithm selection; Quick check: Monitor regret bounds during selection process
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Why needed: Enables specialized agents to handle different planning aspects; Quick check: Validate communication overhead doesn't outweigh benefits
5. **Inference-Time Algorithm Enhancement** - Why needed: Improves existing planning methods without full retraining; Quick check: Compare baseline vs enhanced algorithm performance
6. **Benchmark Evaluation** - Why needed: Demonstrates generalizability across problem domains; Quick check: Test on held-out data and real-world problems

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Problem Statement -> Constraint Extractor -> Algorithm Selector -> Planner (Best of N/ToT/REBASE) -> Iterative Verifier -> Final Answer

**Critical Path:** The most critical execution path runs from constraint extraction through iterative verification, as errors in early stages propagate through the entire solution process. The algorithm selector must make optimal choices quickly to avoid computational bottlenecks.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades increased computational complexity for improved accuracy and robustness. While simpler approaches might achieve similar results with less overhead, PlanGEN's modular design allows for component-specific optimization and easier maintenance.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include constraint extraction errors leading to constraint violations, suboptimal algorithm selection causing unnecessary computation, and verification loops that fail to converge on a solution. Performance degradation typically manifests as increased latency without corresponding accuracy gains.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test constraint extraction accuracy on diverse problem types to establish baseline performance
2. Validate iterative verification effectiveness by introducing controlled errors at different stages
3. Benchmark algorithm selection accuracy across varying problem complexities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on synthetic benchmark datasets without clear real-world applicability testing
