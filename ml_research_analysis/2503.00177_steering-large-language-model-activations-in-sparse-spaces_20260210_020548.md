core_contribution: This paper introduces sparse activation steering (SAS), a method
  that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to control LLM behavior at inference time by
  steering in sparse feature spaces. SAS vectors are generated by contrasting positive
  and negative completions for a desired behavior, extracting sparse representations,
  removing common features, and computing the difference between mean activation vectors.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces sparse activation steering (SAS), a method for controlling LLM behavior by manipulating sparse feature representations extracted via sparse autoencoders (SAEs). The approach generates steering vectors by contrasting positive and negative completions for desired behaviors, extracting sparse representations, removing common features, and computing differences between mean activation vectors. Experiments on Gemma 2 models demonstrate effective behavior modulation across seven behaviors including refusal, sycophancy, and factuality, with finer-grained control than dense methods. The method preserves performance on standard benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA while enabling simultaneous steering of multiple behaviors through feature compositionality.

## Method Summary
Sparse activation steering generates control vectors by contrasting positive and negative completions for target behaviors, extracting sparse representations using pre-trained SAEs, filtering features by activation frequency, and computing the difference between mean activation vectors. These SAS vectors are applied during inference by encoding activations at a target layer, adding the scaled vector, applying SAE nonlinearity, decoding, and adding a correction term. The method uses contrastive prompt pairs formatted as multiple-choice questions and evaluates steering effectiveness through probability shifts on held-out examples, GPT-4o judge scores for open-ended generation, and preservation of standard benchmark performance. Key hyperparameters include the frequency threshold τ for feature filtering and the scaling factor λ for vector application.

## Key Results
- SAS vectors effectively shift model behavior across seven target behaviors with consistent probability shifts (ΔP) on held-out examples
- Larger SAE dictionaries improve vector monosemanticity and interpretability, enabling more precise steering control
- Simultaneous steering of multiple behaviors is possible through feature compositionality without significant interference
- Steering does not degrade performance on standard benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA) when applied appropriately

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SAS works by leveraging sparse autoencoders to identify interpretable, monosemantic features in LLM activations that correspond to specific behaviors. By contrasting positive and negative completions, the method isolates features that are uniquely associated with the target behavior while removing common features that appear in both cases. The resulting sparse steering vectors can be applied at inference time to shift model behavior toward the desired outcome. The sparse representation space enables finer-grained control than dense methods because individual features correspond to more interpretable concepts, and the correction term ensures that the steering doesn't introduce reconstruction artifacts.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)**: Neural networks that learn to reconstruct inputs using sparse latent representations, enabling identification of interpretable features in LLM activations. Why needed: Provides the sparse feature space where steering vectors are computed. Quick check: Verify SAE reconstruction loss is below 5% on validation data.
- **Contrastive learning**: Technique that learns representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar examples. Why needed: Generates positive/negative completion pairs to isolate behavior-specific features. Quick check: Ensure contrastive pairs show clear behavioral differences in raw outputs.
- **Feature monosemanticity**: Property where individual features correspond to single, interpretable concepts rather than mixed meanings. Why needed: Enables precise steering by manipulating specific behavioral features. Quick check: Measure feature correlation matrix - diagonal dominance indicates monosemanticity.
- **Activation frequency thresholding**: Filtering features based on how often they activate above a threshold. Why needed: Removes noise and focuses on behaviorally relevant features. Quick check: Try τ ∈ {0.7, 0.8, 0.9} and observe steering effectiveness.
- **Behavior compositionality**: Ability to combine multiple steering vectors to achieve compound behavioral effects. Why needed: Enables simultaneous control of multiple behaviors. Quick check: Test paired steering vectors and measure feature overlap.
- **Inference-time steering**: Modifying model behavior during generation rather than through fine-tuning. Why needed: Enables flexible, on-demand behavior control without retraining. Quick check: Verify steering works on held-out examples not used for vector generation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Gemma-2 model -> SAE encoder -> Sparse representation space -> SAS vector application -> SAE decoder -> Output generation

**Critical path:** Input text → LLM encoding → Target layer activation → SAE encoding → Vector addition → SAE nonlinearity → Decoding → Output

**Design tradeoffs:** Sparse vs. dense steering (finer control vs. computational overhead), feature filtering threshold (noise reduction vs. information loss), steering layer selection (feature relevance vs. stability)

**Failure signatures:** High reconstruction loss (>5%), no steering effect despite correct implementation, performance degradation on standard benchmarks, feature interference when composing multiple vectors

**Three first experiments:**
1. Verify SAE reconstruction fidelity on sample activations from layer 12 of Gemma-2 2B
2. Generate SAS vector for single behavior (e.g., refusal) and test on held-out contrastive examples, measuring probability shift ΔP
3. Test feature compositionality by simultaneously steering two behaviors and measuring individual vs. combined effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on availability of high-quality pre-trained SAEs and properly formatted contrastive datasets that are not fully specified
- Generalization to other model architectures beyond Gemma-2 remains uncertain without extensive validation
- Simultaneous steering of multiple behaviors shows promise but lacks comprehensive quantitative validation across all behavior combinations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: SAS vector generation methodology is clearly specified and theoretically sound; quantitative comparisons support finer-grained control than dense methods
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about larger SAE dictionaries improving monosemanticity are based on internal analyses without detailed methodology description; benchmark preservation shown but effect sizes are small
- **Low confidence**: Claims about simultaneous steering without interference primarily supported by visualizations rather than comprehensive quantitative validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate SAS vector generation on a held-out dataset and verify consistent probability shifts (ΔP) across different random seeds
2. Implement systematic feature compositionality tests by pairing steering vectors for all seven behaviors, measuring individual and combined effects, and quantifying feature overlap
3. Conduct ablation studies on SAE hyperparameters (τ threshold, λ scaling, layer selection) to determine sensitivity and establish robust configuration guidelines
