# INFERENCEDYNAMICS: Efficient Routing Across LLMs through Structured Capability and Knowledge Profiling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16303
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16303
- Reference count: 31
- Achieved 74.55 average score across four challenging benchmarks, outperforming top single LLM by 1.28 points

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces InferenceDynamics, a multi-dimensional routing framework that addresses the challenge of efficiently navigating a diverse landscape of specialized Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework models capability and knowledge profiles of LLMs to intelligently match queries with the most suitable models. By extracting required capabilities and domain-specific knowledge from queries and quantifying LLM proficiencies, InferenceDynamics achieves superior performance compared to single-model approaches while optimizing resource utilization.

## Method Summary
InferenceDynamics employs a two-stage routing mechanism that first extracts required capabilities and domain-specific knowledge from queries, then quantifies LLM proficiencies across these dimensions. The framework creates structured capability and knowledge profiles for each LLM, enabling intelligent routing decisions based on weighted scores. This approach allows for optimal model selection that balances performance requirements with cost constraints, achieving competitive results at approximately half the budget of single-model approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved highest average score of 74.55 across four benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, BigGenBench, LiveBench)
- Outperformed top single LLM (Gemini-1.5-Pro) by 1.28 points
- Maintained competitive performance at approximately half the budget of the best single model
- Evaluated on RouteMix, a comprehensive dataset aggregating 24 diverse benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its structured approach to modeling both query requirements and LLM capabilities as multi-dimensional profiles. By decomposing queries into required capabilities and domain knowledge, and maintaining comprehensive proficiency profiles for each LLM, the system can make informed routing decisions that leverage the strengths of different models. This capability-based routing allows for optimal matching between query requirements and model specializations, resulting in improved overall performance compared to using single models.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Capability Profiling** - Systematic characterization of LLM strengths across different task types and domains; needed to enable intelligent routing decisions based on model specializations
2. **Knowledge Extraction** - Process of identifying required domain expertise from queries; critical for matching queries with appropriately specialized models
3. **Multi-dimensional Scoring** - Weighted evaluation of both capability and knowledge requirements; enables nuanced routing decisions that balance multiple performance factors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query -> Capability Extractor -> Knowledge Extractor -> LLM Profiler -> Router -> Selected Model

**Critical Path**: Query processing flows through capability and knowledge extraction, then through LLM profiling and routing decision to reach the final selected model.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances between comprehensive profiling accuracy and computational efficiency, opting for structured profiles that enable faster routing decisions while maintaining sufficient granularity for effective model selection.

**Failure Signatures**: Routing failures may occur when capability or knowledge profiles become outdated, when queries require capabilities not captured in the profiling system, or when the weighted scoring mechanism fails to properly balance competing requirements.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Benchmark routing performance using synthetic queries with known capability requirements
2. Evaluate profiling accuracy by comparing predicted vs. actual model performance on domain-specific tasks
3. Test cost-performance trade-offs under different budget constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation dataset composition and benchmark weighting remain unclear, potentially affecting generalizability claims
- Framework's adaptability to emerging domains and rapidly evolving LLM capabilities is not thoroughly addressed
- Operational efficiency metrics (latency, computational overhead) are not comprehensively characterized

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Routing framework architecture and benchmark performance improvements (74.55 vs 73.27)
- Medium Confidence: Cost efficiency claims based on budget comparisons
- Low Confidence: Long-term adaptability and scalability of profiling system

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive operational benchmarking including latency, memory usage, and computational overhead
2. Evaluate framework performance across additional domain-specific benchmarks beyond RouteMix
3. Track performance stability over time as new LLM versions are released and capabilities evolve
