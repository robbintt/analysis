core_contribution: This paper introduces two new ways to characterize and compare
  large language models based on their weight distributions. First, it constructs
  a standard-deviation vector from the normalized standard deviations of key weight
  matrices (Query, Key, Value, etc.), revealing distinct patterns between different
  model families and similarities within the same family.

- Introduces two novel methods for characterizing and comparing large language models based on their weight distributions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents two innovative approaches to analyze and compare large language models by examining their weight distributions. The first method constructs a standard-deviation vector from normalized standard deviations of key weight matrices, revealing distinct patterns between different model families. The second approach uses K-Means clustering on singular values from these matrices to create a clustering vector that similarly distinguishes models. The study also investigates how these vectors change after LoRA fine-tuning, finding that the standard-deviation vector is strongly influenced by the fine-tuning dataset while the clustering vector remains stable.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two characterization methods: a standard-deviation vector constructed from normalized standard deviations of weight matrices (Q, K, V, O, and MLP layers), and a clustering vector derived from K-Means clustering of singular values from these matrices. The authors apply these methods to analyze 7B parameter models from different families and examine their behavior after LoRA fine-tuning on a single dataset. The study focuses on the stability and dataset sensitivity of these vectors as a way to understand model relationships and fine-tuning effects.

## Key Results
- Standard-deviation vectors reveal distinct patterns between different model families while showing similarities within the same family
- Clustering vectors similarly distinguish models by family through K-Means clustering of singular values
- Standard-deviation vectors are strongly influenced by fine-tuning datasets, converging across models trained on the same data
- Clustering vectors remain stable after fine-tuning, preserving original model correlations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two proposed vectors capture different aspects of model weight distributions. The standard-deviation vector reflects the overall scale and spread of weights across different matrix types, which tends to be consistent within model families due to shared architectural designs. The clustering vector captures the internal correlation structure of singular values, which represents the intrinsic mathematical relationships within each matrix type. These complementary perspectives allow for both family-level discrimination and stability analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- Weight matrix normalization: Why needed - to compare across different matrix scales; Quick check - verify all values are in similar ranges before analysis
- Singular value decomposition: Why needed - to extract the most important features from weight matrices; Quick check - confirm first few singular values capture most variance
- K-Means clustering: Why needed - to group similar singular value patterns; Quick check - test clustering stability with different random seeds
- LoRA fine-tuning: Why needed - to study how weight distributions change with parameter-efficient adaptation; Quick check - verify that only adapter weights are modified

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Weight matrices (Q, K, V, O, MLP) -> Standard deviation calculation -> Vector construction -> Model family comparison
Critical path: SVD -> K-Means clustering -> Clustering vector generation -> Model relationship analysis
Design tradeoffs: Simpler statistical measures vs. complex clustering; single dataset fine-tuning vs. multiple datasets; 7B models only vs. scale generalization
Failure signatures: Inconsistent clustering results across seeds; singular values not capturing weight distribution; standard deviation vectors not distinguishing families
First experiments: 1) Replicate vector construction on held-out models; 2) Test clustering stability with different k values; 3) Apply methods to non-7B models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to Q, K, V, O, and MLP layers, potentially missing broader model characteristics
- K-Means clustering results depend on parameter choice (k) and initialization
- Study focuses only on 7B parameter models and a single fine-tuning dataset
- No statistical significance testing reported for observed patterns

## Confidence
High confidence in the methodology for constructing standard-deviation and clustering vectors
Medium confidence in the interpretation of family-level patterns due to small sample size
Low confidence in fine-tuning conclusions given single dataset and model family scope

## Next Checks
1. Test the methodology across multiple model families, scales, and architectures (including decoder-only and encoder-decoder models)
2. Perform statistical significance testing on the differences between standard-deviation vectors and clustering vectors across model families
3. Validate the fine-tuning observations with multiple datasets and training approaches to confirm the differential behavior of the two vectors
