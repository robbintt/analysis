# Olica: Efficient Structured Pruning of Large Language Models without Retraining

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08436
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08436
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Olica achieves state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning of LLMs without retraining, outperforming existing methods on WikiText2 and downstream tasks with significantly reduced data, GPU memory, and runtime requirements.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Olica, a structured pruning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that eliminates the need for retraining. The method leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compress the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layer by treating the matrix products WqWkT and WvWoK as unified entities. Additionally, a linear calibration strategy is introduced to mitigate error accumulation in the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer using low-rank matrices derived from the ridge regression solution. Experiments show that Olica achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks, such as WikiText2 and various downstream tasks, while requiring significantly less data, GPU memory, and runtime compared to existing methods. For example, on LLaMA-7B with 33% sparsity, Olica achieves a perplexity of 19.83 and an average accuracy of 61.21%, outperforming state-of-the-art pruning techniques.

## Method Summary
Olica employs a two-pronged approach to structured pruning of LLMs without retraining. For the MHA layer, it uses PCA to compress the attention mechanism by treating the matrix products WqWkT and WvWoK as unified entities, effectively reducing dimensionality while preserving essential attention patterns. For the FFN layer, Olica introduces a linear calibration strategy that constructs low-rank matrices from ridge regression solutions to mitigate error accumulation during pruning. This approach eliminates the need for computationally expensive retraining while maintaining model performance. The method is evaluated across multiple sparsity levels and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing pruning techniques on both language modeling and downstream tasks.

## Key Results
- On LLaMA-7B with 33% sparsity, Olica achieves perplexity of 19.83 and average accuracy of 61.21% on downstream tasks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques while requiring significantly less data, GPU memory, and runtime
- Demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmarks including WikiText2 and various downstream tasks
- Shows effective compression of both MHA and FFN layers without degradation in model quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Olica works by exploiting the inherent redundancy in LLM parameters through intelligent compression. The PCA-based approach to MHA compression captures the essential attention patterns by treating related matrix products as unified entities, reducing dimensionality while preserving critical information. The linear calibration strategy for FFN layers uses ridge regression solutions to construct low-rank matrices that compensate for pruning-induced errors. This two-stage approach addresses the different structural characteristics of attention and feed-forward components, allowing for effective compression without retraining. The method leverages the observation that many LLM parameters contribute redundant information, which can be eliminated while maintaining model functionality through these compression and calibration techniques.

## Foundational Learning

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Why needed: PCA identifies the most informative directions in high-dimensional data, enabling dimensionality reduction while preserving essential information
- Quick check: Verify that the first few principal components capture most of the variance in the attention weight matrices

**Structured Pruning**
- Why needed: Removes entire components (rows, columns, or filters) rather than individual weights, enabling computational efficiency on hardware
- Quick check: Confirm that pruning maintains model functionality while reducing FLOPs and memory requirements

**Ridge Regression**
- Why needed: Provides a stable solution for constructing low-rank matrices that mitigate error accumulation during pruning
- Quick check: Ensure the regularization parameter balances bias and variance appropriately for the calibration matrices

**Multi-Head Attention (MHA)**
- Why needed: Core component of transformer models that captures different aspects of input relationships through multiple attention heads
- Quick check: Validate that attention patterns remain coherent after PCA-based compression

**Feed-Forward Networks (FFN)**
- Why needed: Provide non-linear transformation capabilities in transformer architectures
- Quick check: Confirm that calibration matrices effectively compensate for pruning-induced errors in FFN layers

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input -> MHA Layer (with PCA compression) -> FFN Layer (with linear calibration) -> Output

**Critical Path**
The critical path involves the MHA layer's PCA compression followed by FFN layer calibration. PCA operates on the unified matrix products WqWkT and WvWoK, reducing dimensionality while preserving attention patterns. The compressed representations then flow through the FFN layer, where linear calibration matrices derived from ridge regression solutions compensate for pruning-induced errors. This sequential processing ensures that both attention and feed-forward components are effectively compressed without retraining.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The primary tradeoff involves balancing compression ratio against performance degradation. Higher sparsity levels yield greater computational efficiency but risk more significant accuracy loss. The PCA-based approach assumes that attention patterns can be effectively captured through dimensionality reduction, which may not hold for all tasks. The linear calibration strategy trades off the computational cost of retraining against the potential for residual errors. The unified treatment of WqWkT and WvWoK in MHA compression may oversimplify complex attention dynamics, potentially limiting generalizability.

**Failure Signatures**
Performance degradation manifests as increased perplexity on language modeling tasks and reduced accuracy on downstream evaluations. If PCA compression is too aggressive, attention patterns may become incoherent, leading to poor contextual understanding. Insufficient calibration in FFN layers results in error accumulation, causing unstable predictions. The method may fail when applied to architectures significantly different from the tested LLaMA-7B model, particularly those with non-standard attention mechanisms or layer configurations.

**First Experiments to Run**
1. Evaluate perplexity on WikiText2 at varying sparsity levels (10%, 33%, 50%) to establish the compression-performance tradeoff curve
2. Test downstream task performance on GLUE benchmark tasks to validate generalization beyond language modeling
3. Compare computational efficiency metrics (FLOPs, memory usage, runtime) against existing pruning methods at equivalent sparsity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical justification for treating WqWkT and WvWoK as unified entities in MHA compression is underexplored
- Linear calibration strategy's effectiveness across varying sparsity levels and model scales requires further validation
- Performance claims may not generalize to larger models (e.g., LLaMA-70B) or diverse application domains without additional testing
- Computational efficiency gains at extreme sparsity levels need detailed analysis for practical deployment considerations

## Confidence
- Performance claims: High
- Generalization across architectures: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Olica's performance on larger model variants (e.g., LLaMA-70B) and diverse task types to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of PCA-based MHA compression and linear calibration for FFN layers
3. Analyze the computational overhead and memory usage of Olica at extreme sparsity levels to determine practical deployment limits
