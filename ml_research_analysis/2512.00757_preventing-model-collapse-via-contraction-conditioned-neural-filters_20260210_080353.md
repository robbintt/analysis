# Preventing Model Collapse via Contraction-Conditioned Neural Filters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.00757
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00757
- Reference count: 18
- This paper addresses model collapse in recursive training of generative models by introducing a neural filter based on contraction operators.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses model collapse in recursive training of generative models by introducing a neural filter based on contraction operators. Unlike prior work requiring superlinear sample growth, the proposed method eliminates this dependence through a learned neural filter that enforces contraction conditions. The filter actively steers parameter estimates toward the true distribution, preventing divergence even with constant sample sizes. Theoretical analysis shows estimation errors converge probabilistically under mild assumptions. Experiments demonstrate the filter effectively prevents model collapse in exponential family distributions, with parameter estimates converging to true values regardless of sample growth rate. This work bridges theoretical stability conditions with practical neural network implementation, providing an end-to-end solution for sustainable model training.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a neural filter that learns to select data points enforcing contraction conditions during recursive parameter estimation. For exponential family distributions, the filter outputs selection weights for candidate samples, which are used to compute weighted sufficient statistics. These statistics update model parameters while the contraction loss ensures the parameter error dynamics satisfy Lyapunov stability conditions. The total loss combines classification accuracy with contraction enforcement, trained end-to-end. At deployment, the filter processes generated samples to maintain stable parameter estimates without requiring superlinear sample growth.

## Key Results
- Estimation errors converge probabilistically even with constant sample sizes, eliminating the need for superlinear growth.
- The neural filter effectively prevents model collapse in exponential family distributions (Gaussian distributions tested).
- Parameter estimates converge to true values regardless of sample growth rate (including t^½ and t² tested).

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Enforcing contraction conditions on parameter error dynamics causes estimation errors to converge in probability even with constant sample sizes.
- Mechanism: The error evolution is modeled as a stochastic difference system where a contraction operator causes the Lyapunov function to decrease in expectation, preventing random-walk divergence.
- Core assumption: Noise variance decays to zero as iterations increase.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states estimation errors converge probabilistically; Theorem 2.7 proves convergence under contraction, noise decay, and convex regulation assumptions.
- Break condition: If noise variance does not decay (e.g., adversarial corruption), contraction pull-back may be overwhelmed and divergence persists.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A neural filter trained with a combined classification-contraction loss can learn to select data points that implicitly implement the contraction operator.
- Mechanism: The MLP filter outputs selection weights for candidate samples, producing weighted sufficient statistics that yield parameter estimates. The contraction loss penalizes violations, steering filter parameters toward contraction-satisfying selections.
- Core assumption: Exponential family structure enables tractable sufficient statistics and invertible parameter estimation.
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.2 defines the combined loss; Sections 4.2-4.4 show experiments reducing estimation error vs. no-filter baseline.
- Break condition: If exponential family assumption is violated, the current architecture cannot compute parameter updates analytically.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Theoretical guarantees transfer from abstract contraction condition to practical neural implementation when contraction loss converges to zero during training.
- Mechanism: Minimizing the contraction loss enforces the inequality required by the theoretical assumptions, achieving zero contraction loss implies condition satisfaction.
- Core assumption: Gradient descent reaches a local minimum with negligible contraction loss.
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.4 monitors contraction loss convergence; Section 4.4 shows parameter distance decreases with filter.
- Break condition: If optimization gets stuck in local minima with positive contraction loss, theoretical guarantee does not apply.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lyapunov stability and contraction mappings
  - Why needed here: The entire theoretical framework depends on showing the Lyapunov function decreases in expectation.
  - Quick check question: Given V(e) = e^T P e and A^T P A ⪯ (1-c)P, explain why E[V(e_{t+1})] ≤ E[V(e_t)] - E[c · V(e_t)] + σ_t² implies eventual boundedness when σ_t² → 0.

- Concept: Exponential family distributions and sufficient statistics
  - Why needed here: The filter operates on sufficient statistics; parameter estimation uses the inverse gradient mapping, requiring exponential family structure.
  - Quick check question: For a multivariate Gaussian with unknown mean and known covariance I, identify T(x), Φ(θ), and show how θ_new is computed from weighted samples.

- Concept: Stochastic approximation and random walks in parameter space
  - Why needed here: Model collapse is framed as a random walk with drift; understanding step-size scaling motivates why superlinear growth was previously required.
  - Quick check question: Explain why fixed sample size n_t = n leads to divergent cumulative error in a pure random walk, and how a contraction term changes this behavior.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw data -> PCA features -> MLP with ReLU -> Sigmoid weights -> Weighted sufficient statistics -> Parameter update
- Critical path: 1) Label initial data to obtain reference parameters, 2) Train filter to minimize total loss until contraction loss ≈ 0, 3) At deployment, apply filter to select subset, estimate parameters, 4) Monitor parameter drift
- Design tradeoffs: λ (contraction weight) affects balance between contraction and classification; network capacity impacts ability to satisfy contraction; PCA dimension affects training speed vs. discriminative power
- Failure signatures: Contraction loss plateaus above zero; parameters diverge despite filter; filter outputs uniform weights
- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce Gaussian experiments comparing filter vs. no-filter under t^½ growth, 2) Ablate contraction loss (λ=0) to isolate its contribution, 3) Test sensitivity to reference parameter quality by corrupting θ_good

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the framework be adapted for fully unsupervised settings where a high-quality reference parameter θ_good is unavailable? The paper notes this dependency on ground truth labels may not always be accessible in real applications.
- Can the theoretical framework be extended to handle partial estimation? The authors list this as future work, noting current analysis assumes full parameter estimation.
- Is the method effective for high-dimensional generative models outside the exponential family? The methodology explicitly restricts to exponential families, potentially limiting applicability to complex models like LLMs.

## Limitations
- The method relies on the availability of high-quality reference parameters, which may not be accessible in fully unsupervised settings.
- The theoretical framework requires exponential family distributions, limiting applicability to non-exponential models.
- Hyperparameter sensitivity (particularly the contraction weight λ) could significantly impact filter effectiveness but was not thoroughly explored.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The Lyapunov stability analysis and contraction condition are mathematically sound and well-established in control theory.
- Medium confidence: The neural filter implementation can learn to satisfy contraction conditions in exponential family settings, as demonstrated experimentally.
- Low confidence: Theoretical guarantees reliably transfer to practical neural implementation, given the non-convex optimization landscape and potential for suboptimal local minima.

## Next Checks

1. Apply the filter to non-exponential family distributions (e.g., mixture models or heavy-tailed distributions) to identify breaking points in the sufficient statistic approach.
2. Systematically inject noise with varying decay rates into the recursive training process to determine the minimum noise variance decay required for contraction-based stability.
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the quality of θ_good (from perfect to significantly biased) to establish operational bounds for real-world deployment where true parameters are unknown.
