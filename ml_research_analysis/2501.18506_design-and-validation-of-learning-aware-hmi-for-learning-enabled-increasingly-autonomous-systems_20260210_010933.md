# Design and Validation of Learning Aware HMI For Learning-Enabled Increasingly Autonomous Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.18506
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18506
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Proposes LEIAS architecture combining symbolic logic with reinforcement learning for autonomous systems, validated in simulation for sensor anomaly management

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Learning-Enabled Increasingly Autonomous System (LEIAS) architecture designed to integrate learning-enabled algorithms into autonomous systems while maintaining safety and reliability. The system addresses the challenge of managing complex operational environments that require multi-sensor integration and adaptive autonomy. LEIAS combines symbolic decision logic with numeric decision preferences enhanced through reinforcement learning, providing a framework for transparent human-machine collaboration in increasingly autonomous systems.

The architecture was validated through simulation studies in Microsoft's XPlane environment, demonstrating improved performance in handling unreliable sensor data and enhancing human-machine collaboration. The system enables pilots to maintain control in standard scenarios while incrementally escalating autonomy based on necessity. Key features include multi-sensor assessment capabilities (GPS, IMU, LIDAR) and pilot preference learning that enables context-driven decision-making.

## Method Summary
The research employs the Soar cognitive architecture to merge human-machine collaboration with multi-sensor assessment. The LEIAS framework integrates symbolic decision logic with numeric decision preferences enhanced through reinforcement learning, creating a hybrid approach to autonomous system design. The system was implemented and tested in simulation environments using Microsoft's XPlane, focusing on sensor anomaly detection and management. The validation included pilot-in-the-loop scenarios to assess human-machine collaboration effectiveness and the system's ability to maintain safety while providing adaptive autonomy.

## Key Results
- Successfully demonstrated improved handling of unreliable sensor data through multi-sensor integration
- Enhanced human-machine collaboration while maintaining pilot control in standard operational scenarios
- Validated incremental autonomy escalation based on system necessity and environmental conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LEIAS architecture works by combining the interpretability of symbolic decision logic with the adaptive capabilities of reinforcement learning-based numeric preferences. This hybrid approach enables the system to maintain transparency in decision-making while adapting to complex, dynamic environments. The multi-sensor assessment framework allows for robust anomaly detection and sensor reliability evaluation, while the pilot preference learning mechanism enables context-aware autonomy that respects human operator intentions and expertise.

## Foundational Learning

- Reinforcement Learning: Why needed - Enables adaptive numeric decision preferences; Quick check - Validate reward function design and convergence
- Multi-Sensor Fusion: Why needed - Ensures robust operation despite individual sensor failures; Quick check - Test sensor reliability metrics and fusion algorithms
- Human-Machine Collaboration: Why needed - Maintains safety through human oversight; Quick check - Evaluate interface transparency and control transfer mechanisms
- Incremental Autonomy: Why needed - Provides graduated automation based on necessity; Quick check - Verify escalation thresholds and decision criteria
- Sensor Anomaly Detection: Why needed - Identifies unreliable sensor data; Quick check - Test detection accuracy across various failure modes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LEIAS Core -> Soar Architecture -> Multi-Sensor Assessment -> Pilot Interface -> Autonomy Escalation

Critical Path:
Sensor Data Collection → Multi-Sensor Assessment → Symbolic Decision Processing → Reinforcement Learning Update → Pilot Interface Display → Autonomy Decision

Design Tradeoffs:
The system balances transparency and adaptability by combining symbolic logic (ensuring interpretable decisions) with reinforcement learning (providing adaptive behavior). This tradeoff allows for human oversight while maintaining the ability to handle complex, dynamic environments.

Failure Signatures:
- Sensor anomalies trigger reliability assessment and potential autonomy escalation
- Pilot override signals maintain human control despite system recommendations
- Learning convergence issues may require retraining or parameter adjustment
- Multi-sensor fusion failures could lead to degraded system performance

First Experiments:
1. Test sensor anomaly detection with controlled sensor degradation in simulation
2. Validate human-machine collaboration through pilot-in-the-loop scenarios with varying autonomy levels
3. Evaluate multi-sensor fusion performance under different environmental conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, focusing instead on presenting the LEIAS architecture and initial validation results.

## Limitations
- Validation limited to simulation environments without real-world flight testing
- Lack of detailed performance metrics comparing LEIAS to traditional autonomy approaches
- Incomplete evaluation of pilot preference learning effectiveness in operational scenarios
- Undefined thresholds and criteria for autonomy escalation mechanisms

## Confidence
- High confidence in the conceptual framework and architectural design of LEIAS
- Medium confidence in the sensor integration methodology and multi-sensor assessment approach
- Low confidence in the effectiveness of pilot preference learning and autonomy escalation mechanisms without real-world validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field testing with actual aircraft to validate system performance under real flight conditions and sensor noise
2. Implement comparative studies between LEIAS and traditional autonomy systems in controlled flight scenarios
3. Perform extensive user studies with pilots to evaluate the interpretability of system state views and effectiveness of human-machine collaboration features
