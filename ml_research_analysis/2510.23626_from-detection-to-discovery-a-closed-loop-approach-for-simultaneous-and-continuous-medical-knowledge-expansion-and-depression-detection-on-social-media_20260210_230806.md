# From Detection to Discovery: A Closed-Loop Approach for Simultaneous and Continuous Medical Knowledge Expansion and Depression Detection on Social Media

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.23626
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23626
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Closed-loop LLM-knowledge graph framework improves F1 score from 0.816 to 0.825 while discovering novel depression-related medical insights from social media data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a closed-loop framework that simultaneously performs depression detection and medical knowledge expansion using social media data. The approach integrates LLM-based entity extraction and depression risk prediction with knowledge graph refinement, creating an iterative cycle where detection informs discovery and vice versa. Experiments on Reddit data demonstrate improved detection accuracy (F1: 0.816→0.825) across nine time periods while validating clinically meaningful discoveries of novel symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers through expert review.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a closed-loop architecture where an LLM jointly extracts depression-related entities and predicts depression risk from user-generated content. These predictions feed into a knowledge graph that quantifies entity importance, refines existing medical knowledge, and incorporates validated new insights. The system operates iteratively, with each cycle using updated knowledge to improve subsequent detection performance. The approach was validated on large-scale Reddit data, comparing against strong baselines including fine-tuned LLMs and deep learning models, with expert validation confirming the clinical relevance of discovered medical insights.

## Key Results
- F1 score improved from 0.816 to 0.825 across nine time periods compared to baseline models
- Framework outperformed strong baselines including fine-tuned LLMs and deep learning models
- Expert validation confirmed clinically meaningful discoveries of novel depression symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its closed-loop design that creates synergistic feedback between detection and knowledge discovery. By integrating LLM-based entity extraction with knowledge graph refinement, the system continuously updates its understanding of depression-related patterns while improving predictive accuracy. The iterative nature allows the framework to adapt to emerging trends in social media discourse, capturing evolving manifestations of depression that static models might miss.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge graph integration** - why needed: Enables structured representation of complex medical relationships; quick check: Verify entity connections follow clinical hierarchies
- **Iterative refinement** - why needed: Allows continuous adaptation to new data patterns; quick check: Monitor performance stability across cycles
- **Dual-task learning** - why needed: Simultaneously extracts entities and predicts risk for efficiency; quick check: Ensure both tasks maintain accuracy independently
- **Expert validation** - why needed: Confirms clinical relevance of discovered insights; quick check: Document validation criteria and reviewer expertise
- **Temporal analysis** - why needed: Captures evolving patterns in social media discourse; quick check: Validate consistency across multiple time periods
- **Closed-loop feedback** - why needed: Creates synergy between detection and discovery; quick check: Measure improvement correlation between tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** LLM extraction -> Depression prediction -> Knowledge graph update -> Entity importance scoring -> Framework refinement

**Critical path:** User posts → LLM entity extraction → Depression risk prediction → Knowledge graph validation → Updated knowledge incorporation → Next detection cycle

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes accuracy and discovery over computational efficiency, requiring iterative processing that may limit real-time deployment. The closed-loop approach increases complexity but enables continuous learning, while expert validation adds credibility at the cost of scalability.

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation may occur if initial knowledge graph is incomplete or biased, if social media data quality varies significantly, or if expert validation becomes bottlenecked. The framework may also struggle with rare depression presentations or platform-specific linguistic patterns not captured in training data.

**3 first experiments:** (1) Test framework performance on a single time period with known outcomes; (2) Compare knowledge graph refinement speed vs. detection accuracy trade-offs; (3) Validate expert discovery confirmation process on a small subset of entities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond Reddit data remains unproven without cross-platform validation
- Performance improvement of 0.009 F1 score may have limited practical clinical impact
- Computational complexity raises scalability concerns for real-time deployment
