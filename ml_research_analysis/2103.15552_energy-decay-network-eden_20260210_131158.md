core_contribution: This paper introduces the Energy Decay Network (EDeN) framework
  as an alternative to narrow AI systems, proposing a biologically-inspired neural
  network model that uses energy-based local regulation instead of global loss functions.
  The framework employs a genetic transfer of experience through a common regulation/exchange
  value (energy) to create co-dependent neural architecture and unit processes developed
  by genetic and real-time signal processing influences.

- Primary result: Introduces energy-based local regulation neural network framework replacing global loss functions

## Executive Summary
The Energy Decay Network (EDeN) presents a biologically-inspired neural network framework that replaces traditional backpropagation with local energy-based regulation. The system uses process nodes that compete for survival based on stability metrics rather than minimizing global loss functions. Each node maintains energy through local computations and adjusts its morphology based on genetic encoding (Functome) and real-time signal processing. The framework aims to create adaptable networks capable of transfer learning across different domains through energy-driven local optimization.

## Method Summary
EDeN implements a three-dimensional neural grid where process nodes communicate through energy accumulation and local regulation. Each node contains a Current Energy Model (CEM) with Propagation, Weight, and Router tensors that manage signal transmission. Nodes spike when accumulated energy exceeds a minimum threshold, releasing TransArch payloads that influence both immediate signal propagation and long-term morphological development. Stability is measured via KL divergence of spike distributions across epochs, with nodes being pruned if they fail to maintain stable patterns. The Functome encodes genetic actions for morphological changes, enabling transfer learning through inherited structural biases.

## Key Results
- Proposes local energy-based regulation as alternative to global loss functions
- Introduces Stability Index (PNSI) calculated via KL divergence for node evaluation
- Implements genetic transfer of experience through common regulation/exchange value (energy)
- Uses three-dimensional neural grid with dynamic growth and pruning based on stability metrics
- Incorporates specialized components like Transmitters, Architectors, and Growth Cones for neurotransmitter-like behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Energy-Based Local Regulation Replaces Global Loss
The framework substitutes global backpropagation with local energy management where each process node accumulates energy through dendrite inputs via PWR tensors. When internal energy exceeds a minimum threshold, the node spikes and releases TransArch payloads. Nodes self-regulate through a Stability Index derived from KL divergence of spike distributions across epochs. This local pressure for energy efficiency and stable firing patterns aggregates into network-wide competence without top-down error signals.

### Mechanism 2: Stability-Driven Dynamic Morphology
Network architecture emerges from stability metrics rather than manual design. Process nodes track spike distributions across epochs, computing KL divergence between current and prior distributions to yield the Process Node Stability Index (PNSI). High PNSI enables continued growth while low PNSI triggers pruning. Growth cones adjust dendrite targeting toward largest stimulation sources, while axons follow Functome-encoded biases modified by Architector signals.

### Mechanism 3: Functome-Encoded Transferable Structure
Morphological biases encoded in a "Functome" enable intergenerational transfer and cross-domain adaptation. The Functome stores available actions with prerequisites that express as morphology during development phases. Successful configurations leave traces in the Functome for re-expression, while training sessions log morphological hashes for traceability. This approach encodes useful structural adaptations as action/prerequisite rules rather than full weight matrices.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Temporal Coding**
  - Why needed here: EDeN uses spike frequency and z-axis spike position as information carriers instead of continuous activations. Understanding TTFS and rate coding is essential for interpreting the CEM's propagation logic.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how spike timing encodes information differently from activation values in standard CNNs?

- **Concept: KL Divergence and Self-Information**
  - Why needed here: The Stability Index (PNSI) is computed via KL divergence between consecutive spike distributions. Self-information theory underpins the entire stability metric.
  - Quick check question: Given two discrete distributions P and Q, what does KL(P||Q) measure, and what does a low value indicate?

- **Concept: Genetic Algorithms with Encoded Expression Rules**
  - Why needed here: Unlike standard GAs that mutate parameters directly, EDeN's Functome mutates action availability and prerequisites that then express as morphology. This resembles gene regulatory networks more than weight-space optimization.
  - Quick check question: How does mutating "action availability" differ from mutating weights directly in terms of search space and transferability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Neural Grid (3D) -> Process Nodes (sparse spatial container)
  - Process Node -> CEM (Current Energy Model) + dendrites + axon terminals + growth cones + Functome reference
  - CEM -> PWR tensors (Propagation × Weight × Router) of dimensions X×Y×Z
  - TransArch Payloads -> Transmitters (short-term signal) + Architectors (long-term morphology influence)
  - Functome -> Per-node genetic encoding of available actions + prerequisites
  - Input Probes -> Vector update fields (no backprop)
  - Output Probes -> Vector readers for external systems

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize: Create Neural Grid; seed Process Nodes with randomized Functome actions and positions
  2. Propagate: Input probes inject energy; CEM tensors propagate; nodes spike when PnE ≥ MinE; release TransArch payloads
  3. Evaluate: Compute PNSI via KL divergence on spike distributions
  4. Prune: Remove nodes below stability threshold
  5. Develop: Execute Functome actions; adjust growth cones; apply mutations if PNSI low
  6. Repeat until stability converges → lock Functome for deployment

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Local vs. global optimization: Eliminates global loss but may converge slower or to different optima than backprop
  - 3D grid overhead: Sparse 3D representation enables spatial routing but increases memory vs. dense layer matrices
  - Functome search space: Action/prerequisite encoding is compact but requires more epochs to discover useful morphologies compared to gradient descent
  - Single-input transfer function: Each CEM step receives one router-selected input (biologically plausible but less expressive than fully-connected layers)

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Cascading apoptosis: Initial Functome produces unstable nodes, network collapses to empty grid
  - Stuck in discrimination state: Node never achieves generation, indicating overfitting to noise
  - No spike activity: MinE threshold too high or input energy too weak, network appears "dead"
  - Excessive growth unchecked: Stability thresholds too permissive, grid saturates with redundant nodes

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Spike threshold calibration: Run single Process Node in isolation; sweep MinE and decay rate; verify stable spike distributions emerge for repeating input patterns
  2. Minimal loop test: Create 2-node network (input → node A → node B → output probe); verify stability propagates and Functome actions produce at least one axon/dendrite adjustment per 100 epochs
  3. Domain transfer probe: Train entity on simple periodic signal; lock Functome; expose to different amplitude/frequency variant; measure PNSI recovery time vs. fresh entity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can EDeN entities achieve competitive performance on complex, real-world benchmark tasks compared to conventional deep learning architectures?
- Basis in paper: Large scale testing for trained entities performing complex tasks has yet to be achieved

- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics on standard benchmarks comparing EDeN to CNNs/MLPs with equivalent computational budgets

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the stability index (PNSI) reliably correlate with task-relevant performance, or does local stability optimization diverge from global objectives?
- Basis in paper: Framework replaces global loss with local stability optimization, but relationship between minimizing KL divergence and producing useful task behavior is unproven
- Why unresolved: No experiments show relationship between PNSI improvement and downstream task success
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between PNSI trajectories and task performance metrics across training epochs
