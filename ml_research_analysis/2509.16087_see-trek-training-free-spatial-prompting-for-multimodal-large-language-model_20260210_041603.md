# See&Trek: Training-Free Spatial Prompting for Multimodal Large Language Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.16087
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16087
- Authors: Pengteng Li; Pinhao Song; Wuyang Li; Weiyu Guo; Huizai Yao; Yijie Xu; Dugang Liu; Hui Xiong
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: First training-free framework that enhances MLLM spatial reasoning using only vision, achieving up to 3.5% improvement on VSI-BENCH and STI-BENCH.

## Executive Summary
SEE&TREK introduces a novel training-free prompting framework that enhances spatial understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using only visual inputs. The method addresses two key limitations in existing MLLMs: visual homogeneity from uniform frame sampling and lack of motion information in selected keyframes. By employing Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling with an off-the-shelf object detector and Motion Reconstruction using Visual Odometry, SEE&TREK extracts semantically diverse keyframes and simulates camera trajectories to encode spatial-temporal context. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across diverse spatial reasoning tasks without requiring training or GPU acceleration.

## Method Summary
SEE&TREK operates as a pre-processing pipeline that transforms video input into a multimodal prompt for MLLMs. The framework samples frames at regular intervals, then uses YOLOv8n to detect objects and select 8 semantically diverse keyframes through a "Balanced-TopK" strategy that maximizes object class diversity while minimizing overlap. Simultaneously, it runs Visual Odometry (ORB features + Essential Matrix) to recover relative camera poses and renders trajectory plots (BEV and 3D). These trajectories are color-coded and overlaid onto keyframes as spatiotemporal markers. The final prompt combines 8 encoded keyframes, 2 trajectory visualizations, and a text description, all fed to the MLLM in a single forward pass.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 3.5% improvement in average accuracy on VSI-BENCH and STI-BENCH spatial reasoning benchmarks
- Outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods while requiring only a single forward pass
- Maintains GPU-free operation by using YOLOv8n (Nano) and CPU-based Visual Odometry
- Demonstrates consistent gains across multiple MLLM architectures including InternVL3-8B

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Diversity Injection via Keyframe Selection
Replaces uniform temporal sampling with detector-driven selection to reduce visual homogeneity and improve signal-to-noise ratio. Uses "Balanced-TopK" strategy with YOLO to select frames maximizing unique object class diversity across temporal segments.

### Mechanism 2: Implicit Depth/Motion Grounding via Visual Odometry
Provides explicit camera trajectory visualizations (BEV and 3D) derived from monocular video, allowing MLLMs to overcome unknown motion limitations inherent in static frame analysis.

### Mechanism 3: Spatiotemporal Binding via Visual Overlay
Overlays trajectory-specific color gradients and numerical indices directly onto keyframes, creating a soft inductive prior that links semantic content with temporal progression.

## Foundational Learning

- **Visual Odometry (VO)**: Core "Motion Reconstruction" module relies on monocular VO (ORB-SLAM) to estimate camera pose. Understanding feature matching and Essential Matrix is required to debug trajectory errors.
  - *Quick check*: Why does monocular VO typically recover translation only "up to scale," and how might this relative scale affect the MLLM's size estimation reasoning?

- **Object Detection (YOLO)**: "Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling" depends entirely on YOLO detector's recall and precision. If YOLO misses small objects, those frames are discarded, potentially losing spatial context.
  - *Quick check*: Does the framework use the detector's bounding box coordinates for spatial reasoning, or just the class labels for selection?

- **Spatial-Temporal Reasoning in Transformers**: Method feeds sequence of images and plot to standard MLLM. Understanding how attention mechanisms handle interleaved visual modalities is required to optimize the prompt.
  - *Quick check*: How does "Balanced-TopK" selection ensure context window isn't flooded with redundant information compared to uniform sampling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video -> Frame Sub-sampler (N=4) -> VO Module (ORB + Essential Matrix) -> Trajectory Plot (BEV+3D) -> Perception Module (YOLOv8n) -> Class Set -> Balanced-TopK Selector -> Spatiotemporal Encoding -> Prompt Assembler -> MLLM

- **Critical path**: The Balanced-TopK selection (Algorithm 2). If this logic selects frames with high object overlap, MLLM receives redundant visual data, negating "Visual Diversity" benefit.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - YOLOv8n (Nano) vs Accuracy: Chooses Nano for "GPU-free" speed, acknowledging larger models offer slightly better accuracy but are orders of magnitude slower (Tradeoff: Speed vs Frame Recall)
  - Interval N: Recommends N=4; lower N increases computation time 4x for marginal accuracy gains (Tradeoff: Granularity vs Latency)

- **Failure signatures**:
  - "Hallucinated Motion": VO fails on low-texture walls, trajectory plot is noise, MLLM may hallucinate non-existent path
  - "Semantic Blindness": YOLO fails to detect object relevant to question, Balanced-TopK discards frame containing it, making question unanswerable

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Unit Test VO: Feed 3 videos (high motion, low texture, static) into VO module. Verify trajectory plot matches camera movement without drift
  2. Selection Ablation: Compare "Balanced-TopK" vs "Uniform" vs "Top-K (object count only)" on 5 random VSI-Bench samples. Measure "Object Count" accuracy manually
  3. End-to-End Zero-Shot: Run full pipeline with only trajectory plot vs only keyframes to isolate "Motion Reconstruction" contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can replacing the lightweight YOLOv8n detector with dense perception models (e.g., GroundingDINO or DepthAnything) overcome the semantic limitations observed in multi-class scenes?
- *Basis*: Authors state in Appendix D that performance is limited by external perception model and future work will "explore the use of visual perception models with richer semantic knowledge... e.g. DEPTHANYTHING or GROUNDINGDINO."
- *Why unresolved*: Current framework relies on lightweight detector (YOLOv8n) for "GPU-free" efficiency, which struggles with generalization in complex scenes, but trade-off between heavier models and efficiency untested.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does the visual trajectory input allow MLLMs to construct coherent implicit spatial maps compared to standard frame sequences?
- *Basis*: Appendix C notes that while outputs improve, "influence of motion reconstruction on model's internal inference processes remains less understood," specifically regarding how trajectories aid in structuring "implicit spatial maps."
- *Why unresolved*: Paper demonstrates external performance gains but provides limited mechanistic evidence on how trajectory visualization alters internal reasoning state or memory of MLLM.

### Open Question 3
How robust is Motion Reconstruction module when feature matching fails due to low texture or aggressive rotation?
- *Basis*: Method relies on ORB feature matching and essential matrix estimation (Visual Odometry), which are notoriously brittle in texture-less environments or during rapid movements, yet paper doesn't analyze failure cases specific to these tracking losses.
- *Why unresolved*: Experiments conducted on datasets (ScanNet, ARKitScenes) which generally have sufficient texture; pipeline's degradation when VO inputs are noisy or broken remains unquantified.

### Open Question 4
Does inherent scale ambiguity of monocular Visual Odometry limit performance on absolute metric estimation tasks (e.g., Room Size, Absolute Distance)?
- *Basis*: Method estimates relative poses "up to scale" (Section 3.2), yet framework is evaluated on tasks requiring absolute metric outputs without explicit depth sensors, suggesting potential mismatch between relative trajectory cues and absolute ground truth.
- *Why unresolved*: Unclear if MLLM relies on visual heuristics from keyframes for scale rather than trajectory, or if trajectory creates confusion regarding absolute distances.

## Limitations

- Performance heavily dependent on quality of external perception model (YOLO), which may fail in scenes with small objects or unusual classes
- Monocular Visual Odometry susceptible to drift and failure in low-texture environments, potentially generating noisy trajectory visualizations
- Assumes MLLMs can interpret abstract trajectory plots and color-coded markers without explicit training, which may not generalize across architectures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core contribution of training-free spatial prompting through semantic diversity injection and motion reconstruction is well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Specific mechanisms of how MLLMs interpret trajectory plots are plausible but not fully validated
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to videos with significantly different characteristics remains untested

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Test See&Trek with multiple MLLM architectures (GPT-4o, Claude-3) to verify trajectory interpretation capability is not model-specific

2. **Failure Case Analysis**: Systematically evaluate framework on videos with known challenging conditions (low texture, heavy motion blur, small objects) to identify failure modes and quantify performance degradation

3. **Ablation on Trajectory Scaling**: Experiment with different scaling factors for monocular VO output to determine whether MLLM's spatial reasoning is affected by absolute scale of trajectory visualization
