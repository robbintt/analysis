## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching (IBEaM), a method that improves LLM performance on classification and ranking tasks by extracting the model's inductive biases and incorporating them into prompts. IBEaM works by prompting the LLM to generate Likert scales for component metrics (e.g., progress, feasibility), then using those calibrated scales in subsequent evaluations to match the LLM's internal preferences. The approach is applied to three tasks: WikiHow step ranking, summary applicability classification, and action condition classification. Results show IBEaM improves LLM Likert-based classification accuracy by up to 19% and ranking performance by up to 27% compared to baseline prompts. Ablation studies confirm both the self-calibration and metric-splitting components are essential for consistent gains.

## Method Summary
IBEaM is a four-step pipeline: (1) define component metrics that decompose the task (e.g., progress and feasibility), (2) create a prompt template for scale generation, (3) prompt the LLM to generate 10-point Likert scales per metric with textual descriptions for each level, and (4) aggregate scores using task-specific methods (product of ranks for ranking, logistic regression for classification). The method relies on the premise that LLMs have consistent linguistic preferences for how abstract concepts should be operationalized, and these preferences can be extracted through self-calibration. Each trial uses freshly generated scales, with results averaged across 5 trials to measure variance.

## Key Results
- IBEaM improves LLM Likert-based classification accuracy by up to 19% compared to baseline prompts
- Ranking performance improves by up to 27% with IBEaM on WikiHow step selection tasks
- Ablation studies show both self-calibration and metric splitting are essential, with performance dropping below baseline when either component is removed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Self-Calibration Through Scale Generation
LLM-generated Likert scales improve downstream scoring because they encode the model's own linguistic preferences (inductive biases) into a reusable evaluation rubric. The LLM is first prompted to generate a 10-point scale with descriptions for each rating level. This scale is then included in the conversation history when evaluating instances. The self-generated wording matches the model's internal representations more closely than human-authored scales. The core assumption is that LLMs have consistent preferences for how abstract concepts (e.g., "feasibility") should be linguistically operationalized, and these preferences persist across a session. Evidence shows removing self-calibration drops average F1 below baseline (65.5 vs 66.1), demonstrating calibration is necessary for gains. The break condition occurs if LLM preferences are inconsistent across sessions or highly temperature-dependent, causing regenerated scales to mismatch the evaluation context.

### Mechanism 2: Task Decomposition Through Component Metrics
Decomposing tasks into multiple component metrics (e.g., progress + feasibility) enables extraction of more inductive bias and reduces scoring variance. Each sub-task generates its own Likert scale, providing multiple independent "views" of the instance. Scores are aggregated (product of ranks for ranking tasks, logistic regression for classification). The decomposition creates a higher-dimensional scoring space with finer granularity. The core assumption is that the component metrics are approximately orthogonal and each captures distinct inductive biases that combine additively. Evidence shows removing metric splitting triples standard deviation (6.36 vs 2.05 Macro F1 SD) while reducing mean performance. The break condition occurs if component metrics are highly correlated, in which case decomposition adds computational overhead without diversity benefit.

### Mechanism 3: Context-Based Scale Application
Including the generated scale in conversation history (rather than as a one-shot instruction) enables consistent application of the calibration criteria across all instances. The scale becomes part of the persistent context. When the LLM is asked to "rate on the previous feasibility scale," it references the scale in context rather than re-interpreting the rating criteria. The core assumption is that LLMs can reliably reference prior context to maintain scoring consistency across multiple queries in a session. Evidence shows IBEaM produces substantially fewer scoring ties than baseline for GPT-4o, suggesting more discriminative/consistent scoring. The break condition occurs if context window limitations require truncation, or if cross-instance contamination occurs, causing consistency to degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- **Inductive bias in language models**
  - Why needed: The entire method rests on the premise that LLMs have implicit preferences for certain prompt wordings. Without understanding this, the extraction mechanism appears circular.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why the same task might yield different outputs with semantically equivalent but differently worded prompts?

- **Likert scale design and ordinal scoring**
  - Why needed: The method generates 10-point scales and uses them for classification/ranking. Understanding ordinality vs. interval properties affects aggregation choices.
  - Quick check: Why might product of ranks be more robust than sum of raw scores for ranking tasks?

- **Calibration in evaluation systems**
  - Why needed: The "matching" in IBEaM is fundamentally a calibration process—aligning the prompt to the model's internal scale.
  - Quick check: If an LLM systematically over-rates instances, would self-calibration correct this or amplify it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Metric Decomposition Module -> Scale Generator -> Evaluation Prompter -> Score Aggregator
- **Critical path**: Define component metrics (human, task-dependent) -> Generate scales once per trial (cached for all instances) -> For each instance: prompt with scale context -> extract rating -> aggregate
- **Design tradeoffs**: More metrics = more API calls + more inductive bias extracted (diminishing returns unclear); logistic regression aggregator requires labeled training data; product-of-ranks does not; regenerating scales per trial increases variance but reduces overfitting risk to any single scale
- **Failure signatures**: High variance across trials (SD > 5% of mean) indicates over-reliance on single metric or unstable scale generation; no improvement over baseline suggests component metrics may be redundant or poorly aligned with task; excessive scoring ties indicates scale granularity insufficient
- **First 3 experiments**: (1) Baseline comparison: On held-out classification task, compare single 1-10 rating baseline vs IBEaM with 2 component metrics, measuring Macro F1 and SD across 5 trials; (2) Ablation check: Remove self-calibration (use human-authored scale) vs full IBEaM, confirming performance drop matches paper's ~5% F1 reduction; (3) Metric correlation analysis: For chosen task, compute correlation between component metric scores, and if r > 0.7, consider alternative decompositions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1: Generative Task Adaptation
Can IBEaM be effectively adapted for open-ended generative tasks? The authors state "IBEaM is not inherently limited to non-comparative classification tasks, but due to the difficulty of quantifying performance in other tasks, we limit the scope of this paper to this type of task." The current method relies on aggregating discrete numeric scores for ranking or classification, which is difficult to apply to free-form text generation. Success would be demonstrated by applying IBEaM to generative tasks (e.g., summarization) using metrics like LLM-as-a-judge to quantify improvements.

### Open Question 2: Metric Decomposition Robustness
How robust is IBEaM to sub-optimal or irrelevant component metrics defined by the user? The method relies on the user to "determine the high-level dimensions that define the task," and results depend on these specific splits (e.g., progress vs. feasibility). It is unclear if performance gains stem from the specific "progress" and "feasibility" distinctions being universally optimal, or if the method is sensitive to poor human intuition. An ablation study testing IBEaM performance when using random, redundant, or semantically weak component metrics would resolve this.

### Open Question 3: Zero-Shot Classification Aggregation
Can the classification aggregation step be replaced with a zero-shot method to eliminate the need for a training set? The authors note that using logistic regression for classification "necessitates the use of a training set for the logistic regression model which is not required for ranking tasks." Requiring a training set for classification reduces the method's universality and few-shot capabilities compared to the ranking variant. Demonstrating that a heuristic or prompt-based aggregator can achieve similar classification performance without fitted parameters would resolve this.

## Limitations
- The WikiHow dataset used for evaluation is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility
- The logistic regression aggregator for classification tasks requires labeled training data, creating a practical barrier for tasks without such data
- The paper does not address computational costs of multiple API calls for metric decomposition

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Empirical results showing IBEaM improves performance over baseline (19% classification accuracy, 27% ranking improvement)
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism of inductive bias extraction through self-calibration (supported by framing bias literature but not directly validated for this specific approach)
- **Low confidence**: Claims about orthogonal component metrics reducing variance (no corpus validation of metric orthogonality)

## Next Checks
1. **Reproduce WikiHow task**: Implement baseline and IBEaM on a held-out ranking task with 5 trials each, measuring accuracy and MRR. Verify the reported 27% improvement margin.
2. **Ablation study**: Compare full IBEaM against version without self-calibration (using human-authored scales) to confirm the ~5% F1 drop reported in Table 3.
3. **Metric correlation analysis**: For a chosen classification task, compute pairwise correlations between component metric scores. If any correlation exceeds 0.7, reconsider the metric decomposition strategy.
