# Enabling Personalized Long-term Interactions in LLM-based Agents through Persistent Memory and User Profiles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07925
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07925
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework integrating persistent memory, user profiles, and agentic coordination improves retrieval accuracy by 5-20% over RAG baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of enabling personalized long-term interactions in LLM-based agents through a framework that integrates persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles. The system combines established agentic AI patterns with memory modules and user profiles to enable personalized responses. The framework is evaluated on three public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and BertScore, showing competitive performance compared to a RAG baseline. A five-day pilot user study provides initial insights into users' perception of personalization, indicating that the system's personalization mechanisms are recognized and appreciated, particularly its ability to recall and integrate past interaction data.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a multi-agent architecture with four specialized agents: Coordinator (routes queries by complexity), Operator (performs multi-source retrieval), Self-Validator (checks retrieval sufficiency), and Response Generator. Memory modules include Short-Term Memory (recent dialogue), summaries, Long-Term Memory (embeddings with LLM-generated tags and related-memory links), and dynamic user profiles (structured JSON). The system uses Model Context Protocol for external resources and web search. Evaluation uses three public datasets (GVD, LoCoMo, LongMemEval) with GPT-4o and Gemini 2 as evaluators, measuring retrieval accuracy, response correctness, contextual coherence, BertScore, and ROUGE-1.

## Key Results
- Retrieval accuracy improved by 5-20% across datasets compared to RAG baseline
- User profile ablation reduced retrieval accuracy by up to 5.6% on GPT-4o
- Pilot study (n=4 completed) showed users recognized and appreciated system's ability to recall previous conversations
- Model-specific behavior observed: Gemini 2 refused memory module instructions, degrading performance with Coordinator

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Agent Coordination for Adaptive Retrieval
- Routing queries through specialized agents based on complexity improves retrieval relevance and contextual reasoning compared to static RAG pipelines
- Coordinator classifies query complexity, routing simple queries directly to generation and complex queries to multi-source retrieval via Operator
- Core assumption: Query complexity can be reliably classified at intake
- Evidence: Up to 20% retrieval accuracy improvement on LoCoMo; ablation shows Coordinator and Self-Validator improve contextual reasoning tasks
- Break condition: Model-specific behavior can invert benefits (Gemini 2 refused memory use despite instructions)

### Mechanism 2: Layered Persistent Memory for Cross-Session Consistency
- Separating memory into distinct modules with different retention horizons enables both immediate contextual relevance and long-term user modeling
- STM stores recent full-text dialogue; summaries capture broader topics; LTM stores condensed embeddings with tags and related-memory links; user profiles store structured key facts
- Core assumption: Information has different temporal relevance and condensed/tagged memories improve retrieval precision
- Evidence: Users highlighted ability to recall previous conversations as key personalization element; layered memory architectures supported in related work
- Break condition: Cold-start problem without interaction history produces generic responses

### Mechanism 3: Implicit User Profile Construction for Tailored Responses
- Implicitly extracting and maintaining structured user profiles from dialogue context improves retrieval accuracy and response relevance
- JSON profile with predefined categories (demographics, preferences, interests, personality, communication style) is incrementally populated by LLM analysis
- Core assumption: Everyday language use provides reliable signals about personality and communication preferences
- Evidence: Removing user profile reduced retrieval accuracy by up to 5.6%; participants noted prior topics influenced future responses
- Break condition: Implicit profiling may miss or misinfer user traits; explicit onboarding could accelerate accuracy but adds friction

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Fundamentals**
  - Why needed: Framework extends RAG with user-specific memory layers and agentic coordination
  - Quick check: Can you explain why standard RAG alone cannot maintain personalized context across sessions?

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns**
  - Why needed: System uses four specialized agents following established patterns (Central Coordination, Planning, Reflection)
  - Quick check: What happens when Self-Validator rejects retrieved context—how does system recover?

- **Memory Management in Stateful Systems**
  - Why needed: Layered memory architecture with different retention policies, embedding strategies, and associative linking
  - Quick check: Why might top-k similarity search alone fail for long-term personalization, and how do tags/related-memory links address this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User Query → Coordinator (route by complexity) → simple: Response Generator | complex: Operator (multi-source retrieval) → Self-Validator (check sufficiency) → Response Generator
- **Critical path:** Coordinator → Operator → Self-Validator → Response Generator. Self-Validator loop can iterate back to Operator if retrieval insufficient. User Profile consulted at both retrieval and generation stages.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Complexity vs. robustness (agents improve reasoning but introduce model-specific failures); implicit vs. explicit profiling (reduces burden but slower convergence); memory granularity (condensed summaries improve precision but may lose nuance)
- **Failure signatures:** Cold-start (generic responses in first interactions); model refusal (some models ignore memory module instructions); generic response style (users reported "LLM-like" responses despite relevant context); engagement drop-off (3/7 participants dropped out after day 1)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline comparison on single dataset: Run agentic system vs. RAG baseline on GVD/LoCoMo with GPT-4o, measuring retrieval accuracy and response correctness (expect 10-20% improvement on retrieval)
  2. Ablation of user profile: Remove user profile component and measure delta in retrieval accuracy and response correctness (expect 3-6% degradation)
  3. Cold-start simulation: Run system with empty memory/profile on first 10 exchanges, then measure personalization metrics (establishes minimum interaction threshold before perceived personalization)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does perceived personalization evolve over extended periods (weeks or months) of continuous interaction compared to short-term pilot studies?
- Basis: Authors explicitly state future work includes longitudinal user study to investigate personalization evolution over weeks
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation limited to five-day pilot with 43% dropout rate
- Evidence: Results from multi-week study tracking changes in perceived personalization scores and user retention

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does integrating proactive dialogue capabilities improve user engagement and sense of being "human-like"?
- Basis: Participants suggested agent should "take initiative and guide conversation," leading to proactive capabilities as primary future direction
- Why unresolved: Framework currently reacts to user input rather than initiating contextually meaningful dialogues
- Evidence: Comparative user study measuring engagement metrics and qualitative "human-likeness" ratings between reactive and proactive agent configurations

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent does efficacy of modular agentic architecture depend on instruction-following capabilities of underlying LLM?
- Basis: Ablation study revealed model-specific behavior (Gemini 2 improved when Coordinator removed due to memory refusal)
- Why unresolved: Results indicate architecture's benefits are not universal across models
- Evidence: Systematic cross-model evaluation measuring instruction adherence and retrieval success rates for sub-agents

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can lightweight onboarding phase effectively mitigate cold-start problem by initializing user profiles with explicit preferences?
- Basis: Authors identify cold-start problem as primary direction, proposing onboarding phase to collect preferences before first interaction
- Why unresolved: Current system relies on implicit learning, producing generic responses until sufficient history accumulates
- Evidence: Comparative analysis of cold-start performance between users with onboarding interview vs. empty profile

## Limitations

- User study provides only initial insights with limited sample size (n=4 completed) and short duration (5 days)
- Claim of "outperforming" baselines is qualified as "competitive" with performance varying significantly by model
- Model-specific failure modes observed (Gemini 2 refused memory module instructions, degrading performance)
- 43% dropout rate in pilot study suggests engagement challenges that may affect personalization perception

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Architectural framework combining persistent memory, user profiles, and agentic coordination is technically sound; ablation studies show each component contributes measurable improvements
- **Medium confidence**: Quantitative benchmark results showing 5-20% improvements over RAG baseline are methodologically rigorous but may not generalize across different model configurations
- **Low confidence**: User study conclusions about personalization perception are preliminary given small sample, high dropout rate, and lack of statistical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct larger-scale user study (n≥20) with statistical power analysis to validate personalization perception metrics and test performance across extended interaction periods (>2 weeks)
2. Implement cross-model validation testing framework with multiple LLM backbones beyond GPT-4o and Gemini 2 to assess generalizability and identify model-specific failure patterns
3. Perform stress testing on memory retrieval performance with conversation histories exceeding 100,000 tokens to evaluate whether layered memory architecture scales for true "long-term" interactions
