# MultiLexNorm++

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16623
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16623
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Extended MultiLexNorm benchmark to five Asian languages (Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese)

## Executive Summary
This paper extends the MultiLexNorm benchmark to five Asian languages, revealing that current state-of-the-art lexical normalization models (particularly UFAL) perform poorly on non-Latin scripts. The authors propose a new LLM-based approach combining detection models, lookup tables, and in-context learning with large language models. Their method shows significant improvements over existing approaches, with GPT-4o achieving the highest error reduction rates across all languages tested. The study highlights that normalization detection, spelling errors, and slang remain key challenges in multilingual lexical normalization.

## Method Summary
The authors extended the MultiLexNorm benchmark to five Asian languages by collecting and annotating normalization data for Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese. They evaluated the performance of existing normalization models (particularly UFAL) on these languages and found substantial performance drops for non-Latin scripts. To address these limitations, they proposed a new LLM-based approach that integrates a detection model to identify non-standard words, a lookup table for common normalization pairs, and in-context learning with large language models. The approach uses GPT-4o and other models to generate normalized outputs based on few-shot examples, showing more robust performance across the new languages compared to traditional normalization methods.

## Key Results
- UFAL model performance drops significantly on non-Latin script languages (Thai, Japanese, Korean)
- GPT-4o achieves highest average ERR of 53.53% across all five Asian languages
- Open-source models (Llama 3.1 70B) underperform commercial models, achieving only 30.87% ERR
- Normalization detection, spelling errors, and slang remain key challenges across all languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-based approach works better because it leverages the few-shot learning capabilities of large language models to handle the diverse normalization patterns across different Asian languages. Unlike traditional rule-based or statistical models, LLMs can adapt to language-specific phenomena like Thai's lack of spaces between words, Japanese's mixed script usage, and Korean's agglutinative morphology. The combination of detection, lookup, and in-context learning allows the system to handle both common normalization patterns and novel cases more effectively than previous approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Lexical Normalization**: The process of converting non-standard words to their canonical forms. Why needed: Essential for improving NLP tasks on user-generated text. Quick check: Can the model convert "gr8" to "great" and "u" to "you"?

**Error Reduction Rate (ERR)**: A metric measuring the percentage reduction in normalization errors compared to a baseline. Why needed: Provides standardized evaluation across different languages and approaches. Quick check: ERR > 0 indicates improvement over baseline.

**In-context Learning**: Few-shot learning approach where models learn from examples provided in the prompt without parameter updates. Why needed: Enables adaptation to new languages without extensive fine-tuning. Quick check: Model performs well on held-out examples from the prompt.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Detection Model -> Lookup Table -> LLM with In-context Learning -> Normalized Output

**Critical Path**: Input text → Detection model identifies non-standard words → Lookup table resolves common cases → LLM handles remaining cases via in-context learning → Final normalized output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational efficiency for accuracy, as LLM inference is more expensive than traditional methods. However, this provides better generalization across languages with different scripts and linguistic phenomena.

**Failure Signatures**: The system struggles with rare slang, highly context-dependent normalization, and cases where cultural appropriateness matters beyond orthographic correctness. Open-source LLMs fail particularly on languages with non-Latin scripts.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate detection model performance on identifying non-standard words across all five languages
2. Test lookup table coverage for common normalization pairs in each language
3. Compare in-context learning performance across different prompt sizes and example selections

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Benchmark coverage limited to five Asian languages, missing major script families like Arabic, Cyrillic, and Indic scripts
- Heavy reliance on closed-source commercial models (GPT-4o) limits reproducibility and practical accessibility
- Does not address cultural or contextual appropriateness of normalized outputs, particularly important for languages like Thai and Japanese

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: UFAL performs poorly on non-Latin script languages - well-supported by empirical results across all five languages with multiple evaluation metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: LLM-based approach with in-context learning is more robust - supported by data but limited by reliance on GPT-4o and substantial performance gap with open-source models.

**Low Confidence**: Normalization detection, spelling errors, and slang remain key challenges - based on error analysis without systematic categorization or statistical validation across languages.

## Next Checks

1. Test benchmark and LLM-based approach on additional Asian languages from underrepresented script families (Arabic, Cyrillic, Indic scripts) to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct head-to-head comparison using only open-source models against commercial APIs to quantify practical accessibility gap and identify specific underperformance areas.

3. Perform qualitative validation with native speakers to assess cultural and contextual appropriateness of normalized outputs, especially for Thai and Japanese where normalization affects meaning and tone.
