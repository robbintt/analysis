# Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.08601
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: DisCoCirc framework shows promise for machine translation between English and Bengali but struggles with non-isomorphic mappings like gendered adjectives, idioms, and causal conjunctions.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the DisCoCirc framework's applicability for machine translation between English and Bengali by extending the formalism to handle structural differences between SOV and SVO languages. The research demonstrates that while DisCoCirc can effectively reduce linguistic bureaucracy for much of the language by abstracting word order through text circuits, it encounters significant limitations when direct translation is impossible. The work introduces an update rule mechanism to refine translations as context builds, but finds the formalism insufficient for fully capturing non-isomorphic mappings such as gendered adjectives, pronouns, and idiomatic expressions. The study concludes that DisCoCirc can assist in translation but requires further extensions to address tense variations, causal conjunctions, and idiomatic expressions for broader accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study develops hybrid grammar production rules for Bengali (SOV structure) and implements a pipeline to convert parse trees to text diagrams, then to text circuits where only connectivity matters. An "update rule" mechanism is introduced to attach attribute nodes to noun wires based on contextual information, helping resolve semantic ambiguities like gender and animacy. The approach relies on bijective terminal-symbol mapping between English and Bengali, with manual construction of example sentences rather than corpus-based validation. The framework is evaluated qualitatively on hand-crafted examples to assess isomorphism between text circuits and identify structural limitations.

## Key Results
- DisCoCirc reduces linguistic bureaucracy effectively for much of the language by abstracting word order differences
- Non-isomorphic mappings occur frequently with gendered adjectives, adpositions, pronouns, and idioms
- Update rule mechanism successfully refines translations as context builds but requires further formalization
- Causal conjunctions remain beyond the framework's current capabilities, requiring implication logic

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Text circuits reduce interlingual structural differences by abstracting away word order.
- **Mechanism**: Hybrid grammar production rules generate tree diagrams → tree diagrams transform into non-planar text diagrams (allowing wire crossings) → text diagrams convert to text circuits where only connectivity matters, not ordering. This layered abstraction means Bengali SOV and English SVO structures can produce equivalent circuits if terminal symbols biject.
- **Core assumption**: Semantic content is preserved through successive diagrammatic simplifications.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "DisCoCirc reduces linguistic bureaucracy effectively for much of the language"
  - [Section 4] "two circuits with identical connectivity but differing only in the ordering of their noun labels are regarded as equivalent"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation of DisCoCirc-specific translation mechanisms found; neighboring papers focus on neural MT/RAG approaches.
- **Break condition**: When terminal symbols lack bijection (e.g., "is" copula has no Bengali equivalent; gendered adjectives fuse morphology with semantics).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Context accumulation via update rules enables incremental translation refinement.
- **Mechanism**: As text progresses, update nodes attach to noun-phrase wires, adding attributes (gender, animacy, honorific status). These attributes resolve ambiguous mappings—e.g., "Billie" gains "person" status from subsequent "He is handsome," triggering Bengali accusative case marker "-kē."
- **Core assumption**: Attributes are monotonically accumulative and don't conflict; downstream context never contradicts earlier inferences.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "An update rule is introduced to refine translations as context builds"
  - [Section 6] "as the text progresses, more and more traits get added to the noun as the context becomes clearer"
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence for this specific update mechanism; standard neural MT uses attention/context vectors differently.
- **Break condition**: When attributes require revision (e.g., misgendering correction) or when context is insufficient even at text end.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Non-causal conjunctions decompose into Boolean AND/NOT compositions in text circuits.
- **Mechanism**: Conjunction types map to operations—"and" → AND (∧), "or" → OR (∨), "either...or" → XOR (⊕), "neither...nor" → NOR (¬A∧¬B), "but" → partial negation (A∧¬B). Each representable via AND (⊗ symbol) and NOT (π symbol) gate compositions.
- **Core assumption**: Conjunction semantics are truth-functional and context-independent.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic"
  - [Section 5] "all conjunctions (except causative ones) between two noun phrases can be written as a composition (parallel or sequential) of [AND] and π [NOT]"
  - [corpus] No corpus validation; neighboring papers don't address logic-based conjunction formalisms.
- **Break condition**: Causal conjunctions ("because," "so," "if") require implication/conditional logic beyond Boolean composition.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: **Category-theoretic composition (monoidal categories)**
  - **Why needed here**: Text circuits are morphisms in a monoidal category; sequential composition (·) and parallel composition (⊗) structure how meanings combine. Understanding wire/box diagrams requires grasping type-matching (domain/codomain) and functorial mapping.
  - **Quick check question**: Given wires A and B, what determines whether two boxes can compose sequentially vs. only in parallel?

- **Concept**: **Hybrid grammar / string rewrite systems**
  - **Why needed here**: Production rules (S ↦ NP·TVP·NP, etc.) generate the underlying trees that feed into diagram construction. Non-terminals rewrite until terminals (underlined words) remain.
  - **Quick check question**: If NP ↦ ADJ·NP and NP ↦ "Millie," what derivation sequence produces "pretty Millie"?

- **Concept**: **Isomorphism vs. surjection in translation mappings**
  - **Why needed here**: The paper claims surjective mapping from Urdu text to circuits (prior work) and tests bijective terminal-symbol mapping for English-Bengali. Non-isomorphic cases (gendered adjectives, idioms) break translation.
  - **Quick check question**: If English {he, she} maps to Bengali {sē} surjectively but not injectively, what information is lost and can context recover it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Hybrid Grammar Engine → Text Diagram Generator → Text Circuit Composer → Update Rule Attacher → Translation Mapper
- **Critical path**: Grammar definition (Section 2) → tree generation → text diagram transformation (Section 3) → circuit composition (Section 4) → update rule attachment (Section 6) → translation via symbol substitution + rule inversion
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Expressiveness vs. isomorphism**: Richer grammar captures more phenomena but increases non-isomorphic mappings
  - **Update-rule frequency**: Earlier updates reduce ambiguity sooner but risk incorrect commits; later updates are more informed but leave longer ambiguous spans
  - **Phase bubbles vs. parallel composition**: Phase bubbles encapsulate sentential complements cleanly but obscure internal structure; parallel composition keeps structure visible but complicates connectivity analysis
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Terminal-symbol mismatch**: Circuit has no target word (e.g., English "is" with no Bengali copula equivalent in present-descriptive sentences)
  - **Attribute conflict**: Update rule assigns contradictory traits (e.g., gender inferred as male then female)
  - **Idiom non-decomposition**: Phrase behaves as single terminal, breaking compositional mapping
  - **Causal conjunction dead-end**: Boolean decomposition fails; no circuit representation available
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Bijective subset test**: Implement grammar→circuit pipeline for a restricted fragment (transitive verbs, no adjectives/adpositions). Verify circuits match between English and Bengali for 50 sentence pairs. Measure where bijection holds/breaks
  2. **Update rule ablation**: For ambiguous-pronoun sentences, compare translation accuracy with vs. without update nodes. Quantify how many gender/honorific errors update rules resolve
  3. **Conjunction stress test**: Generate sentences with each conjunction type (additive, alternative, exclusion, contrast). Confirm circuit decomposition produces correct Boolean structure. Flag causal conjunctions as expected failures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- **Non-isomorphic mappings**: The framework fundamentally cannot handle cases where direct word-for-word translation is impossible, such as gendered adjectives and idioms
- **Causal conjunction handling**: The current Boolean logic decomposition fails for causal conjunctions, requiring implication/conditional logic extensions
- **Update rule formalization**: The mechanism for when and how to attach attribute nodes is conceptual rather than formally specified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- The DisCoCirc framework can generate circuit representations for both English and Bengali sentences following their respective grammars
- Non-isomorphic mappings occur when direct word-for-word translation is impossible (gendered adjectives, idioms)
- The framework's ability to abstract away word order is theoretically sound within its formalism

**Medium Confidence**:
- Update rules can meaningfully resolve translation ambiguities in context
- The Boolean logic decomposition of conjunctions is correct for the non-causal cases examined
- The framework reduces "linguistic bureaucracy" compared to traditional approaches

**Low Confidence**:
- The framework's practical utility for real-world translation tasks
- The frequency and impact of non-isomorphic cases in typical translation scenarios
- The update rule's behavior in complex, contradictory, or noisy contexts

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus-scale isomorphism assessment**: Apply the DisCoCirc pipeline to a parallel English-Bengali corpus (e.g., TED talks or news translations). Quantify what percentage of sentences produce isomorphic circuits versus requiring ad-hoc handling. Measure translation accuracy loss when forcing non-isomorphic cases through the framework.

2. **Update rule stress testing**: Create a benchmark of ambiguous-pronoun sentences where context gradually resolves gender/animacy. Test the update rule's performance across different update frequencies (early vs. late attachment) and measure error rates when context is insufficient or contradictory.

3. **Causal conjunction implementation**: Develop a prototype extension for causal conjunctions using conditional/implicative logic rather than Boolean composition. Test on a corpus of cause-effect sentences and compare translation quality against the baseline (which fails on these cases) and against neural MT approaches.
