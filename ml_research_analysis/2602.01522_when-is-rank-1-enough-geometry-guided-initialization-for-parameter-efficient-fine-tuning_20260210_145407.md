# When Is Rank-1 Enough? Geometry-Guided Initialization for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01522
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01522
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Geometry-aware Gap-Init initialization stabilizes rank-1 LoRA training by aligning with cross-modal modality gaps, matching or exceeding rank-8 baselines across multimodal tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the failure of rank-1 parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in multimodal models by identifying a geometric bottleneck: vision and text features form anisotropic cones whose dominant discrepancy is translation-like, making alignment with this direction critical. Random rank-1 initialization fails because it's nearly orthogonal to this gap direction in high dimensions, suppressing gradients and causing training collapse. The authors propose Gap-Init, which estimates this gap from a small calibration set and initializes LoRA to align with it while keeping the initial update zero. This simple change stabilizes training and matches or exceeds strong rank-8 baselines across captioning, VQA, zero-shot transfer, and hallucination robustness tasks.

## Method Summary
Gap-Init is a geometry-aware initialization strategy for rank-1 LoRA adapters in multimodal models. It first extracts layer-wise modality gap vectors by running a frozen model on a small calibration set of paired image-text samples, computing the difference between vision and text hidden states. The rank-1 LoRA direction (B matrix) is then initialized with the normalized gap vector, while the scaling matrix (A) is set to zero, ensuring the initial update is zero but gradients flow along the gap direction. This preserves the pretrained function at step 0 while enabling strong gradient flow from the first update.

## Key Results
- Rank-1 Gap-Init achieves comparable CIDEr scores to rank-8 baselines on COCO Captioning (~113-114 CIDEr vs ~115-116)
- Reduces seed-wise variance from ±7.10 CIDEr (random init) to ±1.41 CIDEr
- Improves VQA accuracy from ~60.7% (rank-1 random) to ~63.8% (rank-1 Gap-Init), matching rank-8
- Enhances POPE hallucination robustness from ~53.1% to ~57.4% F1, approaching rank-8 performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Orthogonality Catastrophe from High-Dimensional Geometry
Random rank-1 initialization fails because, in high dimensions, a random direction is nearly orthogonal to any fixed direction (the modality gap) with high probability. For a fixed modality gap vector **u** and a randomly initialized rank-1 direction **b** on the sphere S^(d-1), the squared alignment ⟨**u**, **b**⟩² follows a Beta(1/2, (d-1)/2) distribution with mean 1/d. The useful gradient component along **u** is thus suppressed by O(d^(-1/2)). Core assumption: The modality gap direction is the primary signal for early optimization at rank-1. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse." [section 3.1] Proposition 3.1 quantifies concentration; Figure 2 shows empirical alignment near 0 for random init. Break condition: If the target model's hidden dimension is small, or if the modality gap is not a near-translation (multi-axis alignment required), this concentration effect may not dominate.

### Mechanism 2: Translation-Dominant Modality Gap as a Key Alignment Axis
The dominant cross-modal misalignment in vision-language models is approximately a translation between two anisotropic representation cones, making alignment with this translation direction critical for effective updates. Vision and text features occupy narrow, mean-dominated cones. Their discrepancy is well-approximated by a mean-shift vector **g** = μ_text - μ_vision. Under rank-1 constraints, the optimizer can only move along one direction; aligning with **g** preserves non-trivial gradient flow. Core assumption: The translation-like gap captures a substantial portion of the optimization-relevant misalignment; task-specific variance is secondary at early stages. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant 'gap' direction" [section 3.2] "the leading direction captures a non-negligible fraction of the gap variation (e.g., ~16%)" Break condition: If vision-language representations are not cone-like (isotropic), or if alignment requires complex non-linear warping rather than translation, a single gap direction may be insufficient.

### Mechanism 3: Gap-Init Provides Directional Pre-Alignment Without Changing Function
Initializing the rank-1 LoRA direction with the normalized gap vector (Gap-Init) preserves the pretrained function at step 0 while enabling strong gradient flow along the gap axis from the first update. For rank-1 LoRA ΔW = **ba**^⊤, Gap-Init sets **b** ← **g**/‖**g**‖ and **a** ← **0**. This ensures ΔW = **0** at initialization but ∇_a L ∝ **b**^⊤ ∇_h L · **x**^⊤, directly projecting gradients onto the gap direction. Core assumption: The gap direction estimated from a small calibration set is representative of the target task's alignment needs. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero." [section 4.3] "Setting A^(ℓ) = 0 ensures ΔW^(ℓ) = 0 at initialization... the gradient with respect to A^(ℓ) directly projects gradients onto the modality-gap direction itself." Break condition: If the calibration set distribution differs significantly from the target task domain, the estimated gap may misalign, degrading performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: High-dimensional concentration of measure
  - Why needed here: Explains why random directions become nearly orthogonal to fixed axes as dimension grows, causing gradient suppression.
  - Quick check question: For d=4096, what is the expected squared cosine similarity between a random unit vector and a fixed direction? (Answer: ~1/4096 ≈ 0.00024)

- Concept: Anisotropy and cone structure in neural embeddings
  - Why needed here: Motivates why vision/text features cluster in narrow cones, making their mean difference a salient alignment target.
  - Quick check question: If embeddings were isotropic (spherical), would a single translation direction dominate cross-modal discrepancy?

- Concept: LoRA parameterization and zero-initialization
  - Why needed here: Understanding ΔW = BA with B or A zero-initialized clarifies how Gap-Init changes gradient flow without altering the initial forward pass.
  - Quick check question: With A=0 and B non-zero, what is the effective update ΔW at initialization? What is the gradient w.r.t. A?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pretrained MLLM (vision encoder + projection + language model) -> LoRA adapters (rank-1) inserted into target linear layers -> Calibration pass extracts layer-wise vision/text hidden states -> Compute and store gap vectors **g**^(ℓ) -> Gap-Init: initialize B^(ℓ) ← **g**^(ℓ)/‖**g**^(ℓ)‖, A^(ℓ) ← 0 -> Standard fine-tuning

- Critical path:
  1. Run calibration on small paired image-text set (256 samples typical)
  2. For each target layer, compute and store gap vector
  3. Initialize LoRA parameters using Gap-Init
  4. Proceed with standard fine-tuning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Calibration set size vs. estimation noise (256 samples recommended; 16 too noisy)
  - Domain specificity of gap vs. generalization (OOD calibration hurts; mixed-domain can help slightly)
  - Layer selection: naive top-k vs. GG-Safe (SPOT-Gap guided); Gap-Init is robust even with naive selection

- Failure signatures:
  - CIDEr score collapses near 100 or below for rank-1 random init (severe instability across seeds)
  - High variance across random seeds (std ~7 CIDEr for random vs. ~1.4 for Gap-Init)
  - Performance degradation with OOD calibration data (e.g., Flickr30k when training on COCO)
  - Noise level ε=1.0 destroys directional information, causing collapse

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the orthogonality check: plot the distribution of cosine similarities between random rank-1 directions and estimated gap vector for your model; confirm concentration near 0.
  2. Run rank-1 LoRA with random initialization vs. Gap-Init on a captioning benchmark; compare CIDEr scores and seed-wise variance.
  3. Ablate calibration domain: compare in-domain vs. OOD vs. mixed-domain calibration; verify domain specificity and modest regularization from diversity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- Domain sensitivity: OOD calibration data significantly degrades performance, requiring careful domain matching
- Strong simplifying assumption: Single dominant gap direction may not capture complex alignment needs for all tasks
- Limited architecture scope: Experiments focus on BLIP-2 OPT-2.7B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Gemma3-4B, leaving generalization uncertain

## Confidence
- Geometric bottleneck mechanism (orthogonality concentration): High - Proposition 3.1 and empirical alignment plots provide strong evidence
- Gap-Init effectiveness: Medium - Validated for in-domain calibration but domain sensitivity not fully characterized
- Claims about generality across architectures and tasks: Low - Limited to specific multimodal models and task types

## Next Checks
1. **Orthogonality Concentration Verification**: Reproduce Figure 2's alignment distribution plot for your target model to confirm that random rank-1 directions are indeed nearly orthogonal to the estimated gap vector, with cosine similarity concentrated near zero.

2. **Gap-Init vs. Random Init Stability**: Run rank-1 LoRA with both initialization strategies on a representative captioning benchmark, measuring not just average CIDEr but seed-wise variance across at least 5 random seeds to confirm Gap-Init's stability advantage.

3. **Calibration Domain Sensitivity**: Systematically compare in-domain vs. OOD vs. mixed-domain calibration sets (using established splits) to characterize the tradeoff between domain specificity and regularization from diversity.
