# VideoAgent: Personalized Synthesis of Scientific Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.11253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11253
- Reference count: 0
- VideoAgent significantly outperforms commercial services in generating scientific videos with superior narration, visual, and synchronization quality

## Executive Summary
VideoAgent addresses the challenge of automating scientific video generation by proposing a multi-agent framework that orchestrates both static slides and dynamic animations through a conversational interface. The system parses source papers into fine-grained multimodal assets and uses a planner to determine when to employ static slides or dynamic animations based on user requirements. To evaluate performance, the authors introduce SciVidEval, combining automated metrics for narration, visual, and synchronization quality with a Video-Quiz-based human evaluation measuring knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that VideoAgent variants significantly outperform commercial services, achieving narration quality (PPL: 18.08, Rouge-L: 0.16), visual quality (VLM-as-Judge: 8.03), and synchronization (VLM-as-Judge: 6.58). The knowledge transfer evaluation demonstrates near-human-level performance with 99.5% automated VLM-as-Judge scores and 87.5% human evaluation accuracy.

## Method Summary
VideoAgent employs a multi-agent framework consisting of a Planner, Narrator, Visual Generator, and Synthesizer agents working in coordination. The system begins by parsing scientific papers into structured components including paper outline, table parsing, and figure parsing. Based on user requirements, the Planner determines whether to use static slides or dynamic animations for each content segment. The Narrator generates clear, coherent voiceovers aligned with the paper's structure, while the Visual Generator creates relevant imagery and animations. The Synthesizer agent then coordinates the final video assembly, ensuring proper synchronization between audio and visual elements. The system supports conversational interaction, allowing users to provide iterative feedback and preferences throughout the generation process.

## Key Results
- VideoAgent variants achieved superior narration quality with PPL: 18.08 and Rouge-L: 0.16 compared to commercial services
- Visual quality scored 8.03 on VLM-as-Judge metric, demonstrating high-quality scientific imagery generation
- Knowledge transfer evaluation showed near-human performance with 99.5% automated VLM-as-Judge scores and 87.5% human evaluation accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its multi-agent architecture that separates concerns between content planning, narration generation, visual creation, and synthesis coordination. By distinguishing between static and dynamic content needs through the Planner agent, the system can apply appropriate generation strategies for different types of scientific information. The conversational interface enables iterative refinement and personalization, allowing the system to adapt to user preferences and feedback throughout the generation process. The comprehensive evaluation framework combining automated metrics with human assessment provides robust validation of both technical quality and pedagogical effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Paper Parsing and Structure Extraction**: Why needed - to understand scientific paper organization; Quick check - verify extracted sections match original paper structure
- **Multimodal Asset Generation**: Why needed - to create both textual and visual content for videos; Quick check - confirm narration and visuals align semantically
- **Content Planning for Static vs Dynamic Elements**: Why needed - different scientific content requires different presentation approaches; Quick check - validate planner correctly identifies animation-worthy content
- **Synchronization of Audio-Visual Elements**: Why needed - scientific videos require precise timing for effective knowledge transfer; Quick check - measure audio-visual alignment accuracy
- **Automated Quality Evaluation with VLM-as-Judge**: Why needed - scalable assessment of video quality; Quick check - compare VLM scores with human judgments

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Paper Parser -> Planner -> Narrator/Visual Generator -> Synthesizer -> Video Output

Critical Path: Paper Parsing → Content Planning → Narration Generation → Visual Generation → Video Synthesis

Design Tradeoffs: The system prioritizes quality over speed, using multiple specialized agents rather than a single end-to-end model. This increases computational cost but enables better handling of complex scientific content. The conversational interface adds user interaction overhead but enables personalization and iterative refinement.

Failure Signatures: Poor paper parsing leads to incorrect content organization; planner errors result in inappropriate static/dynamic choices; narration-visual misalignment indicates synthesizer failures; low VLM-as-Judge scores suggest quality issues in generation components.

First Experiments: 1) Test paper parsing accuracy on papers from different scientific domains; 2) Evaluate planner's static/dynamic classification on varied content types; 3) Measure narration-visual synchronization accuracy across different video lengths.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Knowledge transfer evaluation tested only one paper (Arora et al. 2001), limiting generalizability across scientific domains
- Automated VLM-as-Judge metrics rely on a single GPT-4V model which may have inherent biases
- System limited to videos under 10 minutes, insufficient for comprehensive scientific presentations

## Confidence

| Major Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| Superiority over commercial services | High |
| Effectiveness of multi-agent framework | High |
| Knowledge transfer evaluation validity | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Expand knowledge transfer evaluation to include papers from diverse scientific domains and complexity levels to validate generalizability
2. Conduct cross-validation with multiple VLM-as-Judge models to assess robustness and identify potential model-specific biases
3. Test system's ability to generate longer videos (exceeding 10 minutes) and evaluate coherence and quality of extended scientific presentations
