# Safe Exploration via Policy Priors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19612
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19612
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Guarantees constraint satisfaction throughout learning while achieving sublinear cumulative regret in continuous control tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SOOPER, a scalable algorithm for safe exploration in continuous control tasks. It uses offline- or simulation-trained conservative policies as pessimistic priors to maintain safety during online learning, while leveraging probabilistic world models for optimistic exploration. The method guarantees constraint satisfaction throughout learning and achieves sublinear cumulative regret, improving over prior approaches that only ensure safety at the final iteration. Experiments on multiple RL benchmarks and real-world robotic hardware show that SOOPER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art safe RL baselines in both safety and performance.

## Method Summary
SOOPER combines a pessimistic policy prior for safety with optimistic exploration via probabilistic world models. The agent maintains a model ensemble to estimate dynamics uncertainty, and uses this to compute intrinsic rewards that balance exploration within the safe set and expansion of the known safe region. During execution, a safety monitor tracks cumulative cost and switches to the conservative prior when predicted future cost exceeds the safety budget. The method reformulates constrained MDPs using termination states with pessimistic terminal rewards, allowing standard RL methods to solve constrained problems. Theoretical analysis proves sublinear regret and constraint satisfaction throughout learning, with empirical validation across multiple benchmark tasks and real robotic hardware.

## Key Results
- Achieves sublinear cumulative regret O(Γ^(7/2) log(N) / √N) while maintaining constraint satisfaction throughout learning
- Outperforms state-of-the-art safe RL baselines (SafeMPC, CPO, RCPO) on SafetyGym and RWRL benchmarks
- Demonstrates successful transfer to real-world robotic hardware with 60 Hz control frequency
- Maintains safety even when the prior policy is initially poor, with performance improving as the model learns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Pessimistic Policy Prior as Safety Backup
Switching to a conservative policy prior when accumulated cost plus predicted future cost exceeds the safety budget maintains constraint satisfaction throughout learning. At each timestep, the agent computes Φ(st, at, c<t, Q̂πc,n) = c<t + γ^t Q̂πc,n(st, at). If this exceeds the safety budget d, the prior policy π̂ is invoked instead of the learned policy πn. Since π̂ is pessimistic (trained under worst-case dynamics), it provides a guaranteed-safe fallback trajectory. The safety guarantee holds if the prior satisfies the constraint under all plausible dynamics in F0 and the model Fn remains well-calibrated.

### Mechanism 2: Intrinsic Rewards for Exploration and Implicit Safe Set Expansion
Augmenting rewards with uncertainty-weighted bonuses drives exploration while implicitly expanding the set of policies deemed safe. The objective adds (γ^t λexplore + √(γ^t) λexpand) ||σn(st, at)|| to the reward. λexplore drives exploration within the currently-known safe set, while λexpand encourages visiting states that reduce epistemic uncertainty, which shrinks the model's confidence bounds and expands the implicit safe policy set Π<d^n over iterations. This dual-bonus structure enables both safe exploration and efficient convergence to high-performing policies.

### Mechanism 3: Termination-Based Reformulation of CMDPs
Converting constraint violations into early terminations with pessimistic terminal rewards allows standard RL methods to solve constrained problems. The planning MDP M̃f transitions to an absorbing terminal state s† whenever Φ(st, at, c<t, Q̂πc,n) ≥ d. The terminal reward is set to the pessimistic value of the prior V̂πr(st), which incentivizes the agent to avoid triggering the prior by finding higher-return paths that stay within the safety budget. This eliminates the need for constrained optimization or min-max formulations while maintaining safety guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

- **Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs):**
  - Why needed here: SOOPER operates on CMDPs where agents maximize rewards subject to cost constraints. Understanding the distinction between Jr(π) (objective) and Jc(π) (constraint) is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why optimizing Jr alone might lead to constraint violations, and why the Lagrangian approach is insufficient for online exploration?

- **Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty in Dynamics Models:**
  - Why needed here: The method relies on probabilistic world models where σn captures reducible epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty drives both safety margins (pessimism) and exploration bonuses (optimism).
  - Quick check question: Given an ensemble of neural networks, how would you extract an epistemic uncertainty estimate, and why might this differ from aleatoric noise variance?

- **Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) Principle:**
  - Why needed here: SOOPER uses OFU for exploration (intrinsic rewards) while combining it with pessimism for safety. Understanding this duality is central.
  - Quick check question: In standard UCRL, optimism encourages visiting uncertain states. How does SOOPER prevent this from causing constraint violations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Probabilistic Ensemble Dynamics Model → Pessimistic Cost Q-Function → Policy πn → Safety Monitor → Prior Policy π̂
- **Critical path:** Initialize prior π̂ and model F0 from offline/simulation data → For each episode: collect safe rollout (Algorithm 1) → update model → train Q̂πc,n and πn on M̃f → The key coupling point is the safety condition Φ, which gates all online actions
- **Design tradeoffs:** λpessimism: Higher values increase safety margin but reduce exploration efficiency; λexplore + λexpand: Controls exploration-expansion balance; Model ensemble size: Larger ensembles improve uncertainty estimates but increase compute; Termination horizon Tn: Longer rollouts improve credit assignment but delay safety feedback
- **Failure signatures:** Frequent prior invocations that don't decrease over iterations → model uncertainty not shrinking or λexpand too low; Constraint violations → prior not truly safe, model miscalibrated, or λpessimism insufficient; Stagnant performance → exploration bonuses too low, or intrinsic reward scaling mismatched to task rewards; High variance across seeds → ensemble instability or hyperparameter sensitivity
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Validate safety mechanism in isolation: Run Algorithm 1 with a fixed prior and random πn on a simple constraint task (e.g., 2D navigation with obstacles). Verify no constraint violations occur even with random actions.
  2. Ablate intrinsic reward components: Compare (λexplore only), (λexpand only), (both), and (neither) on a medium-complexity task. Measure cumulative regret and prior invocation frequency.
  3. Test robustness to prior quality: Train priors with varying conservatism levels (via domain randomization intensity). Evaluate whether SOOPER maintains safety and converges regardless of initial prior performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can SOOPER's safety and regret guarantees be extended to the non-episodic setting where the agent learns from a single trajectory without manual resets? The conclusion explicitly identifies developing methods for the "non-episodic setting, where agents learn from a single trajectory without resets," as a challenging and crucial problem. The current theoretical analysis and Algorithm 1 rely on episodic rollouts truncated after Tn steps with resets to the initial state distribution.

### Open Question 2
How can the framework be adapted to provide guarantees on high-probability constraints over particular states rather than just cumulative cost constraints? The conclusion lists extending the work to "high-probability constraints over particular states" as a key theoretical challenge. The current CMDP formulation strictly bounds the expected discounted cumulative cost (Jc ≤ d), which allows for transient violations of specific state constraints as long as the aggregate cost remains low.

### Open Question 3
How robust is the safety guarantee to violations in the "safe policy prior" assumption caused by estimation errors or distribution shifts? The safety proof relies entirely on Assumption 4, which posits access to a prior satisfying the constraint under true dynamics. However, obtaining such a prior from imperfect offline data or simulators is difficult. The paper does not quantify the theoretical or empirical degradation of safety if the provided prior is slightly unsafe (i.e., ε-feasible).

## Limitations
- Safety guarantees depend critically on the conservatism of the policy prior and accuracy of uncertainty estimates in the dynamics model
- Performance improvements primarily demonstrated on benchmark tasks with well-defined constraints, leaving open questions about scalability to more complex real-world scenarios
- Theoretical analysis assumes access to well-calibrated probabilistic models and conservative priors, which may be difficult to obtain in practice

## Confidence

- Safety mechanism (prior-based fallback): High - Theorem 1 provides rigorous guarantees given assumptions
- Performance improvement claims: Medium - Strong empirical results but limited to specific benchmark tasks
- Scalability and real-world applicability: Low - Hardware experiment shows feasibility but lacks extensive validation across diverse conditions

## Next Checks

1. Stress-test the safety mechanism by intentionally degrading the prior policy quality and measuring constraint violation rates
2. Evaluate model uncertainty calibration across different ensemble sizes and architectures on tasks with known ground truth dynamics
3. Test transfer capability by training priors on significantly different dynamics distributions and measuring safe exploration performance
