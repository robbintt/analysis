# Empowering Time Series Analysis with Synthetic Data: A Survey and Outlook in the Era of Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.11411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11411
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews synthetic data generation methods for time series foundation models (TSFMs) and large language model-based time series models (TSLLMs).

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of synthetic data generation methods for time series foundation models (TSFMs) and large language model-based time series models (TSLLMs). The authors analyze three main approaches to synthetic data generation: statistical, simulator-based, and data-driven methods. The survey examines how synthetic data are applied across pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation stages of foundation models, while identifying key limitations in current methodologies. Future directions include improving data realism, building human-in-the-loop frameworks, and developing self-improvement capabilities for synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews existing literature on synthetic data generation for time series foundation models, categorizing approaches into statistical, simulator-based, and data-driven methods. It analyzes the application of synthetic data across three model development stages: pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The authors identify four representative TSFM synthetic generation techniques and three TSLLM text generation approaches, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of current methodologies and their applications in time series analysis.

## Key Results
- The survey identifies lack of systematic integration, absence of data-driven methods, and insufficient validation of time series-text alignment as key limitations
- Future directions include improving data realism, building human-in-the-loop frameworks, and developing self-improvement capabilities
- Four representative TSFM synthetic generation techniques and three TSLLM text generation approaches are analyzed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a structured framework for understanding synthetic data generation in the context of foundation models for time series analysis. By categorizing approaches and examining their applications across different model development stages, it creates a comprehensive taxonomy that helps researchers and practitioners navigate the rapidly evolving field. The mechanism relies on systematic literature review and synthesis of existing methodologies to identify patterns, limitations, and future opportunities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series foundation models**: Need to understand the architecture and training paradigms of large-scale models that can handle sequential data across domains
  - Quick check: Verify model architecture specifications and training objectives in cited papers
- **Synthetic data generation**: Requires knowledge of statistical methods, simulation techniques, and data-driven approaches for creating artificial time series data
  - Quick check: Assess the diversity and quality metrics used to evaluate synthetic data
- **Transfer learning in time series**: Understanding how pretraining on synthetic data can improve downstream task performance
  - Quick check: Examine performance gains reported when using synthetic pretraining data
- **Time series-text alignment**: Critical for ensuring that synthetic time series data accurately represents the textual descriptions or labels used in TSLLMs
  - Quick check: Review validation methods for alignment quality between time series and text
- **Foundation model evaluation**: Need to understand appropriate metrics and benchmarks for assessing model performance on time series tasks
  - Quick check: Verify that evaluation metrics are domain-appropriate and standardized
- **Human-in-the-loop frameworks**: Understanding how expert feedback can improve synthetic data generation and model performance
  - Quick check: Assess the practical implementation and effectiveness of human feedback mechanisms

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Sources -> Synthetic Generation Methods -> Model Development (Pretraining/Fine-tuning/Evaluation) -> Performance Assessment
**Critical Path**: Statistical/Simulator/Data-driven Methods -> Synthetic Data Creation -> Foundation Model Training -> Downstream Task Application
**Design Tradeoffs**: Realism vs. diversity in synthetic data generation; computational cost vs. data quality; domain specificity vs. generalizability
**Failure Signatures**: Poor time series-text alignment; lack of domain-specific patterns; insufficient diversity leading to overfitting; computational bottlenecks in generation
**First Experiments**: 1) Compare synthetic data generation methods on standardized time series benchmarks; 2) Test time series-text alignment quality using automated metrics; 3) Implement human-in-the-loop framework with domain experts to evaluate feedback integration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential selection bias in reviewed methods, possibly missing emerging techniques published after survey cutoff
- Confidence in synthetic data effectiveness relies on individual study results rather than systematic meta-analyses
- Uneven analysis coverage between TSFM and TSLLM approaches, with weaker validation of time series-text alignment

## Confidence
- Selection bias claims: Medium
- Effectiveness of synthetic data: Medium
- Time series-text alignment validation: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic benchmark comparisons of synthetic data generation methods across standardized time series datasets to quantify relative performance improvements
2. Design controlled experiments specifically testing time series-text alignment quality when using synthetic data for TSLLMs
3. Implement and evaluate the proposed human-in-the-loop framework with multiple domain experts to assess practical usability and improvement cycles
