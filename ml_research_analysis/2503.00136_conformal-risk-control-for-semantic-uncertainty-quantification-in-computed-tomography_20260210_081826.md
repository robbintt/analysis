- Key outcome: Semantic-CRC provides tighter uncertainty intervals than standard pixel-wise methods while ensuring valid coverage for CT reconstruction tasks

## Executive Summary
This work introduces conformal risk control (CRC) for organ-dependent uncertainty estimation in CT reconstruction. The method constructs semantically adaptive uncertainty intervals by leveraging segmentation models that assign each pixel to an organ group, then minimizes mean interval length via convex optimization. This semantic-CRC (sem-CRC) approach provides tighter uncertainty intervals than standard pixel-wise methods while ensuring valid coverage. Experiments on denoising and FBP-UNet reconstruction tasks using real-world datasets show sem-CRC consistently achieves the shortest intervals while maintaining risk control at 0.10 tolerance.

## Method Summary
The semantic-CRC framework extends standard conformal risk control by incorporating semantic information from organ segmentation models. The approach begins with a semantic segmentation model (nnU-Net) that assigns each pixel to an organ group, creating organ-dependent data splits. For each organ group, conformal risk control is applied separately to construct uncertainty intervals that satisfy the risk control constraint. The method then solves a convex optimization problem to minimize the mean interval length across all pixels while maintaining the specified risk tolerance. This semantic adaptation allows for tighter uncertainty intervals that reflect the varying model performance across different anatomical structures, rather than applying uniform uncertainty estimates across the entire image.

## Key Results
- Semantic-CRC consistently achieves shorter mean interval lengths than standard pixel-wise methods (8.72×10^-2 vs 9.37×10^-2 for K-CRC in denoising)
- Maintains valid risk control at 0.10 tolerance across all tested scenarios
- Provides organ-specific uncertainty estimation capability for clinical needs
- Generates sharper uncertainty maps with organ-specific boundaries that are more clinically interpretable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Semantic-CRC works by recognizing that CT reconstruction models perform differently across anatomical structures. By segmenting images into organ groups and applying conformal risk control separately to each group, the method can adapt uncertainty estimates to the specific characteristics and model performance of each organ. This semantic adaptation allows for tighter intervals where the model is more reliable and appropriately wider intervals where performance is lower, all while maintaining valid coverage. The convex optimization framework ensures that the overall risk constraint is satisfied while minimizing interval length.

## Foundational Learning
- Conformal risk control: A statistical framework for uncertainty quantification that provides coverage guarantees; needed to ensure valid uncertainty intervals; quick check: verify risk control parameter satisfies coverage requirements
- Semantic segmentation: Assigning each pixel to an anatomical structure; needed to create organ-dependent uncertainty estimates; quick check: evaluate segmentation accuracy with Dice scores
- Convex optimization: Mathematical framework for minimizing mean interval length; needed to find optimal uncertainty intervals; quick check: verify convexity of the optimization problem
- CT reconstruction: Process of creating images from projection data; needed as the application domain; quick check: validate reconstruction quality metrics
- nnU-Net: State-of-the-art segmentation architecture; needed for reliable organ grouping; quick check: assess segmentation performance on target datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Image Reconstruction -> Organ Segmentation -> Semantic Data Splitting -> Conformal Risk Control (per organ) -> Convex Optimization -> Uncertainty Intervals

### Critical Path
The critical path flows from reconstruction output through segmentation to uncertainty estimation. The organ segmentation must be performed first to create the semantic splits, then conformal risk control is applied to each organ group independently. The convex optimization step combines these organ-specific intervals into a final uncertainty map while minimizing overall interval length.

### Design Tradeoffs
The main tradeoff is between segmentation accuracy and uncertainty quality. More accurate segmentation enables better semantic grouping and tighter intervals, but segmentation errors can propagate to uncertainty estimates. The method trades computational complexity (running CRC separately for each organ) for improved uncertainty quantification. There's also a balance between risk tolerance and interval length - tighter risk control leads to wider intervals.

### Failure Signatures
Failure occurs when segmentation errors lead to incorrect organ grouping, causing uncertainty intervals to be either too tight (missing true errors) or too wide (overly conservative). If the convex optimization problem is not properly constrained, the solution may violate the risk control requirement. Poor segmentation can also lead to mixing of organ regions, degrading the semantic adaptation benefit.

### First Experiments
1. Validate semantic-CRC on a simple denoising task with known ground truth to establish baseline performance
2. Compare semantic-CRC against pixel-wise CRC on a multi-organ CT dataset to quantify interval length improvements
3. Test organ-specific risk control by evaluating coverage separately for different anatomical structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Semantic segmentation model performance directly impacts uncertainty quality, with segmentation errors propagating to uncertainty estimates
- Evaluation focuses on binary classification between ground truth and reconstructions, potentially missing complex clinical error patterns
- Clinical interpretability of organ-specific uncertainties requires validation with medical experts

## Confidence
- Semantic-CRC provides tighter uncertainty intervals than standard pixel-wise methods: High
- Organ-specific risk control addresses clinical needs: Medium
- Uncertainty maps are more clinically interpretable: Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate segmentation model accuracy: Evaluate nnU-Net segmentation performance on the specific CT datasets used, including organ-wise Dice scores and failure cases
2. Test on additional clinical scenarios: Apply sem-CRC to other CT reconstruction tasks beyond denoising and FBP-UNet, such as metal artifact reduction or low-dose reconstruction
3. Expert clinical validation: Conduct a formal study with radiologists to assess whether organ-specific uncertainty information improves clinical decision-making or interpretation accuracy compared to standard methods
