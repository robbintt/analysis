# Deep Learning for Perishable Inventory Systems with Human Knowledge
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.15589
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15589
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Structure-guided deep learning with projected inventory level policies consistently outperforms black-box approaches for perishable inventory management

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of developing data-driven ordering policies for perishable inventory systems with unknown demand and lead time processes. The authors propose using marginal cost accounting to derive a per-order loss function suitable for end-to-end learning, enabling neural networks to optimize inventory decisions. They develop two neural network architectures - a black-box model (E2E-BB) and a structure-guided model (E2E-PIL) that embeds the projected inventory level policy - and show that incorporating human knowledge about effective heuristics can improve learning efficiency and generalization performance.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle perishable inventory management by formulating it as a reinforcement learning problem with unknown demand and lead time distributions. They use marginal cost accounting to derive a per-order loss function that attributes intertemporal costs to individual ordering decisions. Two neural network architectures are proposed: E2E-BB as a black-box approach and E2E-PIL which incorporates the projected inventory level policy structure. The E2E-PIL model uses inventory state only to compute projected on-hand inventory while learning a target level from features. They further introduce a constant scaling enhancement (E2E-BPIL) based on operational data analytics, leveraging the homogeneity of degree one property of the induced objective.

## Key Results
- E2E-PIL consistently outperforms E2E-BB across experiments, demonstrating that structure-guided learning improves performance
- E2E-BPIL provides additional improvements over E2E-PIL, validating the effectiveness of constant scaling enhancement
- Theoretical analysis shows that embedding effective heuristic structure can reduce generalization error without increasing approximation error

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing the key challenge of intertemporal cost attribution in perishable inventory systems. Traditional inventory policies like (s,S) or (r,Q) require estimating demand distributions and tuning parameters, which becomes intractable with perishable items and unknown lead times. The marginal cost accounting approach allows attributing the total cost to individual ordering decisions, making it suitable for end-to-end learning. By embedding the projected inventory level policy structure, the model leverages human knowledge about effective heuristics while allowing the neural network to learn optimal parameters from data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Marginal Cost Accounting**: Needed to attribute total intertemporal costs to individual ordering decisions for end-to-end learning. Quick check: Verify that per-order loss correctly captures the contribution of each decision to total system cost.
- **Projected Inventory Level Policy**: Needed as an effective heuristic for perishable inventory management that balances freshness requirements with service levels. Quick check: Confirm that the policy maintains adequate inventory while minimizing waste.
- **Neural Network Architecture Design**: Needed to balance model expressiveness with generalization capability. Quick check: Compare performance of black-box versus structure-guided approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Demand Features -> Neural Network -> Order Quantity -> Inventory Dynamics -> Cost
**Critical Path**: Input features → Policy network → Order decision → Inventory projection → Cost calculation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Black-box (E2E-BB) offers maximum flexibility but requires more data and may overfit; structure-guided (E2E-PIL) incorporates human knowledge to improve learning efficiency and generalization
**Failure Signatures**: Poor demand forecasting leading to excessive waste or stockouts; incorrect cost parameter estimation affecting the marginal cost accounting; overfitting on synthetic data not generalizing to real-world scenarios
**First Experiments**: 1) Compare E2E-BB versus E2E-PIL on synthetic data with known demand distributions; 2) Test E2E-BPIL enhancement on real inventory data; 3) Conduct ablation study on marginal cost accounting components

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes specific demand distributions that may not generalize to real-world scenarios with heavy-tailed or multimodal distributions
- Marginal cost accounting approach relies on accurate cost parameter estimation which may be challenging in practice
- Experiments primarily focus on synthetic data and one real dataset, limiting generalizability across different perishable product categories

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology (marginal cost accounting, projected inventory level policies) is well-established and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical performance improvements shown on real data, though the single dataset limits broader claims
- **Medium confidence**: The generalization bounds and excess risk decomposition, as these rely on specific assumptions about the function class and demand distributions

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed architectures on diverse real-world perishable inventory datasets across multiple product categories (e.g., dairy, produce, seafood) to validate cross-domain generalization
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on cost parameter estimation errors to assess robustness of the marginal cost accounting approach
3. Implement an online A/B testing framework in actual retail operations to measure real-world performance impact versus traditional inventory management methods
