# MAM: Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis via Role-Specialized Collaboration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19835
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19835
- Authors: Yucheng Zhou; Lingran Song; Jianbing Shen
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Modular multi-agent framework with specialized roles achieves 18%-365% performance gains over modality-specific LLMs

## Executive Summary
MAM introduces a novel modular multi-agent framework for multi-modal medical diagnosis that emulates collaborative human medical teams through role-specialized agents. The framework assigns five distinct roles (General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, Director) to LLM-based agents, enabling efficient knowledge updates and flexible integration of existing models. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate MAM consistently outperforms unified multimodal medical LLMs, with performance gains ranging from 18% to 365% across different modalities.

## Method Summary
The MAM framework employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where each agent has a specialized role mirroring human medical team collaboration. The system processes medical data across text, image, audio, and video modalities through role-specific reasoning and collaborative decision-making. A Director agent orchestrates the workflow, while Medical Assistant handles information retrieval, General Practitioner provides initial assessments, Specialist Team focuses on domain-specific expertise, and Radiologist specializes in imaging interpretation. The modular design allows individual components to be updated without affecting the entire system, addressing the challenge of maintaining medical knowledge in rapidly evolving fields.

## Key Results
- MAM achieves 18%-365% performance improvements over modality-specific LLMs across diverse medical datasets
- Knowledge update efficiency demonstrated through experiments showing performance gains with minimal retraining
- Modular architecture successfully integrates existing models while maintaining superior diagnostic accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from role specialization that reduces cognitive load on individual agents while leveraging collaborative reasoning. By decomposing complex medical diagnosis into specialized subtasks, each agent can focus on its expertise area, leading to more accurate and efficient processing. The modular design enables targeted knowledge updates without requiring full system retraining, critical for medical domains where new information emerges rapidly.

## Foundational Learning
- **Role specialization**: Dividing medical diagnosis tasks among specialized agents reduces individual cognitive burden and improves accuracy. Quick check: Compare performance of specialized vs. unified agents on identical tasks.
- **Collaborative reasoning**: Multi-agent systems benefit from information sharing and consensus-building, mimicking effective human medical teams. Quick check: Measure performance impact of removing collaboration between agents.
- **Modular architecture**: Separating knowledge components allows targeted updates without system-wide retraining, essential for medical applications. Quick check: Update single module and measure overall system performance change.
- **Multi-modal processing**: Combining different data types (text, image, audio, video) provides more comprehensive diagnostic information. Quick check: Compare diagnostic accuracy using single vs. multiple modalities.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Director -> General Practitioner -> Specialist Team -> Radiologist -> Medical Assistant

**Critical Path**: Patient data → Medical Assistant (retrieval) → General Practitioner (assessment) → Specialist Team (domain expertise) → Radiologist (imaging) → Director (final diagnosis)

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes flexibility and knowledge efficiency over raw computational speed, accepting some latency for more accurate diagnoses and easier maintenance.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when knowledge retrieval fails (12.1%-34.0% recall), when agent coordination breaks down, or when module updates create inconsistencies.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Measure baseline diagnostic accuracy with all modules vs. with Medical Assistant module disabled
2. Test knowledge update efficiency by modifying one module and measuring system-wide impact
3. Compare performance using 3 vs. 5 agent roles to identify optimal team size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the MAM framework perform in real-world clinical settings compared to standard diagnostic workflows?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly identify the "absence of real-world clinical validation" as a limitation and propose it for future work.
- Why unresolved: Current experiments are restricted to publicly accessible datasets (e.g., MedQA, PathVQA) rather than live hospital environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A prospective study evaluating MAM's diagnostic accuracy and efficiency when integrated into actual clinical workflows alongside human practitioners.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can advanced knowledge retrieval mechanisms significantly improve the low recall rates (12.1%–34.0%) observed in the Medical Assistant module?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states future work will "integrate advanced knowledge retrieval," and Section 5.7 highlights that "imperfect recall" limits diagnostic performance.
- Why unresolved: The current reliance on Google API queries often fails to retrieve documents containing the correct answer, particularly for complex datasets like NIH Chest X-rays.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integration of specialized medical vector databases showing an increase in retrieval recall and a subsequent rise in "Answer Correct" accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What causes the performance degradation when increasing the number of agent roles beyond three, and how can this "inverted U-shape" trend be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Figure 3 and Section 5.6 show performance drops when expanding from 3 to 5 roles, hypothesizing "redundancy or overhead" without providing a definitive solution.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that excessive roles degrade performance, it does not determine the specific failure mode (e.g., conflicting reasoning vs. attention dilution).
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing the semantic consistency of agent outputs as the number of roles increases, identifying the point of information dilution.

## Limitations
- Clinical safety and error tolerance not extensively assessed, critical for medical applications
- Long-term maintenance burden and potential accumulation of inconsistencies across modules not detailed
- Performance comparison with specialized single-purpose medical AI systems not conducted
- Regulatory and deployment challenges in real-world clinical settings not addressed

## Confidence
- **High**: Claims about superior diagnostic performance and modular architecture benefits
- **Medium**: Claims about knowledge update efficiency and model integration flexibility
- **Low**: Claims about clinical applicability and safety

## Next Checks
1. Conduct long-term stability tests to assess how the modular architecture performs as individual components are updated over time, measuring for potential knowledge inconsistencies or performance degradation.

2. Perform extensive error analysis to identify failure modes, particularly in high-stakes diagnostic scenarios, and test the system's ability to flag uncertain cases for human review.

3. Compare MAM's performance against specialized medical AI systems on benchmark tasks to determine whether the multi-agent approach provides advantages over domain-specific solutions.
