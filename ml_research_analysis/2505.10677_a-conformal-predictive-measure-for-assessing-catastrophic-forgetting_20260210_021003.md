# A Conformal Predictive Measure for Assessing Catastrophic Forgetting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.10677
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10677
- Reference count: 18
- Introduces CPCF, a metric using conformal prediction to detect catastrophic forgetting in continual learning

## Executive Summary
This work introduces the Conformal Prediction Confidence Factor (CPCF), a novel metric for assessing catastrophic forgetting (CF) in continual learning. CPCF leverages conformal prediction to monitor model confidence on previously learned tasks by analyzing the average length of prediction sets. Shorter sets indicate higher confidence and better retention, while longer sets suggest increased uncertainty due to forgetting. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate a strong correlation between CPCF and the accuracy of previous tasks (aprev), with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.4996 to 0.8012 across different settings.

## Method Summary
The proposed method, CPCF, monitors catastrophic forgetting by leveraging conformal prediction to analyze prediction set lengths for previously learned tasks. As a model learns new tasks, its confidence on earlier tasks is measured through the average length of conformal prediction sets. Shorter prediction sets indicate higher confidence and better retention, while longer sets suggest increased uncertainty due to forgetting. CPCF is tested across various calibration ratios and significance levels, showing robustness and interpretability. The metric is validated on four image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, KMNIST, FashionMNIST) with and without Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), demonstrating consistent correlation with task accuracy.

## Key Results
- Strong correlation (0.4996 to 0.8012) between CPCF and previous task accuracy across benchmark datasets
- CPCF remains effective and interpretable under various calibration ratios and significance levels
- Consistent performance in both standard and EWC-regularized models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CPCF works by leveraging conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in continual learning. When a model encounters new tasks, conformal prediction generates prediction sets that contain the true label with a specified probability. The average length of these sets for previous tasks serves as a proxy for model confidence: shorter sets mean the model is confident and likely retaining past knowledge, while longer sets indicate increased uncertainty and potential forgetting. By tracking these set lengths over time, CPCF provides a continuous, uncertainty-aware measure of catastrophic forgetting.

## Foundational Learning
- Conformal prediction: Needed for generating calibrated prediction sets; check: understand how nonconformity scores are computed
- Catastrophic forgetting: Core problem being addressed; check: can you explain how it manifests in neural networks
- Continual learning: Context for applying CPCF; check: know the difference between replay and regularization approaches
- Prediction set length: Key metric in CPCF; check: why shorter sets indicate higher confidence
- Significance level: Controls calibration; check: how does changing it affect prediction set length
- Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC): Regularization baseline; check: what role does it play in mitigating forgetting

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Task -> Model Training -> Conformal Prediction on Previous Tasks -> Average Prediction Set Length Calculation -> CPCF Score

**Critical Path:**
1. Model processes new task data
2. Conformal predictor generates prediction sets for previous tasks
3. Average set length is computed
4. CPCF score reflects forgetting level

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Balances between computational overhead of conformal prediction and interpretability
- Choice of significance level affects sensitivity vs. stability
- Prediction set length as proxy for forgetting vs. direct accuracy measurement

**Failure Signatures:**
- CPCF fails to correlate with actual forgetting when tasks are highly dissimilar
- Prediction set lengths may not capture forgetting in multi-modal or imbalanced datasets
- Metric sensitivity to choice of nonconformity measure or conformal predictor

**First Experiments:**
1. Measure CPCF correlation with task accuracy after sequential learning on MNIST
2. Compare CPCF behavior in EWC vs. non-EWC models during task acquisition
3. Test CPCF stability across different calibration ratios (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) on CIFAR-10

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to small-scale image datasets; scalability to larger or non-vision domains untested
- Does not directly measure task performance or precision-recall trade-offs
- Method's sensitivity to choice of conformal predictor and significance level not fully explored
- Theoretical link between prediction set length and true forgetting is correlational, not causal

## Confidence
- Correlation with accuracy: High
- Stability across calibration ratios: High
- Interpretability and practicality: Medium
- Generalizability to complex datasets: Low
- Discriminative power vs. baselines: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test CPCF on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet, domain-specific image sets) and non-image modalities (e.g., text, audio) to assess scalability and robustness
2. Compare CPCF against established catastrophic forgetting metrics (e.g., forgetting rate, accuracy drop) on the same benchmarks to quantify relative sensitivity and specificity
3. Perform ablation studies to determine CPCF's sensitivity to the choice of conformal predictor, significance level, and task sequence structure, including scenarios with concept drift or imbalanced tasks
