- Introduces multi-hop reasoning framework reducing VLM hallucinations by 31.8% on landmark images

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical limitation of vision-language models (VLMs) hallucinating factual inaccuracies in image captions. The proposed solution implements a multi-hop reasoning framework that systematically verifies generated captions against structured knowledge graphs. By extracting visual entities, matching them to a curated knowledge base using both exact and fuzzy matching, and validating facts through three knowledge representation formats (triples, hierarchical trees, and bullet-point facts), the framework achieves significant improvements in factual accuracy while maintaining caption fluency.

The approach is evaluated on a curated dataset of landmark images, demonstrating a 31.8% reduction in hallucinated entities while preserving caption coherence scores between 4.1-4.3/5. The modular design enables interpretable reasoning paths and supports various verification tasks, making it particularly valuable for applications requiring high factual precision. The framework represents a significant advancement over traditional VLM caption generation by introducing verifiable, structured reasoning rather than relying solely on statistical pattern matching.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a multi-hop reasoning pipeline for VLM caption verification and correction. It uses Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct to generate base captions from landmark images, then applies spaCy NER to extract named entities by type (FAC, GPE, ORG). These entities are matched against a manually curated knowledge graph using exact matching and fuzzy matching via sentence embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) with a confidence threshold of 0.85. The framework validates relationships through three knowledge representation formats: triples for direct relationships, hierarchical trees for containment/spatial reasoning, and bullet-point facts for attribute lookup. A corrected caption is generated through prompt engineering that integrates verified facts while preserving fluency.

The evaluation uses a 100-image dataset partitioned into Seen Landmarks (60%), Unseen Landmarks (20%), and Distractor Scenes (20%), drawn from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual Captions, and COCO Captions. Metrics include Entity Accuracy, Fact Verification Rate, and Caption Coherence on a 1-5 human rating scale. The hierarchical representation achieves the highest accuracy (78.1%) while bullet-points maintain highest coherence (4.3/5).

## Key Results
- 31.8% reduction in hallucinated entities (55→38 on 100-image evaluation set)
- Hierarchical representation achieves highest Entity Accuracy (78.1%) and FVR (73.2%)
- Caption coherence maintained at 4.1-4.3/5 across formats
- Multi-format combination provides +27% hallucination reduction vs. triples alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Entity extraction from VLM captions followed by structured knowledge graph matching can identify hallucinated entities with measurable confidence. spaCy NER extracts named entities from the base caption; these are matched against a curated knowledge graph using exact matching and fuzzy matching via sentence embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). Entities below confidence threshold (<0.85) or absent from the KG are flagged as potential hallucinations. Core assumption: Hallucinated entities will not have valid correspondences in the domain-specific knowledge graph. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement" and [section 3] "Fuzzy matching uses sentence embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to identify the closest entity in G when exact matches fail." Break condition: If the knowledge graph has insufficient coverage for the domain, legitimate entities will be incorrectly flagged as hallucinations.

### Mechanism 2
Multiple knowledge representation formats (triples, hierarchical trees, bullet-point facts) provide complementary verification paths that improve robustness. Each format supports different reasoning types—triples for direct relationships, hierarchies for containment/spatial reasoning, bullet-points for quick attribute lookup. The framework can cross-validate across formats or use them in isolation. Core assumption: Different factual claims (spatial, relational, attribute-based) are better verified by structurally matched representations. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "evaluating the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations" and [section 4 Table 1] showing hierarchical achieves highest Entity Accuracy (78.1%). Break condition: If representations contain conflicting facts, the verification layer requires a resolution strategy not fully specified in this prototype.

### Mechanism 3
Post-hoc caption correction using verified facts preserves fluency while improving factual accuracy. After verification, a corrected caption is generated by integrating verified facts with the original caption structure via prompt engineering. The VLM (Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) is re-prompted with corrected entity context. Core assumption: The VLM can incorporate external facts into its generation without degrading linguistic quality. Evidence anchors: [section 3] "The correction process uses prompt engineering to preserve proper context and coherence" and [section 4] reporting 31.8% reduction in hallucinated entities while maintaining caption coherence scores 4.1-4.3/5. Break condition: Aggressive correction may over-constrain generation, producing technically accurate but unnatural captions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Construction (entities, relations, edges, traversal)
  - Why needed here: The framework depends on a manually curated KG with defined entity types (FAC, GPE, ORG) and relation categories (spatial, structural, attribute).
  - Quick check question: Can you diagram a 3-hop reasoning path from a landmark entity to its country through the KG?

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation
  - Why needed here: The entity extraction hop uses spaCy NER to identify candidate entities; understanding confidence thresholds and entity types is critical for debugging matching failures.
  - Quick check question: What happens when spaCy extracts "UNESCO World Heritage Site" as an ORG but your KG represents it as an attribute?

- Concept: Sentence Embeddings and Similarity Thresholds
  - Why needed here: Fuzzy matching relies on embedding similarity with a 0.85 threshold; tuning this directly affects precision/recall of hallucination detection.
  - Quick check question: If fuzzy matching returns a 0.82 similarity score for a correct entity, should you lower the threshold or expand the KG?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Base Caption → Entity List → KG Matches → Verification Report → Corrected Caption
- Critical path: The entity extraction and KG matching stages are the primary failure points; verification quality is bounded by KG coverage.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hierarchical representation: Best accuracy (78.1%) but may constrain free-form generation
  - Bullet-points: Highest coherence but limited reasoning depth
  - Triples: Balanced but insufficient for complex spatial/containment reasoning alone
  - Multi-format combination: +27% hallucination reduction vs. triples alone (Section 3.1.3), but increased complexity
- Failure signatures:
  - Low entity match rate → KG coverage gap or NER extraction errors
  - High coherence drop after correction → over-constrained prompts
  - False positive hallucinations → threshold too aggressive or entity type mismatch
  - Unchanged hallucination rate → verification logic not triggering corrections
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline calibration: Run 20 images through the pipeline without correction to measure baseline hallucination rate and entity extraction coverage on your domain.
  2. Ablation by representation: Compare triples-only vs. hierarchical vs. bullet-points on a held-out set to identify which format best matches your entity types.
  3. Threshold sensitivity: Vary fuzzy match threshold (0.75, 0.85, 0.95) and plot precision vs. recall for hallucination detection to find operating point for your error tolerance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the multi-hop reasoning framework perform when applied to vision-language model architectures other than the Qwen family (e.g., LLaVA, GPT-4o)?
- Can the framework maintain high factual verification accuracy when transitioning from a manually curated knowledge graph to large-scale, dynamic knowledge sources?
- Can the trade-off between factual strictness and caption fluency be optimized, specifically regarding the loss of coherence observed in hierarchical verification?

## Limitations
- Framework depends on manually curated, domain-specific knowledge graph with limited coverage details
- Prompt templates for caption correction stage are not provided
- Exact dataset curation and ground truth annotation procedures remain unclear

## Confidence
- High confidence in Entity Accuracy (78.1%) and FVR (73.2%) results with hierarchical representation
- Medium confidence in 31.8% hallucination reduction claim based on single 100-image evaluation set
- Low confidence in caption coherence maintenance (4.1-4.3/5) across all formats due to lack of statistical testing

## Next Checks
1. Knowledge graph coverage analysis: Measure entity match success rates per dataset split to quantify how coverage gaps affect hallucination detection precision.
2. Cross-format hallucination detection comparison: Run the same 50 images through all three knowledge representations and compare false positive rates to identify which format minimizes over-flagging of legitimate entities.
3. Inter-annotator agreement study: Have two annotators independently evaluate caption coherence and hallucination presence on a 20-image subset to establish reliability of subjective metrics.
