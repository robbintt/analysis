# Agentic AI: A Comprehensive Survey of Architectures, Applications, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25445
- Authors: Mohamad Abou Ali; Fadi Dornaika
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces dual-paradigm framework for Agentic AI systems, distinguishing Symbolic/Classical and Neural/Generative lineages through PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018–2025)

## Executive Summary
This survey addresses the conceptual confusion in Agentic AI by introducing a dual-paradigm framework that categorizes systems into Symbolic/Classical (algorithmic planning, persistent state) and Neural/Generative (stochastic generation, prompt-driven orchestration) lineages. Through systematic analysis of 90 studies, the authors reveal a clear paradigm-market fit where symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains while neural systems thrive in adaptive environments. The research identifies a significant governance imbalance, with extensive study of ethical challenges in neural paradigms but underexplored governance for modern symbolic systems. The authors propose hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures as the most promising future direction for creating systems that balance adaptability with reliability.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a PRISMA-based systematic review of 90 studies published between 2018 and 2025, analyzing theoretical foundations, architectural frameworks, domain applications, and governance challenges across both paradigms. The review methodology employed structured screening criteria to ensure comprehensive coverage of Agentic AI literature. Through systematic categorization, the researchers identified patterns in domain applications, governance approaches, and architectural characteristics, enabling the development of their dual-paradigm framework. The analysis focused on distinguishing between algorithmic planning approaches and stochastic generation methods while examining their respective governance implications.

## Key Results
- Introduces dual-paradigm framework distinguishing Symbolic/Classical (algorithmic planning, persistent state) from Neural/Generative (stochastic generation, prompt-driven orchestration) lineages
- Identifies clear market fit: symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains like healthcare and robotics, while neural systems thrive in adaptive, data-rich environments like finance and education
- Reveals significant governance imbalance, with extensive ethical challenges studied in neural paradigms but modern symbolic governance underexplored
- Proposes hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures as most promising future direction for balancing adaptability and reliability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-paradigm framework works by providing a structured lens for understanding the fundamental differences between algorithmic planning approaches and stochastic generation methods in Agentic AI systems. By categorizing systems based on their core mechanisms—persistent state management and deterministic planning versus probabilistic generation and prompt orchestration—the framework enables systematic analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate application domains. This mechanistic understanding allows researchers and practitioners to match system architectures with domain requirements, explaining why safety-critical applications favor symbolic approaches while adaptive environments benefit from neural methods.

- **Dual-paradigm classification**: Why needed - provides clear framework for understanding fundamental differences between Agentic AI approaches; Quick check - test classification against emerging hybrid systems
- **Symbolic planning mechanisms**: Why needed - foundational understanding of algorithmic decision-making in AI systems; Quick check - verify state-space representation and planning algorithms
- **Neural stochastic generation**: Why needed - understanding probabilistic approaches to agent behavior and decision-making; Quick check - examine prompt engineering and temperature settings
- **Governance framework analysis**: Why needed - identifies critical gaps in ethical and safety considerations across paradigms; Quick check - assess completeness of governance coverage
- **Domain-paradigm market fit**: Why needed - guides appropriate system selection based on application requirements; Quick check - validate domain-paradigm correlations with empirical data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Symbolic Layer -> Planning Engine -> State Manager -> Execution Interface
Neural Layer -> Generation Module -> Prompt Orchestrator -> Action Selector

**Critical Path**
State assessment → Planning/Generation decision → Action formulation → Execution monitoring → State update

**Design Tradeoffs**
Deterministic vs. probabilistic behavior, interpretability vs. adaptability, computational efficiency vs. decision quality, safety vs. innovation potential

**Failure Signatures**
Symbolic: State explosion, planning deadlocks, brittle rule systems
Neural: Hallucination, prompt injection, inconsistent behavior, lack of transparency

**First Experiments**
1. Compare planning horizon effectiveness between symbolic and neural approaches in simulated environments
2. Test governance framework completeness by attempting to identify unstudied ethical challenges
3. Evaluate hybrid system performance in safety-critical domain scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions, primarily centered on the development and evaluation of hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. Key questions include: How can we effectively integrate the reliability of symbolic planning with the adaptability of neural generation? What governance frameworks are needed for modern symbolic systems that haven't been adequately studied? How can we measure and compare the safety and ethical implications across different paradigms? The paper also questions whether the current dual-paradigm framework will remain relevant as hybrid approaches become more sophisticated, and how to evaluate the market fit of emerging architectural innovations.

## Limitations
- The PRISMA-based review methodology may have introduced selection bias despite claims of comprehensiveness
- The binary distinction between Symbolic/Classical and Neural/Generative paradigms may not capture emerging hybrid approaches or nuanced architectural variations
- Domain-paradigm market fit analysis is based on observed patterns rather than controlled empirical studies

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- Dual-paradigm framework validity: High
- Domain-paradigm market fit analysis: Medium
- Governance gap identification: Medium
- Hybrid architecture promise: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic comparison of governance frameworks across both paradigms using standardized evaluation criteria
2. Perform controlled experiments comparing hybrid neuro-symbolic systems against pure paradigm implementations in safety-critical domains
3. Expand literature review to include foundational works predating 2018 to validate the completeness of the dual-paradigm classification
