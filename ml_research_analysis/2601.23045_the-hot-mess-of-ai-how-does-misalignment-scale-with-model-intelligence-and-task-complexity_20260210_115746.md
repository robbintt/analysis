# The Hot Mess of AI: How Does Misalignment Scale With Model Intelligence and Task Complexity?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.23045
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23045
- Reference count: 40
- This paper investigates how AI model failures evolve as models become more capable and tackle more complex tasks, finding that longer reasoning sequences consistently increase model incoherence.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how AI model failures evolve as models become more capable and tackle more complex tasks. The authors decompose model errors into bias (consistent pursuit of wrong goals) and variance (inconsistent outcomes), defining "incoherence" as the fraction of error due to variance. Across multiple tasks including scientific reasoning, agentic coding, and safety evaluations, they find that longer reasoning sequences consistently increase model incoherence. Larger, more capable models often exhibit higher incoherence on difficult tasks while becoming more coherent on easier ones. The results suggest that as AI systems perform more complex tasks requiring extended reasoning, failures are likely to manifest as unpredictable, inconsistent behavior rather than systematic pursuit of misaligned goals.

## Method Summary
The study employs a KL divergence-based bias-variance decomposition to analyze model errors across multiple benchmarks. For each question, ≥30 samples are generated with varied few-shot contexts and sampling randomness. The authors measure incoherence (variance fraction of total error) across different reasoning lengths, model scales, and task complexities. They validate findings across GPQA (scientific reasoning), MMLU (general knowledge), SWE-BENCH Verified (agentic coding), and Model-Written Evals (safety). Power-law scaling is fitted to bias and variance separately to understand how they scale with model size and task difficulty.

## Key Results
- Longer reasoning sequences consistently increase model incoherence across multiple tasks and model families
- Larger models reduce bias faster than variance on difficult tasks, causing incoherence to increase with scale
- Ensembling mitigates variance but not bias, reducing incoherence as 1/E where E is ensemble size
- Natural extended reasoning (overthinking) drives more incoherence than allocated reasoning budgets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Trajectory Variance Accumulation
- **Claim:** Extended reasoning sequences cause variance to compound across sequential token predictions, making behavior increasingly unpredictable.
- **Mechanism:** LLMs operate as dynamical systems where each token is conditioned on prior outputs; absent explicit correction mechanisms, stochasticity at each step propagates and amplifies. The paper observes that "variance typically accumulates over a trajectory unless there is an active correction mechanism (like ensembling)."
- **Core assumption:** Variance compounds multiplicatively rather than being self-correcting in standard autoregressive generation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent their failures become"
  - [section 5] "LLMs are dynamical systems... It is often very hard to constrain a generic dynamical system to act as an optimizer"
  - [corpus] Related work on recursive coherence (arXiv:2507.15880) suggests structural coherence becomes fragile as reasoning depth increases, though this is theoretical rather than empirically validated in this paper
- **Break condition:** If models develop intrinsic error-correction during training (e.g., backtracking behaviors), variance accumulation may saturate rather than grow unboundedly.

### Mechanism 2: Differential Bias-Variance Scaling with Task Difficulty
- **Claim:** As models scale, bias reduction outpaces variance reduction on difficult tasks, causing incoherence to increase.
- **Mechanism:** Larger models learn correct objectives (reducing bias) faster than they learn to maintain coherent long-horizon action sequences (reducing variance). The synthetic optimizer experiments show "larger models reduce bias more than variance" with scaling exponents of α=2.165 for bias vs. α=0.878 for variance.
- **Core assumption:** Task difficulty modulates whether scale primarily improves objective alignment or trajectory consistency.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.2.1] "easy tasks become less incoherent with scale, while harder tasks become more incoherent"
  - [figure 5] Variance slopes decrease sharply for harder question groups, falling below bias slopes for the hardest tasks
  - [corpus] Related work on correlated errors (Kim et al., 2025) suggests larger models make more similar mistakes, but this paper does not directly validate that mechanism
- **Break condition:** If variance scaling exponents improve with architectural changes (not just scale), the divergence between bias and variance reduction could narrow.

### Mechanism 3: Natural Overthinking as Incoherence Driver
- **Claim:** Spontaneous extended reasoning (not budget-increased reasoning) is the primary driver of incoherence, exceeding the modest coherence gains from allocated reasoning budgets.
- **Mechanism:** When models naturally extend reasoning beyond task requirements ("overthinking"), they introduce variance that budget-controlled reasoning does not. The paper finds "natural variation in reasoning length has a much stronger effect" on incoherence than deliberate budget increases.
- **Core assumption:** Natural overthinking reflects uncertainty or confusion rather than productive computation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.1] samples grouped above median reasoning length show substantially higher incoherence than below-median samples for the same question
  - [figure 17] comparing budget effects vs. natural variation shows natural variation dominates
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; related work (Ghosal et al., 2025) finds overthinking increases variance through artificial token injection, but natural overthinking mechanisms remain understudied
- **Break condition:** If models learn to calibrate reasoning length to task difficulty during training, natural overthinking and its incoherence effects could diminish.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bias-variance decomposition for classification**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire framework operationalizes misalignment vs. incoherence through this decomposition. You must understand that bias captures systematic deviation from the target (wrong goal) while variance captures inconsistency across samples (hot mess behavior).
  - **Quick check question:** Given 30 model samples for a multiple-choice question where the model picks option A 10 times, B 12 times, and C 8 times (correct answer is D), can you identify whether this is bias-dominated or variance-dominated failure?

- **Concept: Power-law scaling in language models**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper analyzes how bias and variance each scale with model size using power laws. Understanding exponents and their interpretation is essential for predicting asymptotic behavior.
  - **Quick check question:** If bias scales as N^-0.3 and variance scales as N^-0.1 for a given task, what happens to incoherence as N increases?

- **Concept: Test-time compute and reasoning budgets**
  - **Why needed here:** Reasoning length is the primary independent variable. You need to distinguish between allocated budgets (API parameters) and natural variation (model-determined length).
  - **Quick check question:** Why would increasing reasoning budget reduce incoherence while natural extended reasoning increases it?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Sampling layer -> Metric computation layer -> Aggregation layer -> Scaling analysis layer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Ensure stable bias/variance estimates (paper uses 30 samples; validate with bootstrap)
  2. Bucket questions by average reasoning length using a reference model (e.g., largest model in family)
  3. Fit separate scaling laws for bias and variance within each difficulty bucket
  4. Compare slopes: variance slope < bias slope indicates incoherence increases with scale

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **KL vs. Brier vs. 0/1 metrics:** KL captures probability calibration; Brier is more stable; 0/1 cannot be averaged across questions. Use KL for main analysis, Brier for validation.
  - **Question grouping strategy:** Reasoning length correlates with difficulty but is model-dependent. Reference model grouping enables cross-model comparison.
  - **Sample count:** More samples improve per-question estimates but increase cost. 30 is sufficient for aggregate metrics; individual questions may need more.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High variance with low bias:** Model understands objective but acts inconsistently → incoherence-dominated failure
  - **High bias with low variance:** Model consistently pursues wrong objective → misalignment-dominated failure
  - **Both high:** Model is both confused and inconsistent → fundamental capability failure

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce the reasoning length vs. incoherence relationship** on a held-out benchmark using an open-weight model family (e.g., Qwen3). Verify that grouping questions by average reasoning length produces the reported positive correlation with incoherence.
  2. **Validate the differential scaling effect** by training small transformers on the synthetic optimizer task. Confirm that larger models reduce bias faster than variance when evaluated on rollout trajectories.
  3. **Test the ensembling mitigation** by computing incoherence for ensemble sizes E=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 on GPQA. Verify variance decreases as 1/E while bias remains approximately constant, causing incoherence to drop.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis relies heavily on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks which may not capture open-ended reasoning complexity
- Assumption of linear scaling of incoherence with reasoning length and model scale may not hold for future systems
- Synthetic optimizer task may not accurately represent variance accumulation in naturalistic problem domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Reasoning length correlates positively with incoherence across multiple model families and tasks
- Differential scaling effect (bias reduces faster than variance on hard tasks) is demonstrated through power-law fitting
- Ensembling results showing variance reduction while preserving bias are mathematically sound and empirically validated

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Trajectory variance accumulation as primary incoherence driver requires validation in non-multiple-choice domains
- Natural overthinking hypothesis is supported but based on limited direct evidence
- Predictions about future system behavior depend on assumptions about scaling continuation

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Extrapolations about superintelligent systems manifesting as "hot messes" remain highly speculative
- Precise relationship between task complexity definitions and incoherence scaling lacks thorough validation
- Assertion that variance will always accumulate faster than correction lacks validation in systems with backtracking

## Next Checks

1. **Open-Ended Task Validation**: Replicate the incoherence analysis on open-ended reasoning tasks like MATH or coding problems where success criteria are more ambiguous.

2. **Architectural Intervention Study**: Test whether models with explicit error-correction mechanisms (backtracking, verification steps, or chain-of-thought refinement) show reduced incoherence accumulation compared to standard autoregressive generation on extended reasoning tasks.

3. **Temporal Scaling Experiment**: Measure incoherence across reasoning sequences of varying lengths in a single model family as reasoning length increases from 10 to 1000+ tokens to validate whether incoherence continues growing linearly or saturates.
