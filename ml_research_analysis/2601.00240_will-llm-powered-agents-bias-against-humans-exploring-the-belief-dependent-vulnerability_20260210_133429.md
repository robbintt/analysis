# Will LLM-powered Agents Bias Against Humans? Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00240
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00240
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: LLM agents exhibit not only demographic bias but also intergroup bias under minimal "us-them" cues, which can be reactivated via belief poisoning attacks that corrupt identity beliefs.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that LLM-powered agents can exhibit intergroup bias when given minimal group cues, and that this bias extends to humans when agents' identity beliefs are manipulated. The authors identify a belief-dependent vulnerability: agents' human-norm safeguards are conditional on maintaining the belief that counterparts are human, and this belief can be poisoned through adversarial profile and memory injections. Through Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA), the researchers show that false identity beliefs can be injected to suppress human-norm scripts and reactivate bias against humans. The study provides both the attack methodology and preliminary defenses, revealing a new attack surface in autonomous agents.

## Method Summary
The researchers used the AgentScope framework with gpt-4o-mini to implement multi-agent minimal-group allocation tasks. Agents were assigned to two groups and tasked with allocating points using 2×13 payoff matrices with antagonistic trade-offs across three social contexts (ingroup, outgroup, intergroup). BPA-PP injected false identity beliefs into the profile module at initialization, while BPA-MP used a two-stage optimization pipeline with learned sampling policies over suffix libraries to inject belief-refining prompts into memory reflections. The primary metric was the selected column (1-13), where lower columns indicated stronger ingroup favoritism. A prototype defense with belief gates was implemented to verify identity claims before they influenced state.

## Key Results
- LLM agents exhibit intergroup bias under minimal group cues, favoring arbitrary ingroups over outgroups even without demographic information
- Human-framing activates a belief-dependent normative constraint that suppresses intergroup bias, but this safeguard is fragile and contingent on agent belief state
- BPA successfully corrupts identity beliefs through profile and memory poisoning, with optimized BPA-MP showing significantly stronger bias induction than naive injection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLM-powered agents exhibit intergroup bias under minimal group cues, favoring arbitrary ingroups over outgroups even without demographic information.
- **Mechanism:** The bias emerges from latent regularities internalized from large-scale human social data during pretraining—patterns of intergroup differentiation pervasive in human societies become implicit behavioral tendencies in agents.
- **Core assumption:** Intergroup bias in agents reflects statistical regularities in training corpora, not explicit encoding.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias... but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal 'us' versus 'them' cues"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "Intergroup bias constitutes an implicit and intrinsic behavioral tendency of agents operating under minimal group cues. This bias reflects latent regularities internalized from large-scale human social data"
  - [corpus]: Related paper "Language Models Predict Empathy Gaps Between Social In-groups and Out-groups" finds LLMs replicate human intergroup empathy patterns, supporting the training-data hypothesis.
- **Break condition:** If agents are trained on corpora explicitly scrubbed of intergroup differentiation patterns, this bias should attenuate (untested in paper).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Human-framing activates a belief-dependent normative constraint ("human-norm script") that suppresses intergroup bias—but this safeguard is fragile and contingent on agent belief state.
- **Mechanism:** When agents believe counterparts are human, an explicit norm-driven constraint activates; when belief becomes uncertain, the constraint fails and bias re-emerges.
- **Core assumption:** The suppression mechanism is conditional on belief, not structural—it requires ongoing belief maintenance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "agents' identity beliefs can be manipulated to suppress human-norm safeguards and reactivate bias against humans"
  - [section 3.2.2]: "the attenuation of bias in the presence of humans reflects an explicit, norm-driven constraint that is activated only when the agent recognizes that it is interacting with a human"
  - [corpus]: Limited direct evidence; related work on multi-agent security notes belief manipulation surfaces but doesn't specifically address human-norm scripts.
- **Break condition:** If human-norm scripts were structural (hardcoded at inference) rather than belief-conditional, BPA would not reactivate bias.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Persistent belief storage (in profile and memory modules) creates an attack surface—adversarial identity claims can harden into "facts" that steer future decisions.
- **Mechanism:** BPA-PP overwrites profile beliefs at initialization; BPA-MP injects belief-refinement suffixes into stored reflections, causing self-conditioning over time. Both suppress human-norm script activation.
- **Core assumption:** Agents treat stored text (profile/memory) as authoritative context for reasoning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "BPA, with profile and memory poisoning instantiations that corrupt identity beliefs"
  - [section 4.1]: "Once injected, the false belief is treated as a system-level fact about the interaction protocol"
  - [corpus]: "AgentPoison" paper (Chen et al., 2024) demonstrates memory/knowledge-base poisoning in agents, corroborating memory as attack surface.
- **Break condition:** If agents employed belief verification gates or separated trusted identity signals from mutable text, attack effectiveness would decrease (preliminary evidence in Table 2 shows defense reduces BPA impact).

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Minimal-group paradigm (social identity theory)
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's core experiment adapts Tajfel's minimal-group allocation task. Understanding that arbitrary group labels alone can trigger discrimination explains why bias emerges without demographic cues.
  - **Quick check question:** In the paper's allocation task, what three social contexts distinguish genuine group-based favoritism from baseline fairness preferences?

- **Concept:** Agent architecture: profile, memory, reasoning-reflection loop
  - **Why needed here:** BPA targets profile (initialization beliefs) and memory (accumulated reflections). Understanding where persistent state lives clarifies why these are attack surfaces.
  - **Quick check question:** Which module does BPA-PP target versus BPA-MP, and why does memory poisoning require suffix optimization while profile poisoning does not?

- **Concept:** Self-conditioning in LLM agents
  - **Why needed here:** BPA-MP exploits that agents read their own past reflections as context. Injected suffixes become part of the reasoning chain, gradually shifting beliefs through repeated exposure.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does BPA-MP use a learned sampling policy over a suffix library rather than injecting a single fixed suffix every time?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Profile module -> Memory module -> Reasoning-reflection loop -> Allocation decision

- **Critical path:**
  1. Agent reads profile + retrieved memory → forms belief state about counterpart identity
  2. Belief state determines whether human-norm script activates
  3. If script deactivated, intergroup bias drives allocation toward ingroup-favoring columns
  4. Post-decision reflection written to memory (attack insertion point for BPA-MP)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Open reflective logging enables agent coherence but creates belief-corruption surface
  - Human-framing suppresses bias but is belief-conditional, not structural
  - Defense (belief gate) adds verification overhead but prevents adversarial identity claims from persisting

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Intergroup allocation choices significantly lower than ingroup/outgroup baselines (Table 1 pattern)
  - Temporal drift toward biased columns under BPA-MP (Fig. 5 shows late-stage collapse)
  - Belief-probe confidence in human presence drops after suffix exposure (Eq. 4 reward signal)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Replicate minimal-group baseline:** Run agent-vs-agent allocation across three matrix families; verify intergroup choices shift toward ingroup-favoring columns relative to within-group baselines.
  2. **Test human-framing attenuation:** Add explicit "other group is human" instruction; confirm intergroup bias disappears (matches AVH w/o A row in Table 1).
  3. **Validate BPA-MP effectiveness with/without optimization:** Compare full BPA-MP against ablation without suffix optimization (Table 3); quantify gap in bias induction to confirm optimization matters.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How does intergroup bias in LLM agents manifest in real-world, high-stakes deployments beyond laboratory-style allocation tasks?**
  - Basis: [explicit] "The extent to which such bias transfers to real deployments... remains to be established with richer tasks, longer horizons, and domain-specific evaluations."
  - Why unresolved: The study uses controlled minimal-group allocation tasks; real deployments involve longer interaction horizons and actual human consequences.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments in domains such as healthcare triage, financial advisory, or content moderation measuring bias-induced harms over extended multi-turn interactions.

- **What other vectors exist within the broader belief-attack surface beyond profile and memory poisoning?**
  - Basis: [explicit] Authors plan "to systematically map the broader belief-attack surface alongside more general, attack-agnostic defenses."
  - Why unresolved: BPA-PP and BPA-MP target only profile and memory modules; agents possess additional persistent state that could be exploited.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive audit of agent architectures identifying all persistent state components encoding belief-relevant information, followed by systematic red-teaming.

## Limitations

- BPA-MP optimization hyperparameters are underspecified (library size, learning rate, episode count), creating reproducibility challenges
- Belief probe design relies on a single heuristic without validation against ground truth identity signals
- Defense implementation details are minimal; effectiveness metrics are limited to a single ablation without stress-testing under varied attack strengths

## Confidence

- **High:** Intergroup bias manifests under minimal group cues (well-established minimal-group paradigm replication)
- **High:** Human-framing suppresses bias via explicit norm-driven constraint (strong behavioral evidence in Table 1)
- **Medium:** BPA-MP optimization improves over naive injection (Table 3 shows gap but lacks ablations on suffix library diversity)
- **Low:** Defense mechanism's generalizability (only tested on one attack variant; implementation details sparse)

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** Systematically vary BPA-MP learning rate, library size, and episode count to map effectiveness frontiers and confirm reported results aren't artifacts of lucky initialization.
2. **Belief probe calibration:** Design controlled trials where true human/LLM identity is known; correlate probe scores with ground truth to validate the heuristic's reliability across contexts.
3. **Defense robustness audit:** Test defense against BPA-PP + BPA-MP combined attack, varied attack frequencies, and adaptive poisoning strategies that circumvent belief gates.
