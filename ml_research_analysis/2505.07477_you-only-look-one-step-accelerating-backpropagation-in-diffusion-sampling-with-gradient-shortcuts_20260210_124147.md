# You Only Look One Step: Accelerating Backpropagation in Diffusion Sampling with Gradient Shortcuts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.07477
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07477
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SDO reduces memory and computational costs by ~90% while maintaining or improving performance across diverse tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Shortcut Diffusion Optimization (SDO), a method to accelerate backpropagation during diffusion sampling by retaining only one computational step instead of the full generation chain. The authors demonstrate that using Picard iteration in parallel denoising allows gradients to be computed efficiently, reducing memory and computational costs by approximately 90% while maintaining or improving performance. Experiments across various tasks—such as text-guided image manipulation, style-guided generation, aesthetic enhancement, adversarial sample generation, and reward-based fine-tuning—show that SDO outperforms traditional full backpropagation methods and is broadly applicable to different diffusion frameworks and solvers.

## Method Summary
SDO leverages the structural properties of Picard iteration to provide a shortcut for gradient propagation, enabling efficient optimization of all parameter types in diffusion models. Instead of backpropagating through the entire generation chain, SDO uses a single computational step with parallel denoising to compute gradients. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and computational overhead while maintaining or improving performance across various tasks and diffusion model architectures.

## Key Results
- Achieves ~90% reduction in memory and computational costs compared to traditional backpropagation methods
- Maintains or improves performance across diverse tasks including text-guided manipulation, style transfer, and adversarial generation
- Demonstrates broad applicability across different diffusion frameworks and solvers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SDO exploits the mathematical properties of Picard iteration in diffusion sampling, which allows for efficient gradient computation without needing to backpropagate through the entire generation chain. By using parallel denoising in a single step, the method bypasses the computational bottleneck of traditional backpropagation while preserving the essential information needed for optimization.

None

## Limitations
- Computational speedup claims may vary across different model architectures and tasks
- Reliance on Picard iteration may limit applicability to diffusion models using different iterative schemes
- Potential quality trade-offs in high-resolution or long-horizon generation tasks remain unverified

## Confidence
- Computational efficiency gains: High - Strong theoretical foundation and experimental support
- Generalizability across tasks: Medium - Promising results across multiple domains, but broader testing needed
- Preservation of output quality: Medium - Maintained performance in tested scenarios, but edge cases unverified

## Next Checks
1. Test SDO on diffusion models with varying step counts (e.g., 10 vs. 1000 steps) to quantify how speedup scales with generation length
2. Evaluate SDO's performance on high-resolution image generation (e.g., 1024x1024) to assess quality retention in demanding scenarios
3. Apply SDO to conditional generation tasks requiring fine-grained spatial control (e.g., inpainting with complex masks) to verify its effectiveness in precision-critical applications
