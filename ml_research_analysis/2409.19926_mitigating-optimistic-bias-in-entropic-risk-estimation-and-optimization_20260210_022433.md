# Mitigating optimistic bias in entropic risk estimation and optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.19926
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19926
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes a parametric bootstrap procedure to correct the negative bias in empirical entropic risk estimation, improving decision-making in distributionally robust optimization for insurance pricing.

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of mitigating the negative bias in empirical entropic risk estimation, which is particularly problematic for high-stakes decision-making involving tail risks. Existing bias correction methods either underestimate or overestimate the risk, leading to suboptimal decisions. The authors propose a parametric bootstrap procedure that fits a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the data and estimates the bias through bootstrapping, ensuring controlled overestimation while maintaining asymptotic consistency. The method is applied to a distributionally robust optimization model for insurance contract design, demonstrating significant improvements in out-of-sample risk estimation compared to traditional cross-validation approaches. Specifically, the proposed method recommends more accurate premiums and better reflects the underlying tail risk.

## Method Summary
The method involves fitting a GMM to standardized loss data with constraints ensuring mean preservation, heavy right tail, and subgaussian standardized tails. Parametric bootstrap sampling from this fitted GMM estimates the empirical estimator's bias. This bias-corrected risk estimate is then used in a K-fold cross-validation loop to select the optimal ambiguity set radius for distributionally robust optimization. Three variants are proposed: BS-MLE (faster but potentially conservative), BS-Match (more accurate but computationally intensive), and BS-EVT (simplest for subgaussian losses).

## Key Results
- Empirical entropic risk systematically underestimates true entropic risk for limited data
- Proposed GMM-based parametric bootstrap produces controlled overestimation while maintaining asymptotic consistency
- Standard K-fold CV underestimates validation risk for DRO radius selection, leading to overly optimistic radius choices
- Out-of-sample entropic risk of insurer is significantly reduced using proposed bias correction methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Empirical entropic risk systematically underestimates true entropic risk when data is limited.
- **Mechanism**: The log function is strictly concave. By Jensen's inequality, E[log(sample average)] < log(E[sample average]) = true entropic risk. This negative bias grows superlinearly with loss variance for distributions with unbounded right tails.
- **Core assumption**: Losses have exponentially bounded tails (Assumption 1) and non-zero variance.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "empirical entropic risk estimator...underestimates true risk"
  - [Page 3, Equation 3]: Mathematical derivation of bias via Jensen's inequality
  - [Page 9, Proposition 2]: Bias = ω(√Var(ℓ)) for unbounded right tails
- **Break condition**: When variance is zero (deterministic loss), bias vanishes. For Laplace-distributed losses, bias becomes unbounded as Var(ℓ) → 2/α² (Proposition 4).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Parametric bootstrap with GMM fitting produces controlled overestimation while maintaining asymptotic consistency.
- **Mechanism**: Fit a GMM to standardized losses with constrained parameters ensuring: (1) mean preservation, (2) right tail at least as heavy as Gaussian, (3) subgaussian standardized tails. Bootstrap from this fitted distribution estimates the empirical estimator's bias. Properties 1-4 (affine equivariance, mean matching, heavy right tail, subgaussian tails) jointly guarantee overestimation grows linearly with variance (not exponentially).
- **Core assumption**: Losses have "lighter-than-Gaussian" tails (Definition 3) and fitted GMM satisfies boundedness conditions (Theorem 11).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Page 14-16, Theorem 10]: E[corrected estimator] - true risk = Ω(Var) but = O(Var)
  - [Page 16-17, Theorem 11]: GMM with bounded components satisfies required properties
  - [corpus]: Related work on EVT-based robustness for tail risk (arXiv:2506.16230) addresses similar bias but for different risk measures
- **Break condition**: MLE-fitted GMM may underestimate bias in finite samples even with large N (Figure 2); Laplace-tailed losses violate "lighter-than-Gaussian" assumption.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Standard K-fold CV underestimates validation risk for DRO radius selection, leading to overly optimistic radius choices.
- **Mechanism**: CV computes ρ(ρ(ℓ|validation data)) using tower property. By Jensen's inequality applied twice, this is strictly less than true risk of the policy trained on N(1-1/K) samples. This bias transfers to radius selection: CV chooses smaller ε* than optimal.
- **Core assumption**: Entropic risk satisfies tower property (unique among law-invariant convex risk measures).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [Page 24, Proposition 13]: Mathematical proof of CV underestimation
  - [Page 28-29, Figures 4-5]: CV selects lower ε* and achieves worse out-of-sample risk than proposed methods
  - [corpus]: Limited corpus evidence on CV bias in risk-sensitive settings; related work focuses on risk-averse MARL (arXiv:2509.24047) but not CV specifically
- **Break condition**: As K → N (leave-one-out), bias increases but variance may dominate; oracle radius tuning (using test data) removes bias but is infeasible in practice.

## Foundational Learning

- **Jensen's Inequality for Concave Functions**:
  - Why needed here: Core mathematical reason for negative bias; explains why log(E[X]) > E[log(X)]
  - Quick check question: If f is concave and X has variance σ² > 0, is E[f(X)] > f(E[X]), < f(E[X]), or = f(E[X])?

- **Entropic Risk Measure as Certainty Equivalent**:
  - Why needed here: Connects exponential utility to the specific risk measure being estimated; α controls risk aversion
  - Quick check question: For α → 0, what does the entropic risk approach?

- **Parametric vs Non-parametric Bootstrap**:
  - Why needed here: Distinguishes resampling from empirical distribution (fails here) vs from fitted parametric model (works)
  - Quick check question: Why might non-parametric bootstrap fail to estimate bias when the estimator itself is biased?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  [Loss Scenarios] → [Standardization] → [GMM Fitting with Constraints]
                           ↓
  [Bootstrap Sampling from GMM] → [Bias Estimation δN(QN)]
                           ↓
  [Empirical Risk + δN] → [DRO Radius Selection via Algorithm 5]
                           ↓
  [Distributionally Robust Optimization] → [Insurance Policy (z, π)]

- **Critical path**:
  1. Fit GMM with mean preservation (Property 2) and tail constraints (Properties 3-4)
  2. Compute bias correction via median of (ρ_Q - ρ_bootstrap) across M samples
  3. Integrate bias-corrected validation risk into CV loop for radius ε* selection
  4. Solve DRO problem (18) with selected ε*

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **BS-MLE**: Faster (standard EM), but may underestimate bias in finite samples
  - **BS-Match**: Better bias estimation, requires GPU and gradient-based optimization (Algorithm 4)
  - **BS-EVT**: Simplest deployment (semi-analytic two-component GMM), tailored to subgaussian losses
  - Tradeoff: Conservatism vs computational cost; BS-Match/BS-EVT recommended for production

- **Failure signatures**:
  1. **Continued underestimation**: Likely using MLE fitting or non-parametric bootstrap
  2. **Excessive overestimation**: GMM component variances not properly bounded, or losses heavier than subgaussian
  3. **Unstable bias estimates**: Insufficient bootstrap samples M, or poor GMM initialization
  4. **DRO divergence**: Radius ε* too large due to tail misspecification; check loss distribution assumptions

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline replication**: Reproduce Figure 3 with N=10,000; compare SAA, CV, BS-MLE, BS-Match, BS-EVT on 3-project portfolio; verify BS-Match/BS-EVT overestimate high-variance projects while CV/SAA underestimate
  2. **GMM component sensitivity**: Test J ∈ {2, 5, 10} components; measure bias correction accuracy vs computation time; check if J=2 (BS-EVT style) sufficient for subgaussian losses
  3. **Insurance pricing with correlation**: Implement full DRO model (Algorithm 5) with M=5 households, correlation r ∈ {0, 0.5, 0.75}; compare out-of-sample entropic risk of CV vs BS-Match radius selection; verify higher ε* leads to lower risk under correlation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can estimation procedures be developed that provably overestimate entropic risk for distributions with subgaussian tails while preserving tractability and controlled overestimation guarantees?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 8 ("Future Work") explicitly calls for procedures for subgaussian tails; [inferred] Theorem 10 currently guarantees overestimation only for "lighter-than-Gaussian" tails (q > 2).
- **Why unresolved**: The theoretical guarantees rely on the cumulant generating function growth rate for distributions strictly lighter than Gaussian (q > 2), leaving the standard Gaussian/subgaussian case (q=2) theoretically uncovered.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A modified fitting procedure or theoretical proof demonstrating that the estimator remains a conservative overestimator (satisfying Equations 9 and 10) for Gaussian-distributed losses.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can a fitting procedure be designed to provably overestimate entropic risk for distributions with heavier tails, such as the Laplace distribution, where the estimation bias becomes unbounded?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Section 4.2.3 discusses the difficulty of handling "exponentially bounded distributions" (e.g., Laplace) and notes Proposition 4 proves the bias can diverge, making it "nontrivial" for the current GMM approach.
- **Why unresolved**: The proposed GMM-based estimator bounds estimation error at most linearly in variance (O(Var)), which may fail to capture the unbounded negative bias of the empirical estimator for Laplace-like tails.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: A bias-aware distribution matching strategy using tails at least as heavy as the underlying distribution that provides valid overestimation guarantees in the Laplace regime.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can the bias correction procedures be adapted to reduce estimation bias for other convex risk measures, such as Optimized Certainty Equivalent (OCE) or utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR)?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Section 8 ("Future Work") identifies investigating the adaptation of these procedures to other convex risk measures as a future direction.
- **Why unresolved**: The current consistency and overestimation proofs rely on specific properties of the entropic risk measure (e.g., the tower property utilized in Proposition 13) which may not hold or differ for OCE or UBSR.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Derivation of analogous asymptotic consistency and overestimation bounds for OCE or UBSR estimators, followed by numerical validation of their out-of-sample performance.

## Limitations

- The proposed method assumes losses have "lighter-than-Gaussian" tails, which may not hold for many real-world heavy-tailed phenomena.
- The BS-Match approach requires gradient-based optimization with M=100 bootstrap samples and can require multiple iterations to converge, creating computational burden for large-scale applications.
- The method relies on GMM fitting to capture the true loss distribution, which may inadequately represent complex multimodal distributions.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The mathematical foundation showing empirical entropic risk underestimates true risk via Jensen's inequality (Mechanism 1). The theoretical bounds proving the proposed method provides controlled overestimation while maintaining consistency (Mechanism 2).

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of GMM-based bias correction in finite samples, particularly for BS-MLE which may underestimate bias. The assumption that K-fold CV systematically underestimates risk for DRO radius selection holds across diverse applications.

**Low Confidence**: The general applicability of the "lighter-than-Gaussian" tail assumption to real-world data. The claim that BS-Match/BS-EVT will consistently outperform other methods across all distributional scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. **Heavy-Tail Validation**: Test the method on simulated losses with known heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Pareto, t-distribution) to quantify performance degradation when the "lighter-than-Gaussian" assumption is violated.

2. **Scalability Benchmark**: Measure computational time for BS-Match as a function of (a) number of bootstrap samples M, (b) number of loss scenarios N, and (c) number of GMM components J. Identify practical limits for real-time applications.

3. **Cross-Application Test**: Apply the bias correction framework to a different domain (e.g., financial portfolio optimization or supply chain risk management) with different loss distributions to assess generalizability beyond the insurance setting.
