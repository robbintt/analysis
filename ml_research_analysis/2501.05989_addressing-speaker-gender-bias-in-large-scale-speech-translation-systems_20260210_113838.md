# Addressing speaker gender bias in large scale speech translation systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.05989
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05989
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 70% improvement in feminine speaker gender translation accuracy on MuST-SHE test set

## Executive Summary
This study addresses gender bias in large-scale speech translation systems that produce masculine translations by default even when the speaker is female. The authors propose a two-step approach: using GPT-4 to generate gender-debiased translations for a filtered subset of training data, then fine-tuning the ST model with this corrected data. The approach achieves 87.05% feminine GTA accuracy compared to 10% for baseline models. The paper also introduces a three-mode fine-tuned model that allows manual gender specification or automatic inference from audio cues.

## Method Summary
The method uses a streaming transformer transducer architecture with 18 encoder blocks, 2 LSTM prediction layers, and a joint network. The approach filters training data to utterances containing first-person pronouns (19.4% of data), reformulates these with GPT-4 using 10-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate masculine and feminine variants, then fine-tunes the ST model with mixed gender-debiased (1-θ_neut) and gender-neutral (θ_neut=0.2) data. A gender representation loss on encoder hidden states encourages the model to capture speaker gender from acoustic cues. The paper compares 1-mode (automatic) and 3-mode (manual override) fine-tuned models.

## Key Results
- 87.05% feminine GTA accuracy for 1-mode model vs 10% baseline on MuST-SHE
- 81.1% feminine GTA accuracy for 3-mode "Auto" mode vs 10% baseline
- 70% overall improvement in translations for female speakers
- GPT-4 reformulation achieves 94% accuracy on speaker gender forms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: LLM-Based Gender Form Rectification
GPT-4 with few-shot + chain-of-thought prompting can generate both masculine and feminine translation variants with ~94% accuracy on speaker gender forms. The LLM receives the source sentence, target translation, and instructions to rewrite only gender-marked segments in the specified form while preserving the rest. CoT prompting ensures the model reasons about which words require modification and avoids altering referent gender.

### Mechanism 2: Selective Data Filtering via First-Person Pronouns
Filtering training data to sentences containing first-person pronouns yields a high-recall subset for Category-1 gender bias while reducing GPT-4 reformulation cost by ~80%. English first-person pronouns are self-referential and likely to trigger gender-specific morphology in target languages.

### Mechanism 3: Gender Representation Loss on Encoder Hidden States
An auxiliary classification loss on encoder outputs encourages the model to capture speaker gender from acoustic cues, improving downstream gender-form selection. A linear classifier predicts gender from each encoder timestep's hidden representation, with gradients shaping encoder representations to encode gender-relevant acoustic features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer Transducer Architecture**: The base ST model uses streaming transformer transducer with 18 encoder blocks, 2 LSTM prediction network layers, and joint network. Understanding how audio features flow through encoder → joint network → output is essential for placing the GR loss correctly.
  - Quick check: Where does the gender representation loss attach—in the prediction network, joint network, or encoder? (Answer: Encoder hidden states)

- **Grammatical Gender Agreement**: Target languages like Spanish and Italian require gender agreement across adjectives, articles, and sometimes verbs. The model must propagate speaker gender through potentially distant dependent words, not just swap a single lexical item.
  - Quick check: In "I am happy" → Spanish, which words change based on speaker gender? (Answer: Both "am" and "happy" – "Estoy feliz" vs "Estoy feliz" [depends on specific lexical item])

- **Catastrophic Forgetting in Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning a large-scale model on a small debiased subset risks degrading general translation quality (BLEU). The θ_neut parameter controls mixing with gender-neutral data to preserve baseline capabilities.
  - Quick check: What happens to BLEU scores when θ_neut is set too low (<0.2)? (Answer: BLEU scores decline due to overfitting on the debiased subset)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Audio Input (80-dim log-Mel, 25ms window, 10ms shift)
       ↓
  Streaming Transformer Encoder (18 blocks, 320 hidden, 8 heads)
       ├─→ h^enc_t → [GR Loss Head: Linear → Softmax → Gender Prediction]
       ↓
  Joint Network (FFN, 512 × vocab_size)
       ↑
  Prediction Network (2 LSTM layers, 1024 hidden) ← Previous tokens
       ↓
  Output: Translation tokens
  ```

- **Critical path:**
  1. Filter training data for first-person pronouns → 19.4% subset
  2. Run GPT-4 reformulation with 10-shot + CoT prompt → generates (male, masc), (male, femi), (female, masc), (female, femi) variants
  3. Match variants to speaker gender labels → create debiased targets
  4. Fine-tune STBase with mixed debiased + neutral data, L_comb = 0.1×L_gr + 0.9×L_trans
  5. For 3-mode model: prepend <Lang_Mode> token (Mode ∈ {Masc, Femi, Auto})

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 1-mode vs 3-mode FT: 1-mode achieves higher Auto-mode accuracy (87.05% vs 81.1% feminine for ES) but cannot override based on user preference; 3-mode supports explicit gender selection at slight accuracy cost
  - θ_neut selection: Higher values (0.2+) reduce overfitting risk but dilute gender-specific signal; GR loss becomes more valuable at higher θ_neut
  - GPT-4 subset size: 2M utterances chosen as sufficient; full-dataset reformulation would increase cost without proportional accuracy gains

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Category-2 regression: If GPT-4 CoT prompt is poorly designed, referent gender may be incorrectly altered. Monitor Cat2-Acc on MuST-SHE
  - Low term coverage (<80%): Model avoids generating gender-marked words entirely; indicates insufficient exposure during fine-tuning or mode-token confusion
  - Masculine accuracy drop >5%: Over-correction toward feminine forms; rebalance gender proportions in debiased data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline probe: Run STBase on MuST-SHE dev set, measure Cat1 feminine GTA. Expected: <15%. Confirms masculine default bias
  2. Ablation on θ_neut: Fine-tune 1-mode FT with θ_neut ∈ {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}, plot GTA vs BLEU. Identify optimal tradeoff point before BLEU degradation
  3. GR loss contribution test: Train paired models (with/without L_gr) at θ_neut=0.2, compare Cat1 feminine GTA. Expected: GR loss provides 2-5% improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the proposed approach be extended to support non-binary speakers beyond the current binary manual overrides?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly states that future work involves "reducing bias for non-binary speakers."
- Why unresolved: The current 3-mode architecture supports only Masculine, Feminine, and Auto modes. The "Auto" mode relies on binary training labels (Male/Female) to infer gender from speech, leaving no mechanism for non-binary gender representation in the generated translations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the performance gap between the specialized 1-mode model and the flexible 3-mode model be bridged?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Table 2 shows the 3-mode "Auto" model achieves lower feminine accuracy (81.1%) than the 1-mode model (87.05%), which the authors attribute to the 3-mode model's "complex training process."
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the flexibility required to handle user-defined modes inherently degrades the model's ability to learn implicit gender cues from speech compared to a specialized, single-mode model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the reliance on GPT-4 for data reformulation introduce semantic drift or factual hallucinations in the training targets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.1.2 discusses using GPT-4 to rewrite translations, noting that without Chain-of-Thought prompting, it may incorrectly alter gender forms for referents.
- Why unresolved: While the paper verifies gender accuracy, it does not analyze if the LLM alters the semantic meaning of the original translation during the reformulation process, which could degrade the quality of the fine-tuned ST model.

## Limitations

- **GPT-4 prompt sensitivity**: The approach's success critically depends on the exact few-shot + CoT prompt for GPT-4, which is not provided in the paper
- **Data generalization**: The first-person pronoun filtering heuristic is validated only on the MuST-SHE dev set (ES/IT) and may not generalize across diverse speech domains or languages
- **Unreported hyperparameters**: Critical fine-tuning details (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, epochs, scheduler) are omitted, hindering exact replication

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism of using an LLM for gender form rectification and the existence of speaker gender bias in ST systems are well-supported. The 70% improvement claim is based on reported MuST-SHE results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the specific two-step approach (filtering + GPT-4 + fine-tuning) for the MuST-SHE dataset is supported, but generalization is uncertain. The choice of θ_neut=0.2 and α=0.1 is reasonable but not rigorously validated across all settings.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the first-person pronoun heuristic, the robustness of the approach to diverse languages/domains, and the long-term stability of fine-tuned models without further catastrophic forgetting are low-confidence areas.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on θ_neut**: Systematically vary θ_neut (e.g., 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) during fine-tuning and plot both GTA (especially feminine) and BLEU scores. Identify the exact point where BLEU begins to degrade and assess the tradeoff curve.

2. **GR Loss Ablation with Varying α**: Train paired models with and without the GR loss (α=0.0 vs α=0.1) at θ_neut=0.2. Measure the delta in feminine GTA and analyze if the improvement is consistent across different θ_neut values or only beneficial at higher θ_neut.

3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the full pipeline (filtering, GPT-4 reformulation, fine-tuning) to a different speech translation dataset (e.g., Fisher Spanish, Common Voice) or a different language pair (e.g., English→French). Measure GTA and BLEU to assess robustness beyond the MuST-SHE domain.
