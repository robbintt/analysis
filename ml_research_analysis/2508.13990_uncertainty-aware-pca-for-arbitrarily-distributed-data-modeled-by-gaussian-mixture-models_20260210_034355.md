# Uncertainty-Aware PCA for Arbitrarily Distributed Data Modeled by Gaussian Mixture Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.13990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13990
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes wGMM-UAPCA, extending uncertainty-aware PCA to project GMM-modeled distributions while preserving complex structure and allowing user-defined class weights.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of visualizing high-dimensional data with complex, non-normal uncertainty distributions by extending uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). The authors propose modeling each distribution as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and deriving a projection formula that directly projects arbitrary probability density functions through the UAPCA transformation. A key innovation is the incorporation of user-defined weights to emphasize certain distributions, which is particularly useful for handling class imbalance. The method, called wGMM-UAPCA, is evaluated quantitatively using Kullback-Leibler divergence and sliced Wasserstein distance on 17 real-world datasets, showing improved approximation of ground-truth distributions compared to standard UAPCA. Qualitative visualizations demonstrate better representation of multimodality and complex structures. An interactive system allows users to adjust class weights and immediately observe the effect on projections. The approach provides a flexible and accurate way to visualize complex uncertainty in reduced dimensions, with applications ranging from sample-based modeling to analytically defined distributions.

## Method Summary
The wGMM-UAPCA method extends uncertainty-aware PCA to handle arbitrarily distributed data by modeling each distribution as a Gaussian mixture model. The approach involves three main steps: (1) fitting GMMs to each class using expectation maximization with BIC-based component selection, (2) computing weighted aggregated moments from the GMM components, and (3) projecting the GMMs through the uncertainty-aware PCA transformation. The projection preserves the mixture structure by independently projecting each Gaussian component while maintaining mixture weights. User-defined importance weights allow emphasizing certain distributions in the projection. The method is evaluated on 17 real-world datasets using KL divergence and sliced Wasserstein distance metrics, with interactive visualizations demonstrating the effect of weight adjustments on projection quality.

## Key Results
- wGMM-UAPCA outperforms standard UAPCA on 12 of 17 datasets using KL divergence, with improvements ranging from 0.05% to 28.5%
- On 9 of 17 datasets, wGMM-UAPCA shows lower SW2 distance compared to UAPCA, with improvements between 0.7% and 22.1%
- Qualitative visualizations demonstrate better preservation of multimodality and complex structures, particularly visible in the hatespeech dataset where class weights can reveal hidden structure
- Interactive weight adjustment enables users to control projection basis orientation, emphasizing specific classes when needed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Projecting the full PDF via marginalization preserves distributional structure better than projecting only first and second moments.
- Mechanism: Given random vector X with PDF f_X(x) and orthogonal projection matrix U = [P | R] (projection P to d dimensions, residual R), the projected PDF is obtained by marginalizing over the orthogonal complement: f_Y(y) = ∫ f_X(Py + Rz) dz. For GMMs specifically, substituting the mixture PDF yields a closed-form result: each component N(μ_k, Σ_k) projects to N(P^T μ_k, P^T Σ_k P), preserving the mixture structure with identical weights.
- Core assumption: The high-dimensional distribution can be adequately represented by a GMM (or is exactly a GMM).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.1, Eq. 3] Derives the general marginalization formula for arbitrary PDFs.
  - [Section 4.2, Eq. 4] Shows the closed-form GMM projection preserves mixture weights and projects each component independently.
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak for this specific projection mechanism; related work on distributional neural networks (arXiv:2508.16686) addresses uncertainty quantification but not PDF projection through PCA.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aggregated GMM moments enable UAPCA to account for both within-component uncertainty and between-component dispersion when computing the projection basis.
- Mechanism: A GMM with K components is reduced to single aggregated mean μ̂ = Σ_k w_k μ_k and covariance Σ̂ = Σ_k w_k Σ_k + Σ_k w_k (μ_k - μ̂)(μ_k - μ̂)^T. The second term captures between-component variability that would be lost by simple averaging. These aggregated quantities feed into the UAPCA covariance formula Σ_UA = Σ_μ̂ + Σ̄ - C.
- Core assumption: A single projection basis can meaningfully serve all mixture components simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.2] Explicitly derives aggregated moments following Bishop's formulation.
  - [Section 3.3, Eq. 2] Original UAPCA covariance formula extended by weighted aggregated moments.
  - [corpus] Related work on robust PCA for non-Gaussian data (arXiv:2507.15232) addresses privacy/contamination but not moment aggregation for mixture models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: User-defined importance weights τ(i) control projection basis orientation by scaling each distribution's contribution to the covariance matrix.
- Mechanism: Weights τ(i) are incorporated into weighted mean μ̄ = Σ_i τ(i) μ̂^(i), weighted covariance Σ̄ = Σ_i τ(i) Σ̂^(i), and mean outer product Σ_μ̂ = Σ_i τ(i) μ̂^(i) μ̂^(i)^T before computing Σ_UA. Setting one τ(i) high rotates eigenvectors to explain variance in that distribution's direction.
- Core assumption: Domain knowledge or sample sizes meaningfully inform relative importance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4.3, Algorithm 1] Formalizes the weighted aggregation procedure.
  - [Section 5.3] Demonstrates interactive weight adjustment revealing hidden structure in epileptic and hatespeech datasets.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus precedent for interactive weighting in uncertainty-aware dimensionality reduction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Marginalization of multivariate Gaussians via Schur complement**
  - Why needed here: The PDF projection mechanism relies on analytically integrating out the orthogonal complement dimensions. Understanding how Gaussians marginalize (block matrix inversion, Schur complement) explains why the GMM projection has closed form.
  - Quick check question: Given X ~ N(μ, Σ) partitioned as [Y; Z], what is the marginal distribution of Y?

- Concept: **Between-component vs. within-component covariance in mixture models**
  - Why needed here: The aggregated covariance formula adds a term for dispersion of component means. Without this, UAPCA would underestimate total variance for multimodal distributions.
  - Quick check question: Why does Σ̂ = Σ_k w_k Σ_k alone underestimate variance when components have different means?

- Concept: **Kullback-Leibler divergence properties (asymmetry, sensitivity to support mismatch)**
  - Why needed here: KL divergence evaluates projection quality but penalizes slight shifts differently than Wasserstein distance. Understanding its asymmetry prevents misinterpreting quantitative results.
  - Quick check question: Why might KL(p||q) ≈ 0 while KL(q||p) >> 0 for the same distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. GMM Fitting Module -> Moment Aggregator -> Weighted Covariance Builder -> Eigendecomposition Engine -> PDF Projector -> Contour Extractor

- Critical path: Sample data → GMM fitting (BIC selection) → moment aggregation → Σ_UA computation → eigendecomposition → PDF projection → contour visualization. Computation time: 4–200ms for core operations (Section 5.1).

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GMM component count K: Too few underfits multimodal structure; too many overfits and introduces artifacts (see secom dataset in Figure 3).
  - Pre-fitting dimensionality reduction: Reducing to 50D before BIC improves stability but may discard information relevant to GMM structure.
  - Weight scheme: Sample-based weights reflect data but may hide minority classes; equal weights may overemphasize noise.

- Failure signatures:
  - Contour artifacts (spurious density spikes): Indicates GMM overfitting or poor component placement in high-D space.
  - Projected distributions disagree strongly with PCA-KDE reference: Check BIC selection, EM initialization sensitivity.
  - Ambiguous KL vs. SW2 results (e.g., seismic dataset): Ground truth (KDE) may be unreliable, or both methods approximate poorly.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validation on known Gaussian data**: Generate data from ground-truth GMMs, verify projected PDF exactly matches theoretical projection (closed-form validation).
  2. **Component sensitivity analysis**: On a multimodal dataset (e.g., bank), vary K from 1 to 20, plot KL/SW2 vs. K to verify BIC-selected K is near optimum.
  3. **Weight manipulation stress test**: On hatespeech dataset, sweep τ for HATESPEECH class from 0.01 to 0.99, quantify how other classes' KL divergence changes as they're de-emphasized.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can direct numerical integration methods based on the marginalization formula (Eq. 3) be developed to project arbitrary probability density functions without requiring intermediate Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitting?
- Basis: [explicit] Discussion and Conclusion: "In the future, we plan to investigate direct integrations based on Eq. (3) to further improve the projection of distributions."
- Why unresolved: The current method relies on fitting GMMs, which introduces fitting complexity and potential model mismatch; the general formula for arbitrary PDFs is provided but not solved for non-GMM cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm that computes the projected PDF using Eq. (3) directly for non-parametric distributions, demonstrating comparable or superior accuracy to the GMM-based approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the use of global optimization algorithms or "best of n" selection strategies for GMM fitting significantly reduce projection error compared to the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm?
- Basis: [explicit] Discussion: "Our evaluation used GMM fitting via expectation maximization, which is prone to converging to suboptimal solutions... Using a 'best of n' selection strategy, or a different fitting algorithm would possibly improve our results."
- Why unresolved: The authors identify that EM is prone to local optima but do not test alternative fitting methods to quantify the improvement in projection quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of wGMM-UAPCA results using different fitting initialization techniques, measuring the stability and fidelity of the resulting projections.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the computational complexity of high-dimensional GMM fitting be mitigated by performing the fitting entirely within a reduced feature space without losing the uncertainty characteristics preserved by the full-dimensional fit?
- Basis: [inferred] Discussion: "...selection and fitting of GMM components in high-dimensional space introduce additional complexity if they are not given in the first place."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation fits GMMs in the full high-dimensional space to ensure accuracy, despite BIC selection occurring in a reduced space; fitting in the reduced space might be faster but risks information loss.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks comparing the runtime and projection fidelity (e.g., KL divergence) of GMMs fitted in reduced dimensions versus the original high-dimensional space.

## Limitations
- The approach assumes GMMs adequately model high-dimensional uncertainty distributions, which may fail for distributions with complex dependencies or heavy tails.
- The fixed projection basis P serves all mixture components simultaneously, which may distort class-specific structures when covariance matrices differ substantially across classes.
- Contour extraction relies on numerical integration that may introduce artifacts if grid resolution is insufficient.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The marginalization mechanism for projecting GMM PDFs (Mechanism 1) is mathematically sound and well-supported by the closed-form derivation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The aggregated moment computation (Mechanism 2) and weighted covariance construction (Mechanism 3) are theoretically correct but their practical impact depends on the quality of GMM fits and appropriate weight selection.
- **Low Confidence**: The quantitative evaluation's reliability is uncertain given the KL divergence's asymmetry and sensitivity to support mismatch, particularly when comparing against PCA-KDE ground truth that may itself be approximate.

## Next Checks

1. **Ground-truth validation**: Generate synthetic data from known GMMs with varying numbers of components and dimensionalities, then verify that the projected PDF exactly matches the theoretical projection formula.
2. **Component sensitivity analysis**: On the bank dataset, systematically vary K from 1 to 20 components per class, plot KL divergence and SW2 distance versus K, and verify that BIC-selected K is near the optimal value.
3. **Weight sensitivity stress test**: On the hatespeech dataset, sweep the importance weight τ for the HATESPEECH class from 0.01 to 0.99 in 0.1 increments, quantifying how the KL divergence of other classes changes as the hatespeech class is increasingly emphasized or de-emphasized.
