# Enhancing Machine Learning Model Efficiency through Quantization and Bit Depth Optimization: A Performance Analysis on Healthcare Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12568
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12568
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Quantization reduced time complexity by up to 90% with minimal accuracy loss on medical datasets

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates quantization and bit-depth optimization techniques to improve machine learning efficiency while preserving accuracy, using Logistic Regression on two medical datasets. The research demonstrates that quantization methods including QuantileTransformer, Numpy.round, and KBinsDiscretizer can significantly reduce computational time with minimal accuracy degradation when applied to healthcare data. The results show time complexity reductions of 50-90% while maintaining accuracy within 1-2 percentage points of unoptimized models, indicating that quantization is a viable optimization technique for medical applications when appropriate methods are selected for specific datasets.

## Method Summary
The study applied three quantization techniques (QuantileTransformer, Numpy.round, and KBinsDiscretizer) to reduce input data precision from float64 to float32 and int32 on two medical datasets using Logistic Regression. Performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics and time complexity measurements. The experiments compared pre-optimization results against post-quantization outcomes across both datasets, measuring the trade-off between computational efficiency and model performance. The analysis focused on identifying the most effective quantization method while quantifying the impact on both accuracy and computational requirements.

## Key Results
- Heart disease dataset accuracy: 87.38% (before) → 86.41% (QuantileTransformer float32) with time complexity reduced from 0.0029 to 0.0014 seconds
- Breast cancer dataset accuracy: 96.49% (before) → 95.18% (QuantileTransformer float32) with time complexity dropping from 0.0258 to 0.0025 seconds
- QuantileTransformer consistently provided the best balance of accuracy preservation and computational efficiency across both datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Quantization reduces the precision of numerical representations in machine learning models, which decreases memory bandwidth requirements and computational complexity during inference. By transforming high-precision float64 values to lower-precision formats (float32 or int32), the number of bits required to represent each feature is reduced, leading to faster matrix operations and reduced storage requirements. The technique works particularly well on medical datasets where the signal-to-noise ratio remains sufficient even with reduced precision, allowing models to maintain diagnostic accuracy while benefiting from computational optimizations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Quantization fundamentals**: Understanding how numerical precision reduction affects model performance is essential for implementing efficient ML systems. Quick check: Verify precision reduction does not exceed the noise threshold of the specific dataset.
- **Time complexity measurement**: Accurate benchmarking of computational improvements requires proper timing methodology and control conditions. Quick check: Ensure measurements account for system variability and warm-up effects.
- **Model accuracy metrics**: Maintaining diagnostic utility requires careful monitoring of accuracy degradation during optimization. Quick check: Compare accuracy changes against clinical significance thresholds.
- **Medical dataset characteristics**: Understanding the statistical properties and noise levels of healthcare data informs quantization strategy selection. Quick check: Analyze feature distributions before applying quantization methods.
- **Logistic Regression optimization**: Knowledge of how linear models respond to quantization differs from deep learning approaches. Quick check: Validate that linear relationships remain intact after precision reduction.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Quantization transformation -> Logistic Regression training -> Performance evaluation

**Critical path:** Quantization transformation is the critical optimization point, directly affecting both computational efficiency and model accuracy.

**Design tradeoffs:** The primary tradeoff involves balancing computational gains against accuracy loss, with different quantization methods offering varying performance characteristics depending on dataset properties.

**Failure signatures:** Excessive accuracy degradation (>2-3%) indicates inappropriate quantization method selection or over-aggressive precision reduction. Inconsistent performance across similar datasets suggests method sensitivity to data distribution.

**3 first experiments:**
1. Apply all three quantization methods to a small subset of the dataset to identify the most promising approach before full-scale testing
2. Gradually reduce precision levels (float64→float32→int32) to determine the optimal tradeoff point for each dataset
3. Compare quantization performance across different machine learning algorithms to assess generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to Logistic Regression model type, constraining generalizability to other architectures
- Only two medical datasets tested, limiting statistical confidence in method selection recommendations
- Does not evaluate clinical utility metrics beyond basic accuracy, such as sensitivity or specificity
- Missing analysis of memory usage, power consumption, and deployment-specific constraints
- No assessment of model robustness or calibration changes after quantization

## Confidence
- Quantization effectiveness across medical datasets (Medium confidence): Based on two datasets, showing consistent improvements but limited sample size
- QuantileTransformer as the most reliable method (Low confidence): Premature to establish universal superiority without broader testing
- Practical viability for medical applications (Medium confidence): Technical feasibility demonstrated but lacks clinical deployment considerations

## Next Checks
1. Test the same quantization pipeline across diverse medical imaging, time-series, and structured data modalities to assess method robustness beyond tabular datasets
2. Evaluate quantized models using clinical performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve to ensure diagnostic utility is preserved
3. Conduct memory and power consumption benchmarks on edge devices representative of clinical deployment scenarios to validate practical efficiency gains
