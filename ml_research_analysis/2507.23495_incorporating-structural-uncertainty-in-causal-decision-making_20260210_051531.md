# Incorporating structural uncertainty in causal decision making

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Bayesian model averaging over causal structures improves decision-making under structural uncertainty

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of decision-making under structural uncertainty in causal inference, where practitioners typically assume a single causal structure is known. The core contribution is a framework that explicitly incorporates structural uncertainty into causal decision-making by averaging over competing causal structures rather than committing to a single model. The method demonstrates significant improvements in decision quality, particularly for small sample sizes and when causal effects differ substantially between competing structures.

The framework provides a principled approach to hedging against structural misspecification while maintaining optimality when genuine uncertainty exists. Through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, the paper shows that Bayesian model averaging consistently outperforms traditional model selection approaches, with average performance improvements of 0.103 that are highly significant across various scenarios.

## Method Summary
The method involves Bayesian model averaging over competing causal structures (e.g., X → Y vs X ← Y) to incorporate structural uncertainty into decision-making. The approach assumes prior probabilities over different causal structures and computes posterior probabilities based on observed data. Decisions are then made by averaging expected utilities across all plausible structures weighted by their posterior probabilities. The framework establishes conditions under which this approach is optimal, particularly when structural uncertainty is moderate to high, causal effects differ substantially between structures, and loss functions are sensitive to effect size differences.

## Key Results
- Model averaging consistently outperforms model selection across various scenarios with average performance improvements of 0.103 (t=29.156, p<0.001)
- Benefits are particularly pronounced for small sample sizes and when causal effects are large
- Theoretical analysis establishes optimality conditions for the model averaging approach
- Framework successfully hedges against structural misspecification while maintaining optimality under genuine uncertainty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly acknowledging and quantifying uncertainty about the true causal structure rather than committing to a single model. By averaging decisions across multiple plausible structures weighted by their posterior probabilities, the method naturally hedges against structural misspecification. This is particularly valuable when sample sizes are small or when competing structures predict substantially different causal effects, as the averaging process smooths out potentially catastrophic errors from selecting the wrong structure.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian model averaging: Why needed - to incorporate uncertainty across multiple plausible models; Quick check - verify that posterior probabilities sum to 1
- Causal structure learning: Why needed - to identify competing causal hypotheses; Quick check - confirm that each structure represents a valid DAG
- Expected utility theory: Why needed - to make optimal decisions under uncertainty; Quick check - ensure utilities are properly specified for the decision problem
- Posterior model probabilities: Why needed - to weight structures by their plausibility; Quick check - verify Bayes factors are correctly computed
- Structural causal models: Why needed - to represent causal relationships formally; Quick check - confirm that each structure is complete and acyclic

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Prior -> Likelihood -> Posterior -> Decision
      -> Utility Function

Critical Path:
Prior beliefs about structures → Data likelihood computation → Posterior probability calculation → Expected utility averaging → Optimal decision

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational cost vs. model flexibility: More structures improve hedging but increase computation
- Prior specification: Strong priors improve small sample performance but may bias results
- Utility function design: Must be sensitive to effect size differences to realize full benefits

Failure Signatures:
- All posterior probabilities concentrate on one structure → model selection may suffice
- Very diffuse posteriors → need more data or informative priors
- Utility differences between structures are negligible → averaging provides little benefit

First Experiments:
1. Simulate two competing structures with known ground truth to verify averaging improves accuracy
2. Test small sample performance by varying sample size and measuring improvement magnitude
3. Evaluate sensitivity to prior specification by comparing results across different prior strengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Requires specification of prior probabilities over competing structures
- Computational cost increases with number of competing structures
- Benefits depend on substantial differences in causal effects between structures
- May not outperform model selection when one structure is clearly dominant

## Confidence
High: Theoretical optimality established under regularity conditions, simulation results show consistent significant improvements, framework is principled and well-grounded in causal inference literature

## Next Checks
1. Validate the framework on real-world datasets with known causal structures
2. Test robustness to model misspecification within each causal structure
3. Evaluate performance in high-dimensional settings with multiple potential structures
