# Multi-task GINN-LP for Multi-target Symbolic Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.13463
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13463
- Authors: Hussein Rajabu; Lijun Qian; Xishuang Dong
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Achieves MAE=0.71, RMSE=1.06 on Energy Efficiency dataset with interpretable symbolic equations

## Executive Summary
MTRGINN-LP extends the GINN-LP framework to multi-target symbolic regression by introducing shared representations through a backbone of power-term approximator blocks (PABs) combined with task-specific output layers. The method balances interpretability with predictive accuracy by using a symbolic loss that ensures consistency between neural predictions and extracted symbolic equations. Experiments on Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Agriculture datasets demonstrate competitive performance while producing interpretable Laurent polynomial equations that reveal underlying relationships between inputs and targets.

## Method Summary
MTRGINN-LP uses a shared backbone of K Power-term Approximator Blocks (PABs), each computing products of input features raised to learned exponents: $PAB_k(x) = \prod x_i^{w_{k,i}}$. Task-specific linear layers then combine these shared representations to produce independent predictions for each target. The total loss includes task-specific MSE, symbolic consistency loss (enforcing that extracted equations match neural predictions), and L1/L2 regularization. A progressive growth mechanism starts with few PABs and incrementally adds new blocks every 500 epochs, allowing the model to adaptively determine optimal capacity while preventing overfitting.

## Key Results
- On Energy Efficiency dataset: MAE=0.71, RMSE=1.06, outperforming Random Forest, SVR, and MLP baselines
- On Sustainable Agriculture dataset: MAE=0.33, RMSE=0.45 with extracted symbolic equations for both targets
- Ablation studies confirm symbolic loss is essential: without it, symbolic equation accuracy collapses (MAE jumps from 0.41 to 30.81 on Energy Efficiency)
- Progressive network growth consistently improves performance compared to fixed architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Shared backbone learning with task-specific outputs enables multi-target symbolic regression while preserving interpretability.
- Mechanism: Multiple Power-term Approximator Blocks (PABs) form a shared backbone. Each PAB approximates power terms via logarithmic and exponential activations (Equation 3-4: p = e^Σwᵢlog(xᵢ) = Πxᵢ^wᵢ). Task-specific linear layers then combine PAB outputs with learned weights, producing independent predictions while sharing underlying representations.
- Core assumption: Targets share latent mathematical structure expressible as multivariate Laurent polynomials.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability"
  - [section III.C] "the final output ŷₜ for target t is expressed as a linear combination of all PABs... ŷₜ = fₐₛₜ(bₜ + Σₖ wₜ,ₖ Πᵢ xᵢ^wₖ,ᵢ)"
  - [corpus] Related work on interpretable temporal graph regression (GINTRIP) similarly uses shared representations with interpretable components, but no direct comparison to MTRGINN-LP exists in corpus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Symbolic loss is essential for extracting accurate symbolic equations from trained neural representations.
- Mechanism: During training, the algorithm generates monomial features m(x) = Πᵢ xᵢ^wᵢ from current weights, computes symbolic predictions ŷₛᵧₘ, and minimizes MSE between ŷₛᵧₘ and ground truth y. This consistency constraint forces neural weights toward configurations that yield valid symbolic expressions.
- Core assumption: Neural weights can be interpreted as exponents in Laurent polynomial terms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.C, Algorithm 1] "Compute symbolic prediction ŷₛᵧₘ... Compute consistency loss: Lₛᵧₘ"
  - [section IV.D.3, Table IV] Without symbolic loss, MTRGINN-LP (Eq.) performance collapses: Avg. MAE jumps from 0.41 to 30.81 on Energy Efficiency dataset
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—corpus papers discuss symbolic regression but do not analyze symbolic loss components specifically.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Progressive network growth mitigates overfitting while enabling adaptive capacity determination.
- Mechanism: Initialize with few PABs (1-3), then add new randomly-initialized PABs at fixed intervals (every 500 epochs) while preserving trained parameters. Growth continues until early stopping or max PABs reached.
- Core assumption: Optimal model complexity is unknown a priori and should emerge from training dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.B] "Starting with a single PAB, the model incrementally adds new, randomly initialized blocks while retaining previously trained parameters to prevent overfitting"
  - [section IV.D.1, Figure 4] "models initialized with fewer PABs generally achieve lower errors after expansion than those starting with higher initial counts"
  - [corpus] No comparable growth mechanisms found in corpus papers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multivariate Laurent Polynomials
  - Why needed here: The entire GINN-LP framework assumes target relationships can be expressed as linear combinations of power terms. Understanding that Laurent polynomials allow both positive and negative exponents is critical for interpreting learned equations.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why x⁻² is a valid term in a Laurent polynomial but not in a standard polynomial?

- Concept: Multi-Task Learning with Hard Parameter Sharing
  - Why needed here: MTRGINN-LP uses hard parameter sharing via shared PAB backbone. Understanding how shared representations can transfer (or interfere) across tasks informs architecture decisions.
  - Quick check question: What happens to all tasks if the shared backbone learns features useful for task A but harmful for task B?

- Concept: Symbolic Regression vs. Black-Box Regression
  - Why needed here: The core value proposition is interpretable equations rather than just accurate predictions. Distinguishing between predictive performance (MAE/RMSE) and symbolic fidelity is essential for evaluation.
  - Quick check question: Why might a symbolic equation with MAE=1.02 be preferred over a neural network with MAE=0.60 in a high-stakes domain?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> K PABs (shared backbone) -> T task-specific linear layers -> Output predictions
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize: 1-3 PABs, set hyperparameters (max PABs=6-10, growing interval=500, λ values)
  2. Forward pass: Compute PAB outputs → Linear combination per task → Predictions
  3. Loss computation: Task loss + Symbolic loss + L1/L2 regularization
  4. Growth check: Every 500 epochs, add new PAB if below max
  5. Extract equations: After training, read weights directly as symbolic coefficients

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More PABs → Higher capacity but risk of overfitting and less interpretable equations
  - Higher λₛᵧₘ → Better symbolic accuracy but potentially worse neural predictions
  - Smaller growing interval → Faster capacity increase but less stable training per block

- Failure signatures:
  - Symbolic equations with wildly inaccurate predictions (MAE > 10× baseline) → Symbolic loss disabled or λₛᵧₘ too low
  - Neural predictions much better than symbolic equations → Check monomial feature generation
  - Training instability after growth events → Reduce learning rate or increase warmup for new PABs
  - All PAB weights near zero → L1/L2 regularization too aggressive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce single-dataset baseline: Train on Energy Efficiency with default hyperparameters (max PABs=8, init=1, λₛᵧₘ=1e-2). Verify MAE ≈ 0.71 and symbolic equations match Figure 2 format.
  2. Ablate symbolic loss: Disable Lₛᵧₘ component. Confirm symbolic equation accuracy collapses (MAE should jump to 30+) while neural predictions degrade only slightly.
  3. Test target independence assumption: Train two single-target GINN-LP models (one per target) and compare to multi-task version. Assess whether shared representations help or hurt each target.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: Can the integration of non-exponential function primitives (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic, or sigmoid) into the Power-term Approximator Blocks (PABs) improve the recovery of ground-truth equations for non-polynomial systems?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion and Limitations sections state the representational ability is currently limited because it "relies exclusively on exponential forms," and suggest incorporating linear, polynomial, sine, cosine, or logarithmic terms.
  - Why unresolved: The current PAB architecture is mathematically restricted to approximating multivariate Laurent polynomials, making it unable to capture periodic or saturating behaviors inherent in many physical systems.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Successful extraction of symbolic equations containing trigonometric terms on datasets like the Ng-10 or Feynman benchmarks, with lower recovery error than the current exponential-only model.

- Question: Does employing heterogeneous or dynamically adaptive PAB architectures provide a better trade-off between model complexity and accuracy than the current uniform block construction?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion and Limitations sections identify the uniform construction of all PABs as a constraint on flexibility, suggesting that "heterogeneous or dynamically adaptive PAB architectures" could better capture diverse data patterns.
  - Why unresolved: The current model uses a "one-size-fits-all" block structure, which may force the growing algorithm to add redundant blocks to capture simple relationships or fail to fit complex localized interactions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing that models with adaptive PAB configurations achieve equivalent or lower error (MAE/RMSE) using fewer total parameters or fewer blocks than the uniform baseline.

- Question: How does MTRGINN-LP perform relative to state-of-the-art multi-task symbolic regression baselines regarding the trade-off between predictive accuracy and equation complexity?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The experiments compare MTRGINN-LP against standard regression models (Random Forest, SVR, MLP) but do not benchmark it against other interpretable symbolic regression methods (e.g., Genetic Programming, Deep Symbolic Regression) to validate its efficiency.
  - Why unresolved: Without comparison to other SR methods, it is unclear if the "competitive performance" is a result of the multi-task architecture or simply the inherent flexibility of symbolic models, nor is it clear if the generated equations are overly complex relative to other SR techniques.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis on standard SR benchmarks measuring the Pareto frontier between equation complexity (e.g., node count) and prediction error against GP or EQL baselines.

## Limitations
- Framework assumes target relationships can be expressed as Laurent polynomials, which may not hold for all real-world problems
- Growing mechanism adds capacity but lacks principled stopping criteria
- Symbolic extraction quality depends critically on λₛᵧₘ hyperparameter tuning, which is dataset-specific
- Multi-task benefits are only demonstrated on two datasets with two targets each, limiting generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence: Neural prediction accuracy claims (MAE/RMSE values) are well-supported by experiments
- Medium confidence: Symbolic equation extraction works reliably given proper λₛᵧₘ tuning
- Low confidence: Multi-task benefits vs. independent training are under-validated

## Next Checks
1. Test MTRGINN-LP on datasets where targets have incompatible functional forms to verify shared backbone doesn't degrade performance
2. Systematically sweep λₛᵧₘ values to identify stability boundaries and optimal ranges across different dataset complexities
3. Compare computational efficiency against independent single-target GINN-LP models to quantify multi-task overhead
