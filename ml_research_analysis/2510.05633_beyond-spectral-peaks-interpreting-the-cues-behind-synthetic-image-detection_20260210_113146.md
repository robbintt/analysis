# Beyond Spectral Peaks: Interpreting the Cues Behind Synthetic Image Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.05633
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05633
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Key outcome**: Systematic peak removal shows most deep detectors don't fundamentally rely on spectral peaks

## Executive Summary
This work challenges the common assumption that spectral peaks are key to detecting synthetic images. Through a systematic approach that removes periodic frequency peaks from both synthetic and laundered images, the authors evaluate multiple state-of-the-art detectors. They also introduce a simple linear detector that relies solely on spectral peaks. The results show that most deep learning-based detectors are not significantly affected by peak removal, suggesting they do not fundamentally rely on these artifacts. Only one detector behaves similarly to the linear baseline, showing a notable performance drop when peaks are removed. This indicates that many detectors may be exploiting other cues beyond spectral peaks, opening the door for more interpretable forensic tools and hybrid approaches combining deep learning with model-based methods.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from images by applying a binary mask in the Fourier domain that zeros out frequency components at periodic grid positions (P×P where P = 4, 8, or 16), with morphological dilation ensuring complete peak energy suppression while preserving the DC component. They evaluate this on multiple datasets including Wild (synthetic images from 10 generators), RAISE (real images), and laundered images (real images passed through SDXL, SD3.5, Flux.1 autoencoders). A simple linear detector is introduced that relies exclusively on frequency peaks by applying a Laplacian of Gaussian kernel to extract high-pass residuals, computing the magnitude spectrum, averaging energy on fixed grids, and thresholding for classification. The evaluation measures True Positive Rate at fixed thresholds and calculates relative TPR differences before vs. after peak removal.

## Key Results
- Most deep learning-based detectors show minimal performance change when spectral peaks are removed, suggesting they don't fundamentally rely on these artifacts
- Only one detector ([3]) shows substantial performance drops comparable to the linear baseline, indicating peak dependence
- The linear detector exhibits near-complete performance collapse after peak removal (~60–100% relative TPR drops), establishing a reference pattern for "true" peak dependence
- Some detectors even show performance improvements on laundered images after peak removal, suggesting peaks may act as confounding factors

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Systematic removal of spectral peaks enables causal inference about detector feature reliance. A binary mask in the Fourier domain zeros out frequency components at periodic grid positions (P×P where P = 4, 8, or 16), with morphological dilation ensuring complete peak energy suppression while preserving the DC component to maintain image statistics. If a detector fundamentally relies on spectral peaks, its true positive rate should decrease substantially when those peaks are removed; minimal performance change indicates reliance on other features.

### Mechanism 2
A purely linear peak-based detector provides an interpretable baseline that isolates spectral peak reliance from deep learning confounds. The detector applies a Laplacian of Gaussian kernel (σ=0.7) to extract high-pass residuals, computes the magnitude spectrum, averages energy on fixed 8×8 or 16×16 grids, and thresholds for binary classification. The linear detector's near-complete performance collapse after peak removal (observed ~60–100% relative TPR drops) establishes a reference pattern for "true" peak dependence.

### Mechanism 3
Differential performance patterns across detectors reveal heterogeneous feature reliance, with most deep detectors appearing independent of spectral peaks. The relative TPR difference (Rm8, Rm16) between peak-removed and original conditions shows that detectors behaving like the linear baseline (large drops) are peak-dependent, while stable detectors exploit other cues.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fourier Transform and Periodic Frequency Artifacts**: Why needed here: The entire methodology depends on understanding how upsampling operations in generators create periodic peaks at specific spatial frequencies. Quick check: Given a peak at normalized frequency (1/8, 1/8), what spatial pattern does this correspond to in the image domain?

- **High-Pass Filtering for Artifact Isolation**: Why needed here: Spectral peaks from generation are subtle and often obscured by dominant image content; noise residuals make them visible. Quick check: Why might a Laplacian of Gaussian filter be preferred over a simple high-pass filter for revealing synthetic image artifacts?

- **Controlled Ablation for Causal Interpretability**: Why needed here: Without systematic feature removal, observed correlations between spectral peaks and detection performance do not establish causation. Quick check: What confounding factors could cause a detector to appear peak-dependent even if it doesn't use peak information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input image → FFT → Binary mask (periodicity P, with dilation) → Inverse FFT → Dynamic rescaling → 8-bit quantization
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Verify generator-specific periodicity: Visualize spectra to confirm P=8 or P=16 is correct for target generator
  2. Validate complete peak suppression: Inspect post-removal spectra to ensure dilation adequately suppresses peak neighborhoods
  3. Filter evaluation scenarios: Exclude detector-generator pairs with baseline TPR < 70% (insufficient initial performance for meaningful comparison)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Dilation extent: Larger structuring elements ensure complete suppression but risk introducing low-frequency distortions
  - Periodicity selection: Testing both P=8 and P=16 increases coverage across generators but complicates interpretation
  - Compression exclusion: Removing JPEG-compressed images avoids 8×8 grid confounds but limits ecological validity

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Inconsistent cross-generator behavior: Detector [3] drops on Flux.1/SD3.5/Midjourney but not DALL·E 3/Leonardo AI
  - TPR increases after removal: Detectors [4, 5, 9] on laundered images show positive Rm values
  - Linear detector exceptions: Linear-8 shows <20% drop on Flux 1.1Pro and SD3.5 due to dominant P=16 periodicity

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Visual validation of peak removal: Take 50 images from SDXL (P=8 dominant), apply removal mask, plot averaged log-magnitude spectra before/after
  2. Linear detector calibration check: On held-out real images (n=500), verify linear-8 and linear-16 achieve ~5% false alarm rate
  3. Single detector ablation deep-dive: Run detector [3] on three conditions — original, P=8 removal only, P=16 removal only

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific generative traces or visual cues are deep learning-based detectors exploiting to distinguish synthetic images if they are not relying on spectral peaks? The paper demonstrates that many detectors are not peak-dependent but does not identify the alternative features they use instead.

### Open Question 2
Can hybrid detection strategies combining deep learning with model-based linear methods successfully balance representational power with interpretability? The paper suggests this as a promising direction for future research.

### Open Question 3
Does the removal of spectral peaks significantly impact detector performance on images that have undergone common post-processing operations like JPEG compression? The study isolates spectral peaks by removing compression, but real-world scenarios involve ubiquitous compression.

## Limitations
- The peak removal process may introduce subtle artifacts beyond peak suppression that could affect detector behavior
- The linear baseline may oversimplify and fail to capture complex feature interactions that deep detectors access
- Performance drops on laundered images showing positive Rm values suggest peak removal might sometimes reduce confounding rather than reveal true feature dependence
- The closed-set nature of the evaluation limits generalizability to unseen generators

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Most deep detectors do not fundamentally rely on spectral peaks (supported by consistent stable performance across multiple detectors and generators)
- **Medium confidence**: Peak removal is a valid causal intervention for interpretability (methodologically sound but potential for unintended artifacts)
- **Medium confidence**: Linear detector provides appropriate interpretability baseline (simplistic by design, may underestimate what "peak reliance" could mean in richer architectures)

## Next Checks

1. **Spectra validation**: Plot averaged log-magnitude spectra for 50 SDXL images before and after peak removal to verify complete suppression without introducing new artifacts

2. **Dilation parameter sensitivity**: Systematically vary dilation radius/iterations and measure impact on both peak suppression completeness and detector performance stability

3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Test the peak removal methodology on a separate dataset (e.g., RAISE) with different image characteristics to assess robustness of findings beyond the Wild dataset
