# Metric Design != Metric Behavior: Improving Metric Selection for the Unbiased Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.02225
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02225
- Authors: Jiyeon Bae; Hyeon Jeon; Jinwook Seo
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Clustering evaluation metrics by empirical behavior (correlation) rather than design intent reduces redundancy and improves the stability of DR technique rankings by up to 15%.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of biased evaluation in dimensionality reduction by demonstrating that commonly used evaluation metrics are often highly correlated, leading to redundant and skewed assessments that favor DR techniques optimizing similar structural characteristics. The authors propose a workflow that selects evaluation metrics based on their empirical behavior across diverse projections rather than their intended design characteristics. By computing pairwise correlations of metric rankings across 96 datasets and 300 projections each, they cluster metrics by similarity and select representative metrics from each cluster. Quantitative experiments show this cluster-based selection strategy improves rank stability by up to 15% compared to random or class-based selection, indicating reduced evaluation bias.

## Method Summary
The workflow clusters DR evaluation metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than design intent. It computes pairwise Spearman rank correlations between all metric pairs across 96 high-dimensional datasets, each with 300 diverse projections generated by randomly sampling from 40 DR techniques and hyperparameter ranges. These correlations are converted to distances (1 - ρ) and used for hierarchical clustering with average linkage. Representative metrics are selected from each cluster based on highest average similarity within-cluster, and the optimal number of clusters is determined via the elbow method on normalized diversity. The approach is validated by comparing rank stability of DR technique rankings across different selection strategies.

## Key Results
- Clustering metrics by empirical behavior rather than design characteristics improves evaluation stability by up to 15%
- Class-based metric selection (Local/Cluster/Global) does not align with actual metric behavior
- Optimal evaluation set comprises five representative metrics covering local, cluster-level, and global structural properties
- Cluster-based selection achieves highest rank stability across trials (F_{2,2012} = 315.84, p < 0.001)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Clustering metrics by empirical behavior (correlation) rather than design intent reduces evaluation redundancy.
- **Mechanism:** The workflow computes pairwise Spearman correlations across a large matrix of projections (96 datasets × 300 projections). By converting these correlations to distances (1 - ρ) and clustering, the system groups metrics that effectively measure the same structural variations, ensuring that a representative set covers distinct behavioral axes rather than repeating the same measurement logic.
- **Core assumption:** Metric behavior is consistent across diverse datasets; high correlation implies redundancy in evaluation context.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than on their intended design characteristics alone." [section 5.2] "...clusters do not strictly align with the original, design-based classes... reaffirming the value of our workflow..."
- **Break condition:** If metrics exhibit high dataset-specific variance where correlation structures do not generalize, the clustering will fail to identify universally redundant metrics.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Selecting representative metrics from independent clusters improves the stability of DR technique rankings.
- **Mechanism:** By selecting one metric per behavior-cluster (e.g., the one with highest average similarity to others in the cluster), the evaluation set minimizes the overweighting of specific structural artifacts. This leads to more consistent rankings of DR techniques across different metric subsets, defined as "rank stability."
- **Core assumption:** Ranking stability is a valid proxy for reduced bias.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.2] "...cluster-based selection strategy achieves the highest rank stability across trials... (F_{2,2012} = 315.84, p < 0.001)" [section 4.1] "If a strategy is biased, the structural characteristics emphasized by the chosen metrics vary widely... causing the overall ranking... to fluctuate."
- **Break condition:** If the "stability" metric captures non-meaningful consistency (e.g., consistently poor evaluation), this mechanism does not guarantee improved accuracy, only reduced variance.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Maximizing the minimum dissimilarity between selected metrics (Diversity) ensures comprehensive structural coverage.
- **Mechanism:** The selection process prioritizes diversity, calculated as the minimum dissimilarity between a metric and its nearest neighbor in the set. By optimizing for k=5 clusters via the elbow method, the workflow balances coverage and compactness, preventing the evaluation from "over-focusing" on a single scale (e.g., purely local neighborhoods).
- **Core assumption:** A diverse set of uncorrelated metrics captures the "ground truth" of projection quality better than a correlated set.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 5.1] "We define diversity as the minimum dissimilarity between each metric and its nearest neighbor..." [section 5.2] "The representative set comprises two local metrics... one cluster-level metric... and two global metrics."
- **Break condition:** If two uncorrelated metrics measure conflicting or irrelevant structural properties, maximizing diversity might introduce noise rather than clarity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Spearman's Rank Correlation (ρ)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the fundamental similarity measure for the entire workflow. Unlike Pearson, Spearman captures monotonic relationships even if metric scores are non-linearly distributed, which is critical when comparing diverse DR metrics.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is rank correlation preferred over raw value correlation when comparing the behavior of different evaluation metrics?

- **Concept:** **Structural Preservation Scales (Local vs. Global)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper argues that design categories (Local, Cluster, Global) are insufficient for selection. Understanding these categories is necessary to appreciate why the authors propose a behavior-based alternative.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the three traditional classes of DR evaluation metrics mentioned in the paper?

- **Concept:** **Hierarchical Clustering (Average Linkage)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the algorithmic engine used to group metrics based on their distance matrix (1 - ρ). Average linkage is chosen for its stability and robustness to noise.
  - **Quick check question:** In this workflow, how is the "distance" between two metrics derived from their Spearman correlation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Projection Generator -> Metric Calculator -> Similarity Engine -> Clustering Module -> Selector
- **Critical path:** The Projection Generator is the bottleneck. If the projections do not cover the space of possible distortions sufficiently, the subsequent correlation matrix will not reflect true metric behavior, and the clustering will be invalid.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Compactness vs. Coverage:** The authors settle on k=5 metrics. Lower k loses structural coverage; higher k introduces redundancy and computational cost.
  - **Generality vs. Specificity:** The workflow uses 96 diverse datasets to create a "general" recommendation. For niche datasets (e.g., specific medical imaging), these general correlations might not hold.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Uniform Correlation Matrix:** If correlations are all near 1.0, the projections are likely too similar or metrics are degenerate.
  - **Singleton Clusters:** Metrics that cannot be grouped likely measure unique artifacts or are noisy; the paper removes these as outliers.
  - **Rank Instability:** If the selected metric set fluctuates wildly in ranking DR techniques on new data, the "behavior" learned during training did not generalize.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Correlation Verification:** Reproduce the heatmap in Figure 2 on a small subset of data to verify that "Design != Behavior" (e.g., confirm that a local and global metric land in the same cluster).
  2. **Stability Stress Test:** Run the random vs. cluster-based selection strategy on a new DR technique not in the original 40 to see if the cluster-based rankings remain more stable.
  3. **Elbow Sensitivity:** Vary the number of selected metrics (k=4 vs k=5) and measure the change in the "Diversity" score to validate the "elbow" at 5.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does cluster-based metric selection maintain its stability advantages when evaluated on a significantly larger and more diverse set of datasets and DR techniques?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "In future work, we will examine whether our findings can be generalized by utilizing a larger set of datasets and DR techniques."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study uses 96 datasets and 40 DR techniques, which cannot capture the full range of real-world data distributions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Replicating the workflow on expanded benchmarks (e.g., hundreds of additional datasets spanning new domains) and demonstrating consistent improvements in rank stability.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the correlation-based clustering workflow be effectively adapted to mitigate metric redundancy and bias in other evaluation domains such as NLP or medical image segmentation?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] "We plan to generalize our workflow to a broader range of machine learning and visualization evaluation tasks" including machine translation metrics and medical image segmentation.
- **Why unresolved:** Different domains have unique constraints (e.g., balancing semantic preservation with fluency in text, or segmentation accuracy with boundary precision) that may require domain-specific modifications.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Successful application of the workflow to cluster and select metrics in target domains, showing improved evaluation stability or reduced redundancy.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does cluster-based metric selection improve performance on downstream visual analytics tasks compared to class-based or random selection?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The evaluation focuses solely on rank stability as a proxy for reduced bias, but does not measure whether this leads to better outcomes in actual visual analysis tasks (e.g., cluster identification, anomaly detection).
- **Why unresolved:** Rank stability indicates consistency but does not guarantee that the selected metrics align with task-relevant structural preservation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** User studies or task-based experiments showing that practitioners using cluster-selected metrics make more accurate or faster analytical decisions.

## Limitations
- **Metric Definitions Unknown:** The complete set of 38+ evaluation metrics and their precise implementations are not specified, making exact replication difficult without access to the referenced Zadu library or Appendix B.
- **Dataset Generality Assumption:** The clustering of metric behavior is based on 96 diverse datasets, but the assumption that these correlations generalize to all domains (especially niche datasets) is untested.
- **Rank Stability Proxy:** The use of rank stability as a proxy for "reduced bias" is a derived metric; it is not proven that stable rankings equate to accurate or fair evaluation.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core methodological contribution (clustering metrics by empirical behavior) and the demonstration that design-based classes are insufficient are well-supported by the provided evidence.
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that the proposed k=5 metric set is optimal for all users is well-argued but relies on the representativeness of the 96 datasets.
- **Low Confidence:** The assumption that the observed correlation structures are universally applicable is a significant leap not fully validated by the provided corpus.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalizability Test:** Apply the workflow to a new, unseen dataset type (e.g., a specific domain like genomics) and verify if the identified metric clusters and their correlations remain consistent.
2. **Rank Accuracy Validation:** Instead of just measuring rank stability, design an experiment to compare the rankings produced by the cluster-based metric set against a known ground truth (e.g., a human-annotated quality assessment) to validate that stability equates to accuracy.
3. **Metric Redundancy Stress Test:** Systematically remove one of the five recommended metrics and measure the impact on rank stability and diversity. This will test if all five are truly necessary or if a smaller, more compact set could suffice.
