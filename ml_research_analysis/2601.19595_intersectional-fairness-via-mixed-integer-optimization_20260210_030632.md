# Intersectional Fairness via Mixed-Integer Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.19595
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19595
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: MIO-based framework trains interpretable classifiers with bounded intersectional bias while maintaining accuracy close to unconstrained models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses intersectional fairness in machine learning by detecting and mitigating bias at the intersections of protected groups. The authors propose a unified framework leveraging Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and interpretable classifiers. They prove the equivalence of two fairness measures (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that their MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias while training high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold.

## Method Summary
The framework trains interpretable classifiers (linear, DNF) under intersectional fairness constraints using Mixed-Integer Optimization. It has two components: (1) bias detection via most-unfair subgroup identification using MIO formulations, and (2) fair classifier training with lazy constraint generation. The approach iteratively solves the base MIO, identifies the most-violating subgroup via a separate MIO call, and adds that constraint only if it violates threshold γ. This repeats until convergence or timeout. The framework uses conjunction-based subgroups (S_A) for interpretability and higher accuracy compared to linear-threshold subgroups (S_L).

## Key Results
- Proved SPSF and MSD identify the same most-unfair subgroup despite different formulations
- Lazy constraint generation requires only 0.8–22.5 mean cuts vs. up to 56 million possible subgroups
- Achieved γ-FPSF fairness on test data with performance close to unconstrained models
- Conjunction-based subgroups yield higher-accuracy classifiers than linear thresholds while guaranteeing fairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: SPSF-MSD Equivalence in Subgroup Detection
- Claim: SPSF and MSD identify the same most-unfair subgroup
- Mechanism: Theorem 1 establishes SPSF(h, S) equals Subgroup Discrepancy scaled by 1/[P(h)·P(¬h)], making the argmax identical for both measures
- Core assumption: Classifier's positive/negative rates remain stable enough that scaling factor doesn't change ordinal ranking
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] equivalence proof; [section 3.1] Corollary 1.1 formal proof; [corpus] weak direct support
- Break condition: Solver time limits prevent convergence, yielding different detected subgroups (Figure 2)

### Mechanism 2: Lazy Constraint Generation for Exponential Subgroup Spaces
- Claim: Training with exponentially many intersectional subgroup constraints is tractable
- Mechanism: Iteratively adds only most-violating constraint after base MIO solve, repeating until convergence
- Core assumption: Only small fraction of subgroups violate fairness threshold
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.2] lazy constraints explanation; [Table 1] 0.8–22.5 mean cuts vs. 56M subgroups; [corpus] no direct validation
- Break condition: Auditing MIO fails to find true most-violating subgroup within time limits, accepting invalid solutions

### Mechanism 3: Conjunction vs. Linear Subgroup Representations
- Claim: Conjunction-based subgroups yield higher-accuracy classifiers than linear thresholds
- Mechanism: S_A ⊆ S_L makes constraining fairness on S_A less restrictive, allowing higher-accuracy solutions with interpretable descriptions
- Core assumption: Protected attributes can be meaningfully discretized
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1] subset relationship explanation; [section 4.2] performance improvement results; [corpus] related work doesn't compare representation classes
- Break condition: Continuous attributes without natural discretization thresholds obscure meaningful patterns

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**
  - Why needed here: Entire framework relies on formulating fairness constraints and classifier structures as MILP problems solvable by commercial solvers
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the subgroup detection problem requires binary variables (u_j) and what they represent in the conjunction formulation?

- Concept: **Lazy Constraints / Cutting Planes**
  - Why needed here: Core computational trick enabling tractable training with exponentially many subgroup constraints
  - Quick check question: What happens if the "auditor" MIO subproblem returns a suboptimal subgroup—does the framework still converge to a feasible solution?

- Concept: **Statistical Parity Subgroup Fairness (SPSF)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding why P(S) · |P(h=1) − P(h=1|S)| ≤ γ captures intersectional unfairness is essential for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: Why does SPSF multiply by P(S)—what problem does this solve compared to raw conditional probability gaps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Detection Module -> Training Module -> Lazy Constraint Controller
- Critical path: Initialize classifier MIO with no fairness constraints → Solve to get incumbent ŷ → Call detection MIO to find most-violating subgroup S* → If unfairness(S*) ≤ γ → terminate → Else add S* as constraint, goto step 2
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Detection time budget: Longer budgets find truer violations but slow training (paper uses 5 min detection with 4 hr total)
  - Subgroup representation: S_A (conjunctions) → better accuracy, interpretable subgroups; S_L (linear) → may catch more complex patterns but harder to optimize
  - Sparsity regularization (σ): Higher σ → fewer non-zero coefficients, better interpretability, often improved test fairness (Figure 4), but potential accuracy drop
- Failure signatures:
  - Training unfairness > γ on train data: Detection MIO didn't converge; increase detection time budget
  - Few cuts generated, high test unfairness: Auditor failing to find violations
  - GerryFair comparison shows higher violations: MIO not given enough time
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate detection comparison (Figure 2) on single dataset: run MIO-SPSF, MIO-MSD, and GerryFair with 10-min limit
  2. Run training framework with γ=0.01 on ACS Income with conjunction subgroups; confirm cuts < 10 and test FPSF within ~1.5× threshold
  3. Add sparsity term (σ=0.1) to linear classifier; compare test FPSF and non-zero coefficients to dense baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the equivalence between MSD and SPSF be leveraged to develop polynomial-time approximation algorithms for SPSF auditing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states: "Since MSD amounts to optimizing balanced 0-1 error, this might open the possibility of using more general training algorithms even for SPSF."
- Why unresolved: Paper proves equivalence in subgroup detection but doesn't explore whether this enables faster algorithms avoiding MIO's exponential worst-case complexity
- What evidence would resolve it: Polynomial-time approximation scheme for SPSF auditing with provable guarantees, or proof that SPSF auditing remains hard despite MSD connection

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can intersectional fairness be reliably evaluated and enforced for subgroups with insufficient sample sizes due to the curse of dimensionality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges: "there are subgroups for which an insufficient amount of data prevents a reliable evaluation of bias due to the curse of dimensionality"
- Why unresolved: Framework optimizes over representable subgroups but cannot guarantee fairness for underrepresented intersectional groups where statistical estimates are unreliable
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension with statistical bounds or Bayesian methods providing fairness guarantees for small-sample subgroups

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can column generation or other decomposition methods improve scalability for training complex interpretable models under intersectional fairness constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Appendix B.3 suggests: "choosing a column-generation approach, like [Dash et al., 2018], might improve the scalability of training the predictor itself"
- Why unresolved: DNF models showed "notably more time needed" and generated few cuts, suggesting current formulation struggles with feasibility
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison showing column-generation-based training achieves comparable fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with reduced computation time

### Open Question 4
- Question: What mechanisms can ensure intersectional fairness guarantees transfer from training to deployment without continuous re-auditing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Ethical statement notes: "our fairness guarantee applies only to training, while true bias mitigation requires continuous oversight"
- Why unresolved: Test-set FPSF violations exceeded training thresholds by up to 1.5x, indicating constrained models don't perfectly generalize fairness properties
- What evidence would resolve it: Generalization bounds for intersectional fairness measures, or empirical validation of fairness stability under distribution shift

## Limitations
- Equivalence between SPSF and MSD depends on stable classifier rates; solver time limits can cause detection failures
- Lazy constraint approach assumes few violations, which may not hold for highly biased data
- Discretization of continuous attributes for conjunction subgroups may lose nuanced fairness patterns

## Confidence

- **High**: Theorem 1 (SPSF-MSD equivalence) and Corollary 1.1 (set equality) - formal mathematical proofs with direct support in section 3.1
- **Medium**: Lazy constraint effectiveness - supported by Table 1 showing few cuts vs. millions of subgroups, but no external validation
- **Medium**: Conjunction vs. linear subgroup trade-off - logical argument supported by section 4.2 results, but no ablation study

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce detection equivalence: Run MIO-SPSF and MIO-MSD with 10-minute limits on ACS Income; verify they identify the same most-unfair subgroup when convergence is achieved
2. Test lazy constraint robustness: Intentionally set short detection time limits to force suboptimal subgroups; check if training still converges to feasible solutions or if unfairness violations persist
3. Ablate sparsity term: Compare FPSF fairness and interpretability (non-zero coefficients) with σ=0.1 vs. σ=0 and σ=1.0 on ACS Income linear classifier
