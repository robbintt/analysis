# Bridging Traditional Machine Learning and Large Language Models: A Two-Part Course Design for Modern AI Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.05167
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05167
- Authors: Fang Li
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Two-part course design successfully bridges traditional ML and LLMs, enabling students to understand AI evolution while building practical skills

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive two-part course design that bridges traditional machine learning and modern Large Language Models to address gaps in AI education. The curriculum spans 14 weeks across two 7-week terms, covering foundational ML concepts in Part 1 and contemporary LLM applications in Part 2. The course uses a scaffolded structure with integrated theory-practice activities, hands-on Google Colab implementations, and collaborative group projects. Initial implementations show students develop comprehensive AI understanding and enhanced industry readiness, effectively combining traditional techniques with LLM capabilities.

## Method Summary
The course employs a two-part structure: Part 1 (7 weeks) covers foundational ML concepts including data science fundamentals, feature engineering, model development, and neural networks. Part 2 (7 weeks) focuses on LLM applications including transformer foundations, platforms and tools, prompt engineering, model deployment, and fine-tuning. The curriculum uses Google Colab notebooks for hands-on implementation, with integrated theory-practice activities in each module. Assessment includes individual assignments (40%), group projects (40%), participation (10%), and peer evaluation (10%). Group projects mandate professional software practices including GitHub workflows, code reviews, and documentation.

## Key Results
- Students develop comprehensive AI understanding spanning both traditional ML and LLM paradigms
- Enhanced industry readiness for positions requiring both established ML methodologies and contemporary LLM technologies
- Successful integration of professional software practices through GitHub workflows and collaborative projects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Explicit Conceptual Bridging Through Mapping Exercises
- Claim: Students learn LLM concepts more effectively when instruction draws deliberate parallels to traditional ML concepts they already understand.
- Mechanism: The curriculum uses structured "comparison matrices and mapping exercises" that connect pairs like feature engineering ↔ prompt engineering, and model evaluation ↔ LLM performance assessment. Assignment sequences require solving similar problems using both approaches, creating cognitive links.
- Core assumption: Students retain and transfer knowledge better when new concepts are anchored to prior mental models rather than taught as isolated paradigms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 7 explicitly states: "Students benefit significantly from structured discussions of how concepts like feature engineering relate to prompt engineering... We found success in creating comparison matrices and mapping exercises that make these connections explicit."
  - [section] Section 6.2 describes addressing conceptual integration difficulties through "explicit mapping exercises between concepts" and assignment sequences requiring dual-approach problem solving.
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; neighboring paper "Bridging the Skills Gap" similarly argues for connecting generative AI education to existing curricula but doesn't test this mechanism directly.
- Break condition: If students lack solid foundational ML understanding, mapping exercises will fail—new concepts won't have anchors. The paper acknowledges this by noting heterogeneous backgrounds required "supplementary resources for foundational skills" (Section 6.2).

### Mechanism 2: Scaffolded Complexity With Theory-Practice Integration Per Module
- Claim: Integrating theory and hands-on implementation within each module (rather than separating them) improves concept retention and practical skill transfer.
- Mechanism: Each learning module pairs theoretical explanation with immediate implementation in Google Colab. Students don't wait weeks to apply concepts—they implement within the same session. The progression is cumulative: data fundamentals → feature engineering → model development → neural networks → transformers → LLMs.
- Core assumption: Immediate application reinforces theoretical concepts more effectively than delayed practice; knowledge builds incrementally when each concept rests on the previous.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Describes "scaffolded structure with integrated theory-practice activities, hands-on Google Colab implementations."
  - [section] Section 3.2 states: "Rather than treating theory and practice as separate components, we integrate them throughout each learning module."
  - [corpus] No direct experimental comparison in corpus; assumption is pedagogical best practice without controlled validation in this paper.
- Break condition: If Colab resource constraints prevent students from completing implementations (runtime limits, model size restrictions), the theory-practice loop breaks. The paper notes using "checkpoints and lightweight frameworks" and efficient models (DistilGPT-2, Phi-2) to mitigate this.

### Mechanism 3: Collaborative Projects With Professional Software Engineering Practices
- Claim: Requiring GitHub workflows, code reviews, and project management in group projects improves both technical skills and industry readiness.
- Mechanism: Group projects (40% of grade) mandate version control with branching/PRs, peer code review, documentation (README, inline comments), and project boards. Students work in consistent four-person teams across both course parts, building sustained collaboration.
- Core assumption: Industry practices learned in authentic project contexts transfer better to professional settings than practices taught in isolation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section 5.2 details: "Version Control and Collaboration requires students to use GitHub for all project work, including branch creation, pull request workflows, and systematic code review processes."
  - [section] Section 6.1 states: "Student feedback indicates enhanced confidence for industry positions that increasingly require familiarity with both established ML methodologies and contemporary LLM technologies."
  - [corpus] No empirical validation in neighboring papers; this is reported perception-based outcome, not measured skill transfer.
- Break condition: If teams have severe skill imbalances, professional practices may not emerge—stronger students may dominate. Section 7 notes using "skills assessment survey" for strategic group formation to balance complementary strengths.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Python Programming Fundamentals**
  - Why needed here: All course materials use Google Colab notebooks requiring Python fluency. Students implement logistic regression, neural networks, and Hugging Face pipelines directly in code.
  - Quick check question: Can you write a Python function that loads a CSV file, filters rows based on a condition, and computes summary statistics?

- **Concept: Basic Probability and Statistics**
  - Why needed here: Part 1 modules cover model evaluation (ROC curves, confusion matrices, cross-validation) and data exploration requiring statistical reasoning about distributions and relationships.
  - Quick check question: Given a dataset with binary classification labels, how would you interpret precision vs. recall trade-offs?

- **Concept: Linear Algebra Fundamentals (Vectors, Matrices, Dot Products)**
  - Why needed here: Neural network modules in Part 1 and transformer attention mechanisms in Part 2 require understanding matrix operations, embeddings, and vector similarity.
  - Quick check question: If you have two embedding vectors, what does their dot product represent in terms of similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
Part 1: Foundational ML (7 weeks)
├── Module 1: Data Science Fundamentals (Titanic dataset)
├── Module 2: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
├── Module 3: Model Development & Evaluation
└── Module 4: Neural Networks (feedforward, CNN, RNN)

├── Module 6: Platforms & Tools (Hugging Face, LangChain)
├── Module 7: Prompt Engineering & RAG
├── Module 8: Model Deployment (Gradio, FastAPI)
└── Module 9: Fine-tuning (LoRA, parameter-efficient)

Assessment Layer
├── Individual Assignments: 40% (9 assignments, one per topic)

├── Participation: 10%
└── Peer Evaluation: 10%

Technical Infrastructure
└── Google Colab notebooks (cloud-based, no local GPU required)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Students must complete Modules 1-3 (data handling, features, model evaluation) before Part 2—LLM work assumes this foundation.
  2. Module 4 (neural networks) directly connects to Module 5 (transformers)—this is the key bridge point the paper emphasizes.
  3. Module 7 (RAG) requires understanding both retrieval concepts and prompt engineering; it synthesizes multiple prior modules.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Colab accessibility vs. model scale:** Free Colab tiers limit work with large models. The course uses efficient models (DistilGPT-2, Phi-2, quantized LLaMA-3.1) rather than full-scale production models. Tradeoff: students learn techniques but not full-scale deployment realities.
  - **Breadth vs. depth:** Covering both traditional ML and LLMs in 14 weeks limits depth in either. The paper claims this is addressable through "enduring fundamental concepts" but acknowledges tradeoffs.
  - **Consistent teams vs. exposure diversity:** Keeping same 4-person teams across both parts builds collaboration depth but limits network effects from working with different partners.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Conceptual integration failure:** Students treat Part 1 and Part 2 as unrelated courses. Signal: final projects don't combine paradigms; students default to either traditional ML or LLM approaches rather than selecting based on problem fit.
  - **Resource constraint blocking:** Students cannot complete Colab exercises due to runtime limits. Signal: incomplete notebooks, students skipping implementation-heavy modules.
  - **Team dynamics collapse:** Peer evaluation reveals collaboration breakdowns. Signal: uneven contribution patterns, conflict in peer evaluations, one-person carry on group projects.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Pre/post conceptual mapping assessment:** Before and after the explicit bridging exercises (Section 7), test students on their ability to explain connections between feature engineering and prompt engineering. Validates Mechanism 1.
  2. **Within-subject A/B on implementation timing:** For one module, have half the cohort implement immediately after theory and half implement a week later. Compare retention and project application. Validates Mechanism 2.
  3. **Industry readiness mock interview:** At course end, have external industry practitioners blind-interview students from this course vs. traditional ML-only courses, rating readiness for LLM-related tasks. Validates the claimed industry preparation outcome.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What assessment methods can effectively evaluate students' ability to select between traditional ML approaches and LLM-based solutions for given problems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work will focus on...developing more sophisticated assessment methods for evaluating students' technology selection and application skills"
- Why unresolved: Current assessment focuses on individual technique mastery and project completion, not comparative technology selection reasoning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validated rubrics or testing instruments that measure decision-making rationale, tested across multiple cohorts with inter-rater reliability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does integrated ML-LLM curriculum produce better industry readiness outcomes compared to traditional separate courses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims enhanced industry readiness but provides no comparative data against control groups or graduates from traditional curricula.
- Why unresolved: No longitudinal tracking or comparison with students from conventional separate ML and NLP courses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study measuring job placement rates, employer satisfaction, and on-the-job performance between integrated and traditional curriculum graduates.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the two-part integrated design perform across different institutional contexts, class sizes, and semester formats?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Implementation occurred at a single institution as an intensive summer course; generalizability to larger classes or full-semester formats remains untested.
- Why unresolved: Limited to one delivery context with no multi-institutional replication.
- What evidence would resolve it: Replication studies across diverse institutions, varying class sizes, and different term structures with comparable learning outcome measurements.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are optimal strategies for integrating multimodal AI concepts within existing computational and time constraints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Multimodal Model Integration will expand coverage to include models that combine text, image, and audio capabilities...This expansion will require developing new assessment methods and project frameworks"
- Why unresolved: Resource constraints already challenge LLM coverage; multimodal models compound computational demands.
- What evidence would resolve it: Pilot implementations testing various multimodal integration approaches with student performance and resource utilization metrics.

## Limitations

- **Limited empirical validation:** The paper reports student feedback and perceived industry readiness but lacks controlled comparisons against alternative course designs or quantitative measures of learning outcomes.
- **Context-specific implementation:** The course design's success depends heavily on institutional resources (Google Colab access, GPU availability), student prerequisites, and instructor expertise.
- **Resource constraint trade-offs:** Using quantized models and free Colab tiers limits exposure to production-scale LLMs, potentially not preparing students for real-world deployment challenges.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The pedagogical value of integrating theory-practice activities within modules and the benefits of explicit conceptual bridging through mapping exercises.
- **Medium confidence:** The effectiveness of professional software practices (GitHub workflows, code reviews) in improving industry readiness.
- **Low confidence:** The overall superiority of this two-part design compared to alternative approaches (sequential traditional-then-LLM courses, integrated ML-LLM curricula, or industry-focused bootcamps).
