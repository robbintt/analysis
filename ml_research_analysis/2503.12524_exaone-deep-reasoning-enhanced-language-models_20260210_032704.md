# EXAONE Deep: Reasoning Enhanced Language Models

## Quick Facts

- EXAONE Deep is a series of reasoning-enhanced language models (2.4B, 7.8B, 32B) fine-tuned on specialized datasets incorporating long streams of thought processes

## Executive Summary
EXAONE Deep is a series of reasoning-enhanced language models developed by LG AI Research, featuring three sizes: 2.4B, 7.8B, and 32B parameters. These models are trained using a comprehensive pipeline that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) on curated datasets totaling 1.6M instances for SFT, 20K for DPO, and 10K for Online RL. The training methodology incorporates long reasoning chains and incorporates safety measures through filtered datasets. EXAONE Deep demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities across multiple benchmarks, outperforming comparable models and showing competitive performance against leading open-weight reasoning models like QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.

## Method Summary
EXAONE Deep models are developed through a multi-stage training pipeline that begins with a base language model pre-trained on a massive web corpus. The models undergo Supervised Fine-Tuning using a carefully curated dataset of 1.6M instances that incorporate long reasoning chains, followed by Direct Preference Optimization on 20K preference pairs, and finally Online Reinforcement Learning on 10K instances. The training incorporates synthetic data generation, curated datasets from existing reasoning models, and safety filtering through Google's Perspective API. The models are evaluated across diverse benchmarks including mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME), coding (LiveCodeBench), and academic tasks (GPQA Diamond), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in reasoning capabilities.

## Key Results
- EXAONE Deep 2.4B outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B on reasoning benchmarks
- EXAONE Deep 7.8B outperforms comparable models and OpenAI o1-mini on multiple tasks
- EXAONE Deep 32B demonstrates competitive performance against leading open-weight reasoning models like QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The EXAONE Deep series achieves superior reasoning capabilities through its comprehensive training methodology that combines multiple fine-tuning approaches. The integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning with curated reasoning datasets provides strong foundational reasoning skills, while Direct Preference Optimization refines these capabilities by aligning outputs with human preferences. The Online Reinforcement Learning stage further enhances the models' ability to generate coherent and effective reasoning chains. The use of long context windows (up to 32K tokens) allows the models to maintain and process extended reasoning processes, while the incorporation of safety measures ensures responsible deployment. The multi-stage training pipeline, combined with carefully curated datasets and synthetic data generation, enables the models to develop robust reasoning capabilities across diverse domains.

## Foundational Learning
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Why needed - Provides initial reasoning capabilities through exposure to curated reasoning datasets; Quick check - Verify model can follow basic reasoning chains on benchmark datasets
- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: Why needed - Refines reasoning outputs to align with human preferences and quality standards; Quick check - Evaluate preference alignment on curated preference pairs
- **Online Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - Enhances reasoning capabilities through iterative feedback and reward signals; Quick check - Measure improvement in reasoning quality after RL fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Base Model -> Supervised Fine-Tuning -> Direct Preference Optimization -> Online Reinforcement Learning -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**
The critical path follows the sequential training stages: base model initialization, SFT fine-tuning on 1.6M instances, DPO refinement on 20K pairs, and Online RL optimization on 10K instances, culminating in comprehensive benchmark evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs**
The architecture prioritizes reasoning capabilities over raw computational efficiency, with larger models (32B) showing superior performance but requiring more resources. The multi-stage training approach balances computational cost with performance gains, while the use of synthetic data reduces reliance on expensive human annotation. Safety filtering adds computational overhead but ensures responsible deployment. The long context windows enable complex reasoning but increase memory requirements and inference costs.

**Failure Signatures**
Models may struggle with out-of-distribution reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring domain-specific knowledge not covered in training data. Performance degradation may occur on tasks requiring extremely long reasoning chains or those involving ambiguous problem statements. Safety filtering may introduce biases or limitations in certain reasoning scenarios. The models may exhibit overconfidence in incorrect reasoning paths, particularly when trained primarily on synthetic data.

**3 First Experiments**
1. Evaluate baseline performance on MATH-500 benchmark before any fine-tuning to establish foundation
2. Test reasoning capability after each training stage (SFT, DPO, Online RL) to measure incremental improvements
3. Assess safety compliance and content filtering effectiveness using perspective API metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on academic and coding tasks, with limited assessment of real-world deployment scenarios
- Training methodology relies on synthetic reasoning data and curated datasets, potentially introducing biases
- Limited assessment of long-context applications and performance in extended reasoning scenarios

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The model architecture and training methodology are well-documented, and the benchmark results are reproducible using standard evaluation protocols.

**Medium confidence**: Performance comparisons with OpenAI o1-mini and other leading models are based on publicly available benchmarks, but may not capture all aspects of reasoning capability.

**Medium confidence**: The claim of "superior reasoning capabilities" is supported by benchmark results but requires further validation across diverse real-world applications.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive human evaluation studies to assess the quality and coherence of reasoning processes across different domains beyond mathematical and coding tasks.

2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and Online Reinforcement Learning to final performance.

3. Evaluate model robustness and generalization by testing on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks and measuring performance degradation when confronted with adversarial examples or ambiguous problem statements.
