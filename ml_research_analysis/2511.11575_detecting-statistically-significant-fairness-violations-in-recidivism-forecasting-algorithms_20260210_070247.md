# Detecting Statistically Significant Fairness Violations in Recidivism Forecasting Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11575
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11575
- Authors: Animesh Joshi
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Most ML models show statistically significant bias against Black individuals in recidivism prediction across multiple fairness metrics

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical challenge of detecting statistically significant fairness violations in recidivism forecasting algorithms through a rigorous k-fold cross-validation framework. Using a 250,000 observation dataset from the National Institute of Justice, the research trains four machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) to forecast recidivism outcomes. The study evaluates multiple fairness definitions including group fairness, predictive parity, predictive equality, equalized odds, conditional use accuracy equality, overall accuracy equality, treatment equality, calibration, and causal discrimination.

The results reveal substantial evidence of algorithmic bias, with most models exhibiting statistically significant unfairness against Black individuals across multiple fairness metrics, achieving accuracy rates between 65.6% and 73.7%. Notably, some models also demonstrate reverse discrimination against White individuals under certain fairness definitions, highlighting the complexity and potential contradictions inherent in different fairness metrics. The study emphasizes the importance of rigorous statistical testing in evaluating algorithmic fairness, as different fairness definitions can lead to contradictory conclusions about bias presence and direction.

## Method Summary
The study employs k-fold cross-validation to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics, enabling statistical inference for fairness evaluation. Four machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) are trained on a 250,000 observation dataset from the National Institute of Justice to forecast recidivism outcomes. The framework tests multiple fairness definitions including group fairness, predictive parity, predictive equality, equalized odds, conditional use accuracy equality, overall accuracy equality, treatment equality, calibration, and causal discrimination. Statistical significance is determined by comparing observed fairness metric values against their sampling distributions generated through cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Most ML models show statistically significant bias against Black individuals across multiple fairness metrics
- Accuracy ranges from 65.6% to 73.7% across different algorithms
- Some models demonstrate reverse discrimination against White individuals under certain fairness definitions
- Different fairness metrics lead to contradictory conclusions about algorithmic bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The k-fold cross-validation approach generates robust sampling distributions of fairness metrics by repeatedly partitioning the data and evaluating model performance across different subsets. This enables statistical inference by establishing confidence intervals for fairness metrics under the null hypothesis of no discrimination. The framework's power comes from its ability to detect subtle fairness violations that might be missed by point-estimate comparisons, while accounting for the inherent variability in model performance across different data partitions.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Group Fairness** - Ensures equal outcomes across demographic groups
   - Why needed: Provides baseline metric for detecting demographic disparities
   - Quick check: Calculate acceptance rates across protected groups

2. **Predictive Parity** - Equal precision across groups
   - Why needed: Ensures false positive rates are balanced across demographics
   - Quick check: Compare positive predictive values between groups

3. **Equalized Odds** - Equal true/false positive rates across groups
   - Why needed: Balances both Type I and Type II error rates across demographics
   - Quick check: Evaluate TPR and FPR consistency across protected groups

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Fairness Metric Calculation -> Statistical Testing -> Result Aggregation

**Critical Path:** The core pipeline involves: 1) Data partitioning via k-fold cross-validation, 2) Model training and prediction on each fold, 3) Fairness metric computation across all folds, 4) Statistical testing against sampling distributions, and 5) Aggregation of results to determine significant violations.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes statistical rigor over computational efficiency, requiring multiple model trainings per algorithm. The choice of k-fold cross-validation provides better variance estimation than simple train-test splits but increases computational cost. The framework's flexibility in testing multiple fairness definitions comes at the cost of increased complexity in interpretation.

**Failure Signatures:** Statistical insignificance may mask real-world discrimination if the sample size is too small or if the fairness metric doesn't capture the relevant type of bias. Conversely, false positives may occur when random variation creates apparent disparities that don't reflect systematic bias.

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate statistical significance thresholds by permuting protected attributes
2. Compare results across different k-fold values (5, 10, 20)
3. Test sensitivity to data preprocessing choices (imputation, scaling)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on historical arrest data may reflect systemic biases in law enforcement
- Binary treatment of race oversimplifies complex racial dynamics in the justice system
- Does not account for intersectionality effects across multiple protected attributes

## Confidence
- Statistical methodology: High
- Real-world implications: Medium
- Model generalizability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate analysis using alternative data sources with different collection methodologies
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying k-fold parameters and bootstrap sampling
3. Extend framework to test intersectional fairness across multiple protected attributes simultaneously
