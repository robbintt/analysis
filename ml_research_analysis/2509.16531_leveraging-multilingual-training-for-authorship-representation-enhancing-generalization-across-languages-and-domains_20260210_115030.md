# Leveraging Multilingual Training for Authorship Representation: Enhancing Generalization across Languages and Domains

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.16531
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16531
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Multilingual model outperforms monolingual baselines in 21 of 22 non-English languages, with average Recall@8 improvement of 4.85%

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multilingual authorship representation (AR) model trained across 36 languages to improve generalization. The method introduces probabilistic content masking (PCM) to focus on stylistic cues over topic-based features, and language-aware batching (LAB) to reduce cross-lingual interference during contrastive learning. Trained on over 4.5 million authors, the multilingual model outperforms monolingual baselines in 21 of 22 non-English languages, with an average Recall@8 improvement of 4.85% and up to 15.91% in low-resource languages. It also generalizes better to unseen languages and domains. Ablation studies confirm PCM and LAB's effectiveness, and downstream evaluations on authorship verification and machine-generated text detection further validate the model's robustness.

## Method Summary
The model uses XLM-RoBERTa-large as the base encoder with probabilistic content masking (PCM) that randomly masks 20% of content tokens identified by frequency heuristics. Language-aware batching (LAB) groups same-language documents in contrastive learning batches to reduce cross-lingual interference. The supervised contrastive loss with temperature scaling (τ=0.1) trains the model on 4.5 million authors across 36 languages. The model is evaluated on seen and unseen languages, domains, and downstream tasks including authorship verification and machine-generated text detection.

## Key Results
- Multilingual model outperforms monolingual baselines in 21 of 22 non-English languages
- Average Recall@8 improvement of 4.85%, with maximum gain of 15.91% in single language
- Strong negative correlation (R² = 0.4960) between training data size and R@8 improvement
- Outperforms English-only models on unseen languages by 9.17% R@8 on average

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Masking content words probabilistically forces the model to attend to stylistic rather than topical features.
- Mechanism: High-frequency subword tokens are treated as function tokens (stylistic markers). Remaining tokens are randomly masked at ~20% rate, creating data augmentation while preserving some content for stylistic signal capture.
- Core assumption: Authors use function words more consistently than content words across documents, and this consistency transfers across languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "probabilistic content masking, which encourages the model to focus on stylistically indicative words rather than content-specific words"
  - [section 3.3]: "Because authors tend to use function words more consistently than content words across documents... this shift in focus promotes the learning of stylistic, rather than topical, patterns"
  - [corpus]: Cross-lingual phonetic representation work (arxiv 2501.06810) suggests linguistic similarity aids transfer in speech, but this is a different domain—weak direct evidence for AR transfer.
- Break condition: If style relies heavily on content-word choice (e.g., domain-specific jargon), masking may remove genuine stylistic signals.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grouping same-language documents in contrastive batches improves learning by reducing low-signal "easy negatives."
- Mechanism: Cross-lingual document pairs have naturally low similarity due to language differences, yielding negligible gradients. LAB ensures each batch contains same-language documents, providing harder negatives that force style differentiation.
- Core assumption: Cross-lingual pairs are trivially dissimilar because of script/vocabulary differences, not style.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "language-aware batching, which improves contrastive learning by reducing cross-lingual interference"
  - [section 3.2]: "Because their similarity to the anchor is already low, these examples yield negligible gradient updates and offer little training signal"
  - [corpus]: Parallel Scaling Law paper (arxiv 2510.02272) discusses cross-linguistic reasoning but doesn't address batching—weak direct evidence.
- Break condition: If within-language stylistic diversity is too high, harder negatives may still be noisy; if too low, the model learns topic shortcuts within language.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint training across multiple languages enables representation capacity transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: A single shared model learns language-agnostic stylistic patterns. When trained on diverse languages, the model develops universal style representations that generalize even to unseen languages.
- Core assumption: Stylistic features have cross-lingual consistency (e.g., punctuation, sentence length) despite syntactic differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "average Recall@8 improvement of 4.85%, with a maximum gain of 15.91% in a single language"
  - [section 5.1, Figure 2]: "strong negative correlation between the number of training authors and the R@8 improvement" (R² = 0.4960)
  - [corpus]: Language Surgery paper (arxiv 2506.12450) discusses representation alignment in multilingual LLM middle layers—supports plausibility but doesn't directly validate AR transfer.
- Break condition: If style is highly language-specific (e.g., morphological patterns in agglutinative languages), transfer may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contrastive Learning with Temperature Scaling**
  - Why needed here: The entire AR model uses supervised contrastive loss with τ=0.1. Understanding why a lower temperature sharpens the softmax and amplifies hard negatives is essential for debugging LAB.
  - Quick check question: Given a batch with one positive and 511 negatives, what happens to gradient magnitude if τ is increased from 0.1 to 1.0?

- Concept: **Topic vs. Style Disentanglement**
  - Why needed here: AR models risk learning topic shortcuts (authors write about similar topics) rather than genuine style. PCM is the mitigation.
  - Quick check question: Given two cooking documents by different authors, what features would indicate the model learned style vs. topic?

- Concept: **Subword Tokenization Frequency Heuristics**
  - Why needed here: PCM identifies function words via subword frequency, not POS taggers. This design choice is critical for multilingual scalability.
  - Quick check question: In a language with rich morphology (e.g., Turkish), how might subword frequency fail to distinguish function from content tokens?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PCM -> XLM-RoBERTa-large -> Mean pooling -> Supervised contrastive loss (τ=0.1) -> LAB batching

- Critical path:
  1. Group documents by author, then by language
  2. Construct batches: shuffle within language, concatenate languages in random order
  3. Apply PCM → encode → pool → compute contrastive loss
  4. Select checkpoint by validation loss (not accuracy)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 20% masking rate: Higher rates preserve less stylistic content; lower rates leak topic. Found optimal via search.
  - XLM-RoBERTa vs. language-specific BERT: Broader coverage but weaker per-language tokenization. Multilingual XLM-RoBERTa outperforms monolingual BERT on 6/8 languages despite no language-specific tokenization.
  - Batch size 1,024: Large batches needed for contrastive diversity; memory-intensive.

- Failure signatures:
  - Mixed-language batches: R@8 barely improves on seen languages
  - PCM not applied: Large performance gap between seen and unseen domains
  - Low-resource collapse: No improvement on languages with <500 authors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate PCM:** Train without PCM on English-only data. Compare seen vs. unseen domain R@8. Expected: baseline 22.60/14.64, PCM 24.66/16.24 (Table 1).
  2. **Ablate LAB:** Train with random batching. Compare multilingual R@8. Expected: LAB improves seen languages from 49.82 to 56.01 (Table 2).
  3. **Zero-shot transfer:** Evaluate on held-out languages (German, Spanish). Compare multilingual vs. English-only. Expected: +9.17% R@8 on unseen languages (Figure 3).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can accurate authorship attribution be performed for individual authors who write in multiple languages using a single shared representation model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section: "whether accurate authorship attribution for authors writing in multiple languages is possible with our model remains unclear."
- Why unresolved: The current experimental setup explicitly restricts training and evaluation to authors who write in only one language, thereby segregating language-specific stylistic features rather than modeling cross-lingual consistency within a single author.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation on a dataset comprising authors with documents in multiple languages (e.g., a single author writing in both English and Spanish) to test if the model maps these documents to the same embedding space.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do stochastic variants of language-specific masking strategies (such as stopword or part-of-speech masking) outperform the proposed frequency-based Probabilistic Content Masking (PCM)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] In the ablation study, the authors note: "We hypothesize that stochastic variants of these approaches could improve performance... however, we leave this exploration to future work."
- Why unresolved: The deterministic masking baselines (Stopword, POS) failed because they created a train-test mismatch, but the authors did not test whether adding randomness to these language-specific methods would improve upon the language-agnostic PCM.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative ablation study implementing stochastic POS-based or stopword-based masking on the same multilingual corpus to compare Recall@8 against the frequency-based PCM.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Language-Aware Batching (LAB) technique be extended to specifically enhance cross-domain generalization alongside language consistency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion lists "extending LAB to enhance cross-domain generalization" as a primary future direction.
- Why unresolved: LAB was designed to reduce cross-lingual "easy negatives" by grouping same-language examples, but it was not optimized or tested for its ability to group same-domain examples from different languages to improve domain robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using a "Domain-Aware Batching" strategy or a hybrid batching method, measuring performance improvements on unseen domains compared to the standard LAB approach.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Does training on a broader range of non-English domains significantly improve the robustness and cross-domain generalization of the multilingual model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly list "incorporating a broader range of domains into the multilingual author-labeled dataset" as a future direction, while acknowledging the current limitation that "our multilingual dataset is sourced from a single domain: Wikipedia."
- Why unresolved: The current model's cross-domain generalization claims are based primarily on English data (which has diverse domains); the non-English capabilities are constrained by the lack of domain diversity in the training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training the model on a multi-domain non-English corpus (e.g., social media, news, and reviews in French or Russian) and evaluating the resulting performance drop on unseen domains.

## Limitations
- Language coverage bias: Model improvements mostly observed in mid-resource languages, not truly low-resource ones
- Domain generalization: "Unseen domain" evaluation may not represent true domain shift
- Style vs. topic disentanglement: Limited quantitative analysis of what features the model actually learns

## Confidence
- **Multilingual training improves generalization across languages**: High - Supported by consistent R@8 improvements across 21/22 non-English languages
- **PCM successfully forces focus on stylistic rather than topical features**: Medium - Ablation study shows PCM improves performance, but mechanism remains partially speculative
- **LAB reduces cross-lingual interference in contrastive learning**: High - Strong empirical support with clear performance degradation when LAB is removed
- **The model generalizes to unseen languages**: Medium - Zero-shot transfer results show improvements, but test set is small (3 languages)
- **Downstream task performance validates the representations**: High - Authorship verification and machine-generated text detection results provide external validation

## Next Checks
1. **Feature Attribution Study**: Conduct gradient-based attribution analysis on held-out examples to quantify what percentage of important features are function words vs. content words, and whether these attributions change across languages.

2. **True Low-Resource Language Test**: Evaluate the model on languages with fewer than 100 training authors to test the claimed benefits for genuinely resource-poor languages, including languages from different families than those in training.

3. **Cross-Domain Robustness Benchmark**: Design an evaluation suite testing the model on systematically varied text types within the same language (academic papers, news articles, social media, code documentation) to quantify domain generalization beyond dataset-level evaluation.
