# Neural Risk-sensitive Satisficing in Contextual Bandits

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.08612
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08612
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: NeuralRS achieves lower regret than NeuralUCB and NeuralTS on artificial and Statlog-Shuttle datasets using kNN-based reliability estimation.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Neural Risk-sensitive Satisficing (NeuralRS), an algorithm that extends RegLinRS by incorporating neural networks for contextual bandit problems. NeuralRS addresses limitations in RegLinRS where linear approximation restricts handling non-linear relationships between features and expected rewards. The algorithm uses neural networks as function approximators for expected reward estimation while maintaining the satisficing framework for switching between exploration and exploitation based on target achievement status. In experiments using both artificial and real-world datasets, NeuralRS demonstrated lower regret compared to benchmark algorithms including NeuralUCB and NeuralTS.

## Method Summary
NeuralRS extends the risk-sensitive satisficing (RS) framework to contextual bandits by replacing linear regression with neural networks. The algorithm computes action values using I^NeuralRS_i = ρ_i(f_i(x_t; θ_{t-1}) - ℵ), where ρ_i is reliability estimated via k-means centroids in the neural network's latent space, f_i is the expected reward from the neural network, and ℵ is an aspiration level. The neural network is trained online via MSE loss, and centroids are updated using weighted averages with decay. The algorithm switches between exploration and exploitation based on whether the target aspiration level is achieved, with under-achieved targets promoting optimistic exploration and over-achieved targets promoting pessimistic exploitation.

## Key Results
- NeuralRS achieves lower cumulative regret than NeuralUCB and NeuralTS on both artificial and Statlog-Shuttle datasets
- kNN-based reliability estimation outperforms k-means, cross-entropy, and trial ratio methods
- k-means reliability offers computational efficiency advantages for large-scale applications despite slightly higher regret
- NeuralRS demonstrates particular effectiveness for real-world applications where exploration costs are high

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Target-driven exploration-exploitation switching reduces cumulative regret when exploration is costly.
- Mechanism: The value function I^NeuralRS_i = ρ_i(f_i(x_t; θ_{t-1}) - ℵ) computes action values by multiplying reliability (ρ_i) by the gap between expected reward and aspiration level (ℵ). When E_i < ℵ (target under-achieved), low-reliability actions receive optimistic encouragement. When E_i ≥ ℵ (target satisfied), high-reliability actions trigger exploitation, suppressing further exploration.
- Core assumption: The aspiration level ℵ is set appropriately for the domain; setting ℵ too high or too low may cause over-exploration or premature convergence.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "switches between exploration and exploitation based on target achievement status"; [section 3.2] "RS promotes optimistic exploration for actions with a low trial ratio ni/N in cases where Ei < ℵ (under-achieved). Conversely, it promotes pessimistic exploitation for actions with a high trial ratio ni/N in cases where Ei ≥ ℵ (over-achieved)."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Neural network function approximation captures non-linear feature-reward relationships that linear models miss.
- Mechanism: A multi-layer network with ReLU activations transforms the d-dimensional feature vector x_t through L hidden layers, outputting expected reward estimates f_i(x_t; θ_{t-1}) for each action. The network is trained online via MSE loss L(θ) = 1/2 Σ[fi(x_t; θ_{t-1}) - r_t]².
- Core assumption: The neural network has sufficient capacity and training data to approximate the true reward function; online training with small batches does not cause catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "replacing linear regression with neural networks to better handle complex feature-reward relationships"; [section 6.1] "The NN used in NeuralRS takes a d-dimensional feature vector xt as input at each time step, applies non-linear transformations through hidden layers."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Latent-space k-means centroids provide computationally efficient reliability estimation for large-scale applications.
- Mechanism: Instead of kNN's O(n) lookup, NeuralRS maintains M centroids per action in the penultimate-layer latent space. The trial ratio ρ_i = softmax(n_i) is computed from weighted selection counts, where weights wi,m = 1/(di,m + ε) depend on Euclidean distance from centroids.
- Core assumption: The latent representation z_t preserves task-relevant structure for clustering; centroids initialized via N(0, σ²I) adequately cover the feature space.
- Evidence anchors: [section 6.2] "The latent representation used for the approximation is taken from the output of the penultimate layer of the NN"; [section 9] "k-means centroids capture overall trends in the feature space more effectively... low computational cost of k-means-based reliability estimation makes it suitable for systems that require real-time processing."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Contextual Bandits**
  - Why needed here: NeuralRS operates in the contextual bandit setting where an agent selects actions based on feature vectors x_t and receives scalar rewards r_t = h(x_t) + ε_t, without state transitions.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why contextual bandits differ from full reinforcement learning (no state transitions)?

- Concept: **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is a satisficing-based alternative to UCB/Thompson Sampling for balancing this trade-off.
  - Quick check question: What happens if an algorithm always exploits (selects the currently best-known action)?

- Concept: **K-means Clustering**
  - Why needed here: NeuralRS estimates reliability via k-means centroids in latent space; understanding centroid initialization, distance metrics, and online updates is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does k-means assign points to clusters, and what is the computational complexity per query?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input feature vector x_t -> Neural Network (2-layer MLP with ReLU) -> Expected rewards f_i and latent representation z_t -> Reliability module (M centroids per action) -> Value function I_i = ρ_i(f_i - ℵ) -> Action selection via argmax

- Critical path:
  1. Receive feature x_t
  2. Forward pass through NN → expected rewards f_i and latent z_t
  3. Compute distances to centroids → reliability ρ_i
  4. Compute value I^NeuralRS_i = ρ_i(f_i - ℵ)
  5. Select action, observe reward r_t
  6. Update NN weights via MSE gradient
  7. Update centroids via weighted average with decay γ

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **kNN vs. k-means reliability**: kNN achieves lower regret (Figure 4-5); k-means offers O(M) vs. O(n) complexity for large-scale deployment
  - **Centroid count M**: Higher M improves coverage but increases memory and computation
  - **Aspiration level ℵ**: Critical hyperparameter; paper uses ℵ = 0.65 for experiments

- Failure signatures:
  - Regret does not decrease after initial exploration phase → ℵ may be misconfigured
  - Action selection collapses to single action → reliability estimates may be degenerate (check centroid initialization)
  - NN loss diverges → learning rate or batch size may be inappropriate

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Sanity check**: Run NeuralRS on the artificial dataset (linear rewards) with kNN reliability; confirm regret decreases monotonically
  2. **Ablation**: Compare k-means vs. kNN vs. Trial Ratio reliability on Statlog-Shuttle; verify kNN outperforms others
  3. **Hyperparameter sweep**: Vary ℵ ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7} and observe regret sensitivity; identify stable operating range

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does k-means-based reliability estimation outperform kNN-based methods on large-scale, noisy, and complex datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Our future works will include evaluating k-means-based reliability estimation on large, noisy, and complex datasets to confirm its practicality."
- Why unresolved: Current experiments (10,000 steps, 100 simulations) on Statlog-Shuttle showed kNN performed best; k-means underperformed despite theoretical advantages for capturing global feature-space trends.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparison on datasets with significantly larger scale, higher noise levels, and more complex feature-reward relationships, demonstrating k-means achieving lower regret than kNN.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can NeuralRS achieve provable finite regret guarantees similar to RegLinRS in K-armed bandit settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes RS "has been proven to keep regret finite in the K-armed bandit problems" and RegLinRS extends this, but no theoretical guarantees are provided for NeuralRS despite its empirical success.
- Why unresolved: Introducing neural network function approximation and k-means centroid updates complicates theoretical analysis; the paper only provides empirical validation without formal regret bounds.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical proof establishing regret bounds for NeuralRS, or counterexamples showing scenarios where regret is unbounded.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the aspiration level ℵ interact with dataset characteristics and neural network capacity to affect NeuralRS performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The aspiration level was fixed at ℵ=0.65 (Table 1) and described as the optimal value for the artificial dataset (ℵ=0.7), but no analysis addresses how to systematically select ℵ for new domains.
- Why unresolved: The satisficing framework depends critically on ℵ for exploration-exploitation switching, yet the paper provides no guidance on adaptive or domain-specific ℵ selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying ℵ across datasets with different reward distributions, or development of an adaptive ℵ selection mechanism with empirical validation.

## Limitations
- NeuralRS performance depends critically on proper ℵ calibration, which lacks theoretical guidance and varies across domains
- k-means reliability estimation may degrade in highly multi-modal feature spaces when modes exceed centroid capacity
- The comparative advantage over state-of-the-art neural bandit algorithms is not thoroughly established

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The neural network architecture and online learning procedure are well-specified and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The satisficing framework's effectiveness depends heavily on proper ℵ tuning, which varies across domains and lacks theoretical bounds
- **Low confidence**: The comparative advantage of NeuralRS over advanced neural bandit methods is not thoroughly established, as experiments focus on linear baselines

## Next Checks
1. **ℵ Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary ℵ across multiple orders of magnitude on both datasets to map regret sensitivity and identify optimal operating ranges
2. **Feature Space Coverage**: Test NeuralRS on synthetic data with known multi-modal distributions to quantify k-means reliability breakdown as modes exceed centroid capacity
3. **State-of-the-Art Comparison**: Benchmark against recent neural bandit algorithms (e.g., Neural-GPO, Neural-Epsilon-Greedy) on standard contextual bandit benchmarks to validate claimed advantages
