# Contrastive Analysis of Constituent Order Preferences Within Adverbial Roles in English and Chinese News: A Large-Language-Model-Driven Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.14054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14054
- Authors: Yiran Rex Ma
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLM-based analysis reveals English news favors linear "core information first" narrative mode with post-positioned functional chunks, while Chinese news adopts holistic "background first" mode with pre-positioned functional chunks.

## Executive Summary
This study uses large language models to analyze the distributional preferences of adverbial functional chunks in English and Chinese news corpora. It finds that English news favors a linear "core information first" narrative mode, with functional chunks typically post-positioned, while Chinese news adopts a holistic "background first" mode, with functional chunks often pre-positioned. In SVO structures, both languages show differences in functional chunk distribution, but Chinese demonstrates stronger pre-positioning tendencies, while English shows milder post-positioning preferences. When multiple functional chunks co-occur, both languages display high flexibility, with order adjustments driven by information and pragmatic purposes. The study reveals that word order exhibits both systematic preferences and dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive analysis of English-Chinese information structure.

## Method Summary
The study employed GPT-4o to annotate comparable English-Chinese news corpora (CROWN2021 and ToRCH2019) with 8 functional chunk types plus S/V/O tags. Parallel annotation runs achieved >0.95 agreement. Statistical analysis included chi-square tests for positional distributions, conditional probability calculations for FC-SVO patterns, and Markov transition matrices for co-occurring chunk sequences. Corpus sizes were 2,649 English lines and 1,735 Chinese lines.

## Key Results
- English news shows systematic preference for post-positioning functional chunks, while Chinese news favors pre-positioning
- Both languages display high flexibility in ordering multiple co-occurring functional chunks
- SVO combinations show statistically significant differences between languages in functional chunk distribution
- Markov transition analysis reveals preferred sequential patterns (e.g., <place>→<manner> in Chinese at 0.55 probability)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based annotation can scale functional chunk labeling across large corpora with acceptable consistency for aggregate statistical analysis.
- Mechanism: GPT-4o receives few-shot prompts with labeled examples for 8 functional chunk types plus S/V/O tags. Parallel annotation runs simulate dual-annotator setup, achieving >0.95 agreement.
- Core assumption: LLM annotation errors are random and cancel out at macro-level; systematic biases are mitigated by few-shot examples.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language Model (LLM)" [section 3.2] "employs the GPT-4o model API... incorporates a few-shot prompting strategy... agreement rate exceeding 0.95"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Constituent order preferences emerge as statistically significant deviations from uniform distribution, detectable via chi-square tests and conditional probability.
- Mechanism: For each functional chunk type, chi-square tests compare observed sentence-internal positions against uniform distribution. Conditional probability calculates P(FC before S|FC exists). Significant deviations indicate entrenched preferences.
- Core assumption: Uniform distribution is a meaningful null hypothesis; corpus is representative of journalistic register.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "English news prefers linear narrative of core information first... while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of background first" [section 4.1] "chi-square tests were conducted for each type of functional chunk... functional chunks exhibit an overall significant tendency for fronting [in Chinese]"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Markov chain transition matrices capture sequential tendencies between co-occurring functional chunks, revealing flexible vs. rigid ordering patterns.
- Mechanism: Transition probability P(FC_b|FC_a) calculated from observed sequences. High-probability transitions indicate preferred orderings; low uniformity indicates flexibility.
- Core assumption: Sequential dependencies are adequately captured by first-order Markov assumption; higher-order dependencies are negligible.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.3] "we conducted an analysis of the conditional transition probabilities between functional chunks... constructed transition matrix heatmaps" [section 4.3] "in Chinese, the highest transition probability is from <place> to <manner>, reaching 0.55... English shows higher transition probabilities from <condition> to <effect> (0.33)"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Functional chunks as annotated units
  - Why needed here: The entire analysis depends on correctly segmenting sentences into <time>, <place>, <manner>, <cause>, <effect>, <condition>, <purpose>, <concession> plus S/V/O.
  - Quick check question: Given "The White House announced sanctions on Friday night for its forced landing of a Ryanair flight," can you label each functional role?

- Concept: Chi-square test for distributional deviation
  - Why needed here: Determines whether observed positions (pre-/post-S/V/O) differ significantly from random distribution.
  - Quick check question: If <time> appears 70% pre-verbally in 1,000 sentences, what does χ² test against uniform (50/50) distribution tell you?

- Concept: Conditional probability vs. joint probability
  - Why needed here: P(<time> before <S> | <time> exists) isolates positional tendency from chunk frequency.
  - Quick check question: Why use conditional probability rather than raw co-occurrence counts when comparing English vs. Chinese?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Corpus layer (CROWN2021 + ToRCH2019) -> Annotation layer (GPT-4o API with few-shot prompts) -> Statistical layer (Chi-square tests, conditional probability, Markov matrices) -> Visualization layer (Distribution charts, transition heatmaps, t-SNE embeddings)

- Critical path: 1. Prepare corpus -> 2. Design prompts with 3-shot examples -> 3. Run parallel annotation -> 4. Validate agreement (>0.95) -> 5. Compute positional distributions -> 6. Run chi-square tests per chunk type -> 7. Calculate conditional probabilities and transition matrices -> 8. Cross-linguistic t-tests

- Design tradeoffs: GPT-4o annotation trades cost/speed for human-expert accuracy; acceptable for aggregate patterns, risky for sentence-level claims. First-order Markov trades simplicity for capturing higher-order pragmatic dependencies. t-SNE visualization trades global structure preservation for local cluster visibility.

- Failure signatures: Agreement rate <0.9: prompts likely ambiguous; redesign with clearer chunk definitions. Chi-square p > 0.05 for most chunks: corpus too small or annotation too noisy. Transition probabilities near-uniform (all ~0.125): Markov order insufficient or true flexibility dominates.

- First 3 experiments: 1. Replicate annotation on held-out 10% corpus with human labels; compute precision/recall per chunk type. 2. Increase corpus size 5x; verify whether χ² significance stabilizes for rare chunks (<condition>, <concession>). 3. Test second-order Markov model; check if transition predictive power improves for chunks with discourse-driven ordering.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do the identified "core information first" (English) and "background first" (Chinese) constituent order preferences remain consistent across non-journalistic registers, such as academic writing or spoken discourse?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.1: "Future studies could expand the scope of the corpus and explore other genres to investigate the cross-register consistency and variability of English and Chinese constituent order patterns."
- Why unresolved: Current study limited strictly to comparable news corpora, which may exhibit specific information structural constraints unique to journalism.
- Evidence would resolve it: Replication of study's LLM-driven annotation and statistical analysis on diverse corpora representing other registers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do local semantic nuances and dynamic pragmatic factors drive word order adjustments in cases where the observed distributional preferences are violated?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.2 concludes that while global semantic differences are minimal, "local differences do exist" and embeddings may overlook "dynamic pragmatic factors."
- Why unresolved: Study relied on static high-dimensional embeddings which capture global semantic features but are restricted in representing deep micro-level semantic associations or discourse-level pragmatics.
- Evidence would resolve it: Fine-grained semantic and pragmatic annotation of "outlier" sentences to identify specific semantic features triggering deviations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the potential for prompt-induced bias in the GPT-4o annotation process impact the reliability of the extracted functional chunk distribution patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "Limitations" section lists "Prompt-Induced Bias" and "Annotation Consistency" as methodological challenges.
- Why unresolved: While dual-annotation consistency check was performed, no systematic validation against human gold standard or ablation study on prompt design.
- Evidence would resolve it: Comparative study evaluating LLM annotation accuracy against manually verified gold-standard dataset using varied prompt configurations.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the flexibility observed in multi-functional chunk ordering be systematically predicted by specific information-structural variables, such as topic continuity or focus strength?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 5.3 discusses "Mechanisms of Flexibility," noting adjustments driven by "information and pragmatic purposes."
- Why unresolved: Statistical analysis confirms flexibility exists but does not isolate specific variables determining ordering when multiple chunks co-occur.
- Evidence would resolve it: Multivariate statistical model using information structure features as predictors for chunk sequencing.

## Limitations
- LLM annotation reliability uncertain due to unspecified prompt templates and lack of human validation
- Corpus sizes (2,649 English, 1,735 Chinese lines) may be insufficient for rare chunk types
- First-order Markov assumption may oversimplify pragmatic ordering of co-occurring chunks

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Basic finding that English news favors post-positioning while Chinese news favors pre-positioning for most functional chunks. Supported by multiple chi-square tests (p<0.001) across chunk types.
- **Medium Confidence:** Cross-linguistic differences in SVO combinations and conditional probability patterns. Statistical significance established but LLM annotation introduces potential systematic biases.
- **Low Confidence:** Markov transition matrix findings for co-occurring chunks. First-order Markov assumption may oversimplify pragmatic ordering, and no external validation exists for these sequential patterns.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human annotation validation on 100 randomly selected sentences to establish ground truth for chunk labeling accuracy and identify systematic LLM biases.
2. Test robustness by replicating analysis on a 5x larger subset of the same corpora to verify whether statistical significance stabilizes for rare functional chunks.
3. Implement second-order Markov model analysis to determine if higher-order dependencies significantly improve prediction of co-occurring chunk orderings compared to first-order transitions.
