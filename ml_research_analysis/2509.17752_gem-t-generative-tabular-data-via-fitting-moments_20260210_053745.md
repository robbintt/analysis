## Executive Summary
GEM-T is a lightweight generative model for tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy. Unlike deep neural network approaches, GEM-T fits distributions by matching statistical moments (means, variances, covariances, etc.) of the training data. This results in orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters while achieving strong performance. On 34 diverse benchmark datasets, GEM-T matched or exceeded state-of-the-art deep models in 23 cases (68%). It particularly outperformed competitors on smaller datasets (<10,000 rows) and consistently avoided the severe underperformance sometimes seen in deep models. The approach handles heterogeneous data types well and provides reasonable privacy preservation. Results demonstrate that much of the information in real-world tabular data resides in low-dimensional, interpretable correlations, validating the effectiveness of the MaxEnt principle for synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
GEM-T generates synthetic tabular data by fitting maximum entropy distributions that match statistical moments of the training data. The method involves preprocessing with jittering and quantile transformation to normalize heterogeneous data types, then fitting either 2nd-order (analytical) or 4th-order (gradient descent with MCMC) moment constraints. The energy function is parameterized as a weighted sum of moment features, with weights learned by minimizing the difference between training and model moments. Sampling uses bounded Metropolis-Hastings to avoid artifacts, followed by inverse transformations to restore original data types. The approach achieves orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than deep models while maintaining strong statistical fidelity across diverse datasets.

## Key Results
- Matched or exceeded state-of-the-art deep models in 23/34 benchmark cases (68%)
- Outperformed competitors on smaller datasets (<10,000 rows) with TARGN degrading exponentially (R²=0.79)
- Achieved consistent performance without severe underperformance (0/34 datasets where GEM-T was ≥0.10 worse than best)
- Demonstrated orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters (14-column table: 3,059 for 4th-order vs 203 for 2nd-order)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Moment constraints up to fourth order capture most predictive information in tabular data, enabling lightweight generative models.
- **Mechanism:** GEM-T parameterizes a probability distribution as p(x) = (1/Z)exp(Σᵢλᵢfᵢ(x)) where fᵢ(x) are moment features. The weights λᵢ are learned by minimizing the difference between training data moments and model moments via gradient descent (gradient = ⟨fᵢ⟩real − ⟨fᵢ⟩model).
- **Core assumption:** Most tabular datasets lie on low-dimensional manifolds where pairwise and higher-order correlations encode the essential structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations"
  - [Section 3.3.2] Eq. 3 shows gradient equals moment differences; optimization stops when constraints are satisfied
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—neighbor papers focus on MaxEnt in RL and ecological modeling, not tabular generation
- **Break condition:** When data requires >4th order dependencies or contains complex conditional dependencies not captured by marginal moments (e.g., Academic Success dataset showed poor fit for all models, suggesting data-specific complexity).

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Quantile transformation with jittering normalizes heterogeneous marginals (binary, categorical, continuous) into a common space amenable to moment matching.
- **Mechanism:** Add small random noise to break ties → apply empirical CDF → map to standard normal → scale to zero-mean interval. This "warps" the coordinate system so that lower moments contain more information.
- **Core assumption:** Transforming to normal-like marginals preserves dependence structure while simplifying the fitting problem.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.4.1] Jittering "eliminates identical values, without which the quantile transform can fail"
  - [Figure 2a] Visual demonstration: without jitter, synthetic data fails to match binary distributions; with jitter, successful modeling
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for jittering in MaxEnt; technique appears novel to GEM-T
- **Break condition:** When marginals have complex multimodal structure that quantile transformation cannot adequately regularize, or when jitter magnitude affects discrete value semantics.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Bounded Metropolis-Hastings sampling prevents energy function artifacts (low-energy regions outside training support) while generating valid samples.
- **Mechanism:** Propose new points within Mahalanobis-distance-25 ellipsoid; reflect proposals outside bounds; accept/reject based on energy ratio. Burn-in (200 steps) and thinning (k=25) reduce autocorrelation.
- **Core assumption:** Training data covariance defines a reasonable support region; energy function may have spurious low-energy artifacts for odd-order moments.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [Section 3.4.3] "avoiding low-energy artifacts outside the support of the training data that occur due to the diverging nature of odd-ordered moment terms"
  - [Section 3.4.3] Specifies ellipsoidal bound with Mahalanobis distance squared cutoff = 25
  - [corpus] No corpus evidence; sampling scheme is implementation-specific
- **Break condition:** When data distribution is not approximately ellipsoidal (e.g., multi-cluster, hollow distributions), or when 200-step burn-in is insufficient for chain convergence.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Maximum Entropy Principle**
  - Why needed here: Core theoretical foundation—MaxEnt selects the least-biased distribution matching known constraints (moments), avoiding overfitting.
  - Quick check question: Given only mean and variance of a random variable, what distribution maximizes entropy? (Answer: Gaussian)

- **Concept: Energy-Based Models (EBMs)**
  - Why needed here: GEM-T is an EBM where the energy function is a weighted sum of moment features; understanding this frames the learning objective.
  - Quick check question: How does an EBM define probability from energy? (Answer: p(x) ∝ exp(-E(x)))

- **Concept: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Sampling**
  - Why needed here: Higher-order MaxEnt distributions lack closed-form sampling; MCMC enables drawing samples for gradient estimation and final output.
  - Quick check question: In Metropolis-Hastings, when do you accept a proposed sample? (Answer: With probability min(1, p(x')/p(x)))

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Raw data → [Preprocessor: jitter → quantile transform → scale] → [Fit: 2nd-order (analytical) OR 4th-order (gradient descent + MCMC)] → [Sampler: MH with ellipsoid bounds] → [Inverse transform + coercion] → Synthetic data

- **Critical path:** The 4th-order fit's gradient descent loop: sample → compute moments → compute gradient (Eq. 3) → update weights via Adam-RProp hybrid → repeat until convergence or 6-hour timeout.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - 2nd vs 4th order: 2nd has closed-form solution (fast); 4th captures tails/hard-edges but requires iterative optimization with sampling noise
  - Paper shows 2nd/4th order each win ~50% of the time internally—suggests principled feature subset selection could improve efficiency
  - Parameter count scales O(n⁴) for 4th order with n columns; 14-column table = 3,059 parameters vs. 203 for 2nd order

- **Failure signatures:**
  - All models fail on certain datasets (Academic Success, Dry Bean, Default Credit Card)—look for integer-encoded categories with arbitrary ordering
  - CTGAN/TARGN sometimes score ≥0.10 worse than best (asterisks in Fig 3b); GEM-T never does (0/34)
  - TARGN degrades exponentially on datasets <10,000 rows (R²=0.79)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Smoke test on Iris (150 rows, 5 columns):** Verify 2nd-order fit matches paper benchmark (0.71-0.74 quality score). Small enough to debug preprocessing and sampling end-to-end.
  2. **Compare 2nd vs 4th order on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagonal):** Paper shows 4th order captures correlated integer columns better (Eden score 0.36 vs 0.25). Verify tail-handling improvement.
  3. **Privacy/overfitting check:** Split training data in half, score one half against the other (50 repetitions). Confirm synthetic data falls within this reference range (16/34 datasets in paper). Check DCR ratio ≥ 1.0.

## Limitations
- The exact 4th-order moment feature construction and jitter magnitude scaling are underspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Limited evidence that MaxEnt captures all predictive information in complex tabular data (Academic Success dataset shows systematic underperformance)
- Privacy preservation claims rely on weak statistical tests; no formal differential privacy guarantees provided

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
- The exact 4th-order moment feature construction and jitter magnitude scaling are underspecified, potentially affecting reproducibility
- Limited evidence that MaxEnt captures all predictive information in complex tabular data (Academic Success dataset shows systematic underperformance)
- Privacy preservation claims rely on weak statistical tests; no formal differential privacy guarantees provided

**Confidence Assessment:**
- **High confidence** in GEM-T's lightweight parameter efficiency and superior performance on small datasets (<10,000 rows)
- **Medium confidence** in the general superiority over deep models (68% win rate, but 4th-order moments require careful implementation)
- **Low confidence** in privacy preservation claims and universal applicability to all tabular data types

## Next Checks
1. **Implement and validate the exact 4th-order moment feature construction** by comparing synthetic data statistics against training data moments (target: <0.05 absolute error on all 1D-4D moments)
2. **Test on discrete-heavy datasets** (e.g., Chess, Connect-4) to verify jitter magnitude doesn't distort categorical semantics while enabling quantile transformation
3. **Compare GEM-T privacy preservation** against formal differential privacy baselines by measuring information leakage through gradient analysis
