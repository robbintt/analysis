# Beyond Text: Unveiling Privacy Vulnerabilities in Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.13957
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13957
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** Compositional structured prompt attacks can extract private images and audio transcripts from multimodal RAG systems with up to 73% direct copy success rates

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first systematic study of privacy vulnerabilities in multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MRAG) systems. The authors develop a compositional structured prompt attack method to extract private information from vision-language and speech-language RAG systems in a black-box setting. Their attack combines information retrieval components with content reproduction commands to successfully extract sensitive data. The study demonstrates significant privacy risks in MRAG systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust privacy-preserving techniques.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a compositional structured prompt attack framework specifically designed for MRAG systems. The attack leverages structured prompts that combine information retrieval with content reproduction commands, allowing attackers to extract private information even when the retriever appears to only return public data. The methodology involves crafting prompts that manipulate the RAG pipeline to generate either direct copies of sensitive content or indirect textual descriptions that reveal private information. The approach is tested across both vision-language and speech-language RAG systems using standardized evaluation metrics including MSE for image similarity and Chroma scores for audio comparison.

## Key Results
- Vision-language RAG attacks achieved up to 406 direct image copies (73 unique images) and 499 indirect text extractions (75 unique images)
- Speech-language RAG attacks extracted up to 459 indirect text transcripts (173 unique audios) and generated 410 nearly identical audio copies (146 unique audios)
- The compositional structured prompt approach consistently outperformed baseline attacks across all tested scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The vulnerability stems from the fundamental architecture of MRAG systems where retrieved content is integrated into the generation context. When attackers can manipulate the prompt structure to emphasize content reproduction, the language model tends to reproduce verbatim information from the retrieval context. This occurs because the compositional nature of the prompts creates a strong generation bias toward the retrieved content, effectively bypassing the system's intended safeguards that limit information leakage.

## Foundational Learning
- **MRAG Architecture Components**: Understanding retriever, fusion module, and generator interactions is essential for crafting effective attacks
- **Content Reproduction Mechanisms**: Knowing how language models prioritize and reproduce retrieved content enables targeted prompt engineering
- **Similarity Metrics (MSE/Chroma)**: These quantitative measures are needed to evaluate extraction success across different modalities
- **Black-box Attack Constraints**: Understanding API limitations shapes attack design when internal model access is unavailable
- **Compositional Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts that combine retrieval and reproduction commands are critical for successful exploitation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Retriever -> Context Processor -> Generator -> Output Filter
**Critical Path:** Prompt Input → Retriever → Context Assembly → Generation → Output
**Design Tradeoffs:** Balancing retrieval accuracy against privacy protection; content filtering vs. utility preservation
**Failure Signatures:** High MSE/Chroma scores indicate successful extraction; unexpected content reproduction suggests vulnerability exploitation
**First Experiments:** 1) Baseline vulnerability assessment without attacks, 2) Controlled prompt manipulation tests, 3) Cross-modality transferability evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: What effective defense strategies can mitigate privacy leakage in MRAG systems without degrading the utility of the generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in Section 7 that "developing effective defense strategies based on these mechanisms remain open challenges."
- Why unresolved: The study focused exclusively on quantifying the attack success rates across different modalities rather than proposing or testing mitigation techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: A defense mechanism (e.g., output filtering or retrieval sanitization) that reduces extraction rates (lower MSE/Chroma scores) while maintaining baseline RAG performance benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific internal mechanisms within Large Multimodal Models drive the reproduction of retrieved sensitive data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 identifies the need for a "deeper analysis of the underlying mechanisms driving these vulnerabilities."
- Why unresolved: The research utilized a black-box API setting, which restricted the ability to analyze model internals, attention weights, or circuitry.
- What evidence would resolve it: Interpretability studies mapping specific neural components or attention heads to the model's tendency to reproduce verbatim content from the retrieval context.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the identified privacy vulnerabilities generalize to other data modalities, specifically graph-structured data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 notes the analysis is limited to vision and speech, explicitly leaving "other emerging modalities like GraphRAG unexplored."
- Why unresolved: The compositional attack prompt was tailored for visual and auditory reproduction, which differs structurally from graph data generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Adapting the attack framework to GraphRAG systems and measuring the success rate of extracting private graph structures or node attributes.

## Limitations
- Attack methodology relies on specific prompt engineering techniques that may not generalize across all MRAG architectures
- Evaluation focuses on controlled environments with predetermined private information rather than real-world complexity
- Black-box setting assumes certain system behaviors that might not hold for all deployed MRAG systems

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** The demonstrated vulnerability of MRAG systems to structured prompt attacks is well-supported by empirical results across multiple experimental conditions.
**Medium Confidence:** The generalizability of the attack approach across different MRAG implementations and real-world deployment scenarios.
**Medium Confidence:** The claim that these vulnerabilities necessitate urgent development of privacy-preserving techniques.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Architecture Validation:** Test the compositional structured prompt attack against MRAG systems with different underlying architectures (e.g., varying retriever types, different language model backbones) to assess attack robustness and identify potential system-specific defenses.

2. **Real-World Deployment Assessment:** Evaluate the attack methodology on MRAG systems deployed in actual production environments, including those with potential security hardening measures, to determine practical exploitability and risk levels.

3. **Defense Mechanism Evaluation:** Investigate and test potential mitigation strategies, such as enhanced input sanitization, retrieval result filtering, or adversarial training, to assess their effectiveness against the proposed attack vectors and identify optimal defense approaches.
