core_contribution: This paper introduces a homogenization-based framework for approximating
  the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning agents in a finite-state
  Markov game. The core idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously
  reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, treating the agents'
  parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the fast-mixing game state.

# Homogenization of Multi-agent Learning Dynamics in Finite-state Markov Games

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.21079
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21079
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces a homogenization framework to approximate multi-agent learning dynamics in finite-state Markov games via a deterministic ODE limit.

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a homogenization-based approach to analyze the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning agents in a finite-state Markov game. By simultaneously scaling down the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, the method treats the agents' parameters as slow variables influenced by the fast-mixing game state. Under ergodicity and continuity assumptions, the framework proves convergence to a deterministic ODE, providing a tractable approximation of the averaged learning dynamics. This offers a principled alternative to simulation-heavy analyses in dynamic multi-agent environments.

## Method Summary
The homogenization framework leverages stochastic approximation theory to derive a deterministic ODE approximation for multi-agent learning in finite-state Markov games. The key innovation is the joint rescaling of the learning rate and update frequency, which decouples the fast-mixing state process from the slow evolution of agent parameters. This separation of timescales allows the application of averaging principles, resulting in a tractable ODE that captures the long-term behavior of the learning dynamics averaged over the stationary state distribution.

## Key Results
- Proves convergence of rescaled multi-agent learning dynamics to a deterministic ODE under ergodicity and continuity.
