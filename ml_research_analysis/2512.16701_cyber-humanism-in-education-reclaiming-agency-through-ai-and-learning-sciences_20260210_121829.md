# Cyber Humanism in Education: Reclaiming Agency through AI and Learning Sciences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.16701
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16701
- Authors: Giovanni Adorni
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Introduces Cyber Humanism in Education as a framework for reclaiming human agency in AI-rich learning environments

## Executive Summary
Cyber Humanism in Education is a conceptual framework that addresses epistemic automation and cognitive offloading risks in AI-integrated learning by positioning educators and learners as active epistemic agents and algorithmic citizens. The framework operationalizes three pillars—reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, and dialogic design—through prompt-based learning and a new Conversational AI Educator certification. Case studies across social sciences, digital humanities, and engineering demonstrate how these practices strengthen agency while revealing tensions around workload, equity, and governance.

## Method Summary
This work presents a conceptual framework with emerging empirical support from case studies in social sciences, digital humanities, and engineering. The framework integrates prompt-based learning and a Conversational AI Educator certification within the EPICT ecosystem to operationalize reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, and dialogic design. Implementation involves participatory design with educators and learners to co-design socio-technical infrastructures that maintain human agency in AI-rich environments.

## Key Results
- Positions educators and learners as epistemic agents and algorithmic citizens who co-design socio-technical infrastructures
- Operationalizes three pillars through prompt-based learning and Conversational AI Educator certification
- Case studies show strengthened agency while highlighting tensions around workload, equity, and governance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by shifting from passive AI adoption to active co-design, where humans retain epistemic authority through reflexive competence and algorithmic citizenship. Prompt-based learning serves as the mechanism for maintaining agency by requiring educators to critically frame AI interactions rather than offloading cognitive work. The conversational AI certification ensures educators possess the competencies to guide this process while the dialogic design pillar creates feedback loops between human and machine intelligence that preserve human oversight and intentionality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Epistemic automation**: AI-driven reduction of human judgment in knowledge work; needed to understand risks of cognitive offloading; quick check: identify tasks where AI replaces rather than augments human reasoning
- **Algorithmic citizenship**: Rights and responsibilities in socio-technical systems; needed to frame learner agency in AI environments; quick check: map power dynamics between users and algorithmic systems
- **Dialogic design**: Co-creation of human-AI interaction patterns; needed for sustainable human-machine collaboration; quick check: assess feedback loops in AI-human pedagogical exchanges
- **Prompt-based learning**: Structured AI interaction through carefully crafted prompts; needed to maintain human control over AI outputs; quick check: evaluate prompt quality across different learning contexts
- **Reflexive competence**: Meta-cognitive ability to reflect on one's own learning processes; needed to counter automation bias; quick check: measure self-awareness in AI-mediated learning tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Educators (reflexive competence) -> AI systems (algorithmic citizenship) -> Learning outcomes (dialogic design) -> Certification (prompt-based learning)
- **Critical path**: 1) Assess current AI integration → 2) Implement prompt-based learning modules → 3) Obtain Conversational AI Educator certification → 4) Establish dialogic design feedback loops → 5) Evaluate agency preservation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Full agency preservation vs. efficiency gains; comprehensive certification vs. accessibility; participatory design vs. implementation speed
- **Failure signatures**: Over-reliance on AI outputs, diminished critical thinking, inequitable access to certification resources, institutional resistance to participatory design
- **Three first experiments**: 1) Pilot prompt-based learning in one discipline with pre/post agency measures; 2) Conduct participatory design workshop with mixed stakeholder groups; 3) Implement micro-certification program for algorithmic citizenship awareness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Reliance on voluntary educator adoption without addressing institutional constraints
- Insufficient attention to power asymmetries in algorithmic design and data governance
- Lack of longitudinal data on learner outcomes beyond reflexive competence

## Confidence
- **Theoretical framing and literature integration**: High confidence
- **Pedagogical feasibility claims**: Medium confidence
- **Scalability and governance assertions**: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct randomized controlled trials comparing prompt-based learning with conventional AI integration across disciplines
2. Implement workload impact assessments in diverse institutional contexts (K-12, higher ed, vocational)
3. Develop participatory design workshops with educators and learners to co-evaluate algorithmic citizenship frameworks and identify governance gaps
