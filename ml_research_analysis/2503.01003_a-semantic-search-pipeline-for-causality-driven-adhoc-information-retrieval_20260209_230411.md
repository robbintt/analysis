core_contribution: This paper introduces an unsupervised semantic search pipeline
  for the Causality-driven Adhoc Information Retrieval (CAIR-2021) shared task, which
  requires retrieving documents containing the likely causes of a query event. The
  proposed method aggregates results from three query strategies across a lexical
  index (using Okapi BM25) and a semantic index (using sentence embeddings).

# A Semantic Search Pipeline for Causality-driven Adhoc Information Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.01003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01003
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Proposed semantic search pipeline achieved MAP of 0.5761 and P@5 of 0.7800 on CAIR-2021 test set

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an unsupervised semantic search pipeline for the CAIR-2021 shared task, which focuses on retrieving documents containing likely causes of query events. The approach combines three query strategies across both lexical (Okapi BM25) and semantic (sentence embeddings) indices, aggregating results to improve retrieval of causally relevant documents. The method demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional IR and pure semantic baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the test set with a Mean Average Precision of 0.5761 and Precision at 5 of 0.7800.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs an unsupervised approach that aggregates results from three distinct query strategies across both lexical and semantic search indices. For lexical retrieval, the system uses Okapi BM25 with carefully constructed queries, while for semantic retrieval, it employs sentence embeddings to capture semantic similarity. The three query strategies likely involve variations in query formulation to capture different aspects of causal relationships. Results from both indices are then combined through aggregation to produce the final ranked list of documents. This hybrid approach leverages the precision of keyword matching from lexical search while incorporating the semantic understanding capabilities of embedding-based methods.

## Key Results
- Achieved MAP of 0.5761 and P@5 of 0.7800 on CAIR-2021 test set
- Demonstrated 25% increase in MAP compared to strongest baseline
- Demonstrated 14% increase in P@5 compared to strongest baseline
- Led the CAIR-2021 leaderboard for the shared task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The semantic search pipeline succeeds by effectively bridging the lexical-semantic gap that traditional keyword-based approaches struggle with when identifying causal relationships. While lexical methods like BM25 excel at finding exact term matches, they often miss documents that use different terminology to express the same causal concepts. Semantic search using sentence embeddings captures these conceptual similarities by representing documents and queries in a shared vector space where causally related concepts are positioned closer together. By aggregating results from both approaches, the system captures both precise term matching and semantic similarity, effectively covering different aspects of causal relationships that might be expressed through various linguistic patterns.

## Foundational Learning

### Sentence Embeddings
- Why needed: To capture semantic meaning and relationships between documents and queries beyond exact keyword matching
- Quick check: Verify embeddings produce similar vectors for documents describing the same causal relationship using different wording

### Okapi BM25
- Why needed: To provide precise keyword matching for exact causal term occurrences and serve as a strong lexical baseline
- Quick check: Confirm BM25 scores correlate with presence of explicit causal markers and query terms

### Query Strategy Design
- Why needed: To explore different ways of formulating causal queries that capture various aspects of causal relationships
- Quick check: Test whether different query formulations retrieve complementary sets of documents

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Lexical Index (BM25) <- Query Generator 1 -> Aggregator -> Final Ranking
Semantic Index (Embeddings) <- Query Generator 2 ->
Query Generator 3 ->

### Critical Path
Query generation → Index search (both lexical and semantic) → Result aggregation → Final ranking

### Design Tradeoffs
The unsupervised approach avoids the need for labeled training data but may miss opportunities to learn specific causal patterns. Combining lexical and semantic methods increases computational cost but improves coverage of different causal expression styles. The aggregation strategy must balance the relative strengths of each approach without introducing bias toward one type of retrieval.

### Failure Signatures
- Over-reliance on lexical matching may miss semantically similar but lexically different causal descriptions
- Pure semantic search may retrieve topically related but causally irrelevant documents
- Poor query formulation may fail to capture the directional nature of causal relationships

### First Experiments
1. Test retrieval performance on documents with varying levels of lexical overlap with queries
2. Evaluate semantic search performance on documents using synonyms or paraphrases for causal concepts
3. Compare aggregated results against individual lexical and semantic rankings to identify complementary retrieval patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on single CAIR-2021 dataset limits generalizability to other causality-focused retrieval scenarios
- No detailed error analysis provided to understand which causal relationship types are handled well versus poorly
- Unsupervised approach cannot leverage labeled training data that might improve performance on specific causal relation types

## Confidence

**High**: Observed performance improvements on CAIR-2021 test set are directly measurable from reported MAP and P@5 metrics.

**Medium**: Claim that combining lexical and semantic strategies "effectively identifies causally relevant documents" assumes test set adequately represents real-world causal retrieval scenarios.

**Medium**: "25% increase in MAP" claim requires verification as relative improvement over baseline without access to baseline's exact performance numbers.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation using other causality-focused or temporal information retrieval datasets to assess generalizability beyond CAIR-2021
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of lexical versus semantic components and the three query strategies
3. Execute detailed error analysis categorizing retrieval failures by causal relation types (direct causation, enabling conditions, preconditions, etc.) to identify systematic weaknesses
