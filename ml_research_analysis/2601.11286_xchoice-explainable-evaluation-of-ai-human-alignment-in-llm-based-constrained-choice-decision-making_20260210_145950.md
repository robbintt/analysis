# XChoice: Explainable Evaluation of AI-Human Alignment in LLM-based Constrained Choice Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.11286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11286
- Reference count: 40
- XChoice introduces a mechanism-based framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making

## Executive Summary
XChoice presents a novel framework for evaluating alignment between human and LLM decision-making in constrained choice scenarios. Rather than measuring surface-level agreement on outcomes, the framework estimates interpretable decision parameters from human and LLM choices, capturing how different attributes are weighted and how trade-offs are resolved. Using American daily time allocation data as a test case, XChoice reveals heterogeneous alignment patterns across different activities and demographic groups, with particular misalignment concentrated among Black and married populations. The framework demonstrates that targeted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) interventions can reduce misalignment by providing relevant evidence that addresses specific mechanism gaps.

## Method Summary
XChoice introduces a mechanism-based evaluation framework that estimates interpretable decision parameters from human and LLM choices in constrained decision making. Instead of measuring agreement on outcomes alone, it captures how decision attributes are weighted and how trade-offs are resolved. The framework uses Bayesian parameter estimation to derive decision weights from constrained choice data, then compares these parameters between humans and LLMs. XChoice applies this approach to time allocation decisions using ATUS data, revealing alignment patterns across activities and demographics. The framework includes robustness analysis comparing parameter-based estimates to reduced-form regression approaches, and demonstrates how targeted RAG interventions can reduce misalignment by providing relevant evidence that addresses specific mechanism gaps identified through parameter analysis.

## Key Results
- XChoice reveals heterogeneous alignment across models and activities, with strongest misalignment concentrated in Black and married subgroups
- Robustness analysis shows XChoice estimates are more stable under environmental shifts than reduced-form regressions
- Targeted RAG interventions reduce misalignment by injecting relevant evidence, especially when models exhibit clear mechanism gaps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
XChoice works by moving beyond outcome-level agreement to capture the underlying decision-making mechanisms. By estimating interpretable parameters that represent how attributes are weighted and trade-offs are resolved, the framework can identify specific areas where human and LLM decision processes diverge, even when they arrive at similar outcomes. This mechanistic understanding enables targeted interventions (like RAG) that address the root causes of misalignment rather than just the symptoms.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Mechanism-based alignment evaluation** - Understanding decision processes through interpretable parameters rather than just outcome matching
   - Why needed: Surface-level agreement doesn't reveal whether AI and humans make decisions for the same reasons
   - Quick check: Compare parameter estimates between human and LLM decisions

2. **Bayesian parameter estimation for choice models** - Using statistical methods to derive decision weights from constrained choice data
   - Why needed: Direct observation of decision mechanisms is impossible; must infer from choices
   - Quick check: Verify parameter stability across different estimation approaches

3. **RAG for mechanism gap mitigation** - Using targeted evidence retrieval to address specific areas of misalignment
   - Why needed: Generic fine-tuning is less efficient than addressing identified mechanism gaps
   - Quick check: Measure reduction in misalignment after targeted evidence injection

4. **Robustness to environmental shifts** - Parameter-based approaches show greater stability than reduced-form methods
   - Why needed: Decision evaluation must remain consistent across changing contexts
   - Quick check: Compare parameter stability vs. outcome agreement under data perturbations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Human Decision Data -> Parameter Estimation -> Mechanism Model -> LLM Decision Data -> Parameter Estimation -> Alignment Analysis -> RAG Intervention -> Alignment Recalculation

**Critical Path:**
1. Collect human constrained choice data (e.g., time allocation)
2. Estimate interpretable decision parameters from human choices
3. Generate LLM decisions under same constraints
4. Estimate LLM decision parameters
5. Compare parameter distributions to identify mechanism gaps
6. Apply targeted RAG interventions
7. Re-estimate parameters to measure intervention effectiveness

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Parameter estimation complexity vs. interpretability: More complex models capture richer mechanisms but may be harder to interpret
- Granularity of intervention: More targeted interventions require more precise mechanism identification
- Computational cost vs. accuracy: More sophisticated estimation methods may improve alignment detection but increase processing time

**Failure Signatures:**
- Parameter estimation instability: May indicate insufficient data or overly complex models
- High alignment in parameters but low in outcomes: Suggests models converge on different mechanisms to reach similar results
- RAG intervention ineffectiveness: Could indicate fundamental model limitations or inadequate evidence

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test parameter estimation stability by varying data sample sizes
2. Compare alignment estimates across different LLM models on same dataset
3. Measure RAG intervention effectiveness across different types of mechanism gaps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Model generalization uncertainty for non-time-based decision domains
- Data representativeness constraints due to ATUS dataset limitations
- RAG intervention generalizability dependent on evidence availability

## Confidence

**Model Generalization Uncertainty (Low-Moderate Confidence):** The framework was validated on time allocation decisions using ATUS data. While the mechanism-based approach appears generalizable to other constrained choice domains, performance on non-time-based decisions remains untested.

**Data Representativeness Constraints (Medium Confidence):** The ATUS dataset captures self-reported time use from a specific population sample. Behavioral patterns may differ across cultural contexts, economic conditions, or time periods.

**RAG Intervention Generalizability (Medium-Low Confidence):** The intervention's success depends on having appropriate evidence available. For domains where relevant evidence is scarce, the mitigation strategy may be less effective.

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on non-time-based constrained choice domains (e.g., budget allocation, product feature selection) to assess domain transferability of alignment estimates
2. Conduct cross-cultural validation using time use or decision datasets from different countries to evaluate alignment measurement consistency across populations
3. Implement stress tests with synthetic data containing known attribute interactions and preference nonlinearities to evaluate parameter estimation accuracy under complex decision structures
