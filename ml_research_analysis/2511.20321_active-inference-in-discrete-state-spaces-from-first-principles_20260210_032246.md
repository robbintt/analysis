# Active Inference in Discrete State Spaces from First Principles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.20321
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20321
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper addresses the problem of understanding active inference in discrete state spaces without relying on the Free Energy Principle, providing a self-contained and mathematically rigorous account of active inference in discrete state spaces.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for active inference in discrete state spaces by formulating the required optimizations as constrained divergence minimization problems. The work establishes a unified treatment of perception and action through a single Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion, rather than separate criteria for perception and action. The paper demonstrates how mean field methods can be applied to solve these optimization problems and extends the framework to Bayesian learning of Hidden Markov Model parameters.

## Method Summary
The core approach formulates active inference as a constrained divergence minimization problem, specifically minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence subject to constraints. This formulation allows standard mean field methods to be applied for solving the resulting optimization problems. The perception/action divergence criterion unifies the treatment of perception and action by optimizing a single objective function. The method also shows how mean field methods apply to Bayesian learning of Hidden Markov Model parameters and updating beliefs about policies, providing a comprehensive framework for discrete state space active inference.

## Key Results
- The perception/action divergence criterion coincides with variational free energy for perception modeling
- The action model differs from expected free energy by an entropy regularizer
- The framework provides a unified treatment of perception and action through a single divergence criterion
- Mean field methods are shown to be applicable for Bayesian learning of HMM parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by reframing active inference as a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to minimize divergence between beliefs and the true distribution while satisfying certain constraints. This mathematical formulation allows the application of well-established mean field methods from statistical physics to solve the optimization problems efficiently. By treating perception and action through a unified divergence minimization framework, the method eliminates the need for separate optimization criteria and provides a more coherent theoretical foundation for active inference.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Mean Field Theory** - A method from statistical physics for approximating complex probability distributions by factorizing them into simpler independent components. This is needed to solve the constrained divergence minimization problems efficiently.
2. **Kullback-Leibler Divergence** - A measure of difference between probability distributions used as the optimization objective. This provides the mathematical foundation for comparing beliefs with true distributions.
3. **Hidden Markov Models** - Probabilistic models for sequential data where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved states. Understanding HMMs is crucial for the Bayesian learning component.
4. **Variational Free Energy** - A functional that serves as a lower bound on log evidence and is central to variational inference. The paper shows its equivalence to the perception/action divergence criterion.
5. **Constrained Optimization** - Mathematical techniques for optimizing functions subject to constraints. This is the fundamental framework used to formulate active inference problems.
6. **Discrete State Spaces** - Systems where variables can take on only a finite number of distinct values. This assumption simplifies the mathematical treatment while maintaining practical relevance.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Belief distribution -> Divergence minimization -> Mean field approximation -> Policy evaluation -> Action selection

Critical path: The system begins with an initial belief distribution about the current state, then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this belief and the true distribution subject to constraints. Mean field methods are applied to approximate the solution, which is then used to evaluate policies and select actions that minimize expected free energy.

Design tradeoffs: The unified divergence minimization approach trades off the complexity of separate perception and action criteria for mathematical elegance and theoretical coherence. The use of mean field approximations trades accuracy for computational efficiency, making the framework scalable to larger problems.

Failure signatures: If the mean field approximation is poor, the resulting belief distributions may be inaccurate, leading to suboptimal policy selection. If the constraints are poorly chosen, the optimization may not converge to meaningful solutions or may violate physical constraints of the system.

First experiments:
1. Verify the equivalence between the perception/action divergence criterion and variational free energy on a simple discrete control task
2. Test the mean field approximation accuracy on a small Hidden Markov Model with known parameters
3. Implement a basic active inference agent using the unified framework and compare performance to standard active inference on a discrete decision-making benchmark

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical framework assumes discrete state spaces, which may not directly generalize to continuous or hybrid systems commonly encountered in real-world applications
- The paper does not address computational scalability concerns when applying mean field methods to large state spaces or complex models
- Empirical validation on real-world tasks is limited, with the focus remaining primarily on theoretical derivations and proofs

## Confidence
- High confidence: The mathematical derivations and proofs establishing the connection between active inference and variational free energy are sound and well-articulated
- Medium confidence: The claim that the perception/action divergence criterion unifies perception and action optimization is supported theoretically but lacks extensive empirical validation
- Medium confidence: The application of mean field methods to Bayesian learning of HMM parameters is theoretically valid but requires empirical testing to confirm practical effectiveness

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the proposed framework on benchmark discrete decision-making tasks to empirically validate the unified perception/action optimization approach
2. Conduct scalability experiments to evaluate the computational efficiency of mean field methods for active inference as state space dimensionality increases
3. Compare the proposed framework's performance against standard active inference implementations on discrete control tasks to assess practical advantages
