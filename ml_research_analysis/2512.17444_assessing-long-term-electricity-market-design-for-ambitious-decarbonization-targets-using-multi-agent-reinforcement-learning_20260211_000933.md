# Assessing Long-Term Electricity Market Design for Ambitious Decarbonization Targets using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.17444
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17444
- Reference count: 40
- This study introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to assess long-term electricity market designs for ambitious decarbonization.

## Executive Summary
This study develops a MARL framework to evaluate long-term electricity market designs for ambitious decarbonization targets. The model uses independent Proximal Policy Optimization to enable profit-maximizing generation companies to make investment decisions in wholesale electricity markets, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. Applied to a stylized Italian electricity system, the framework assesses varying competition levels and market designs under different policy scenarios, highlighting the critical role of market design in decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility.

## Method Summary
The method employs Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) with RLlib to train profit-maximizing generation company agents in a stylized Italian electricity market. Agents make investment decisions across three channels: merchant markets, capacity markets, and contracts for difference. The model uses multi-discrete actions with masking for constraint enforcement and operates on representative days to reduce computational complexity. Training runs for 20-40 hours on 69 parallel environments with a batch size of 35,328.

## Key Results
- The framework enables simultaneous assessment of multiple policy and market mechanisms with market participants adapting to decarbonization pathways
- Capacity markets effectively prevent scarcity events but increase premiums when combined with contracts for difference
- Market design significantly influences decarbonization outcomes and price volatility in the electricity sector

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Independent PPO (IPPO) for Competitive Market Agents
- Claim: Decentralized learning with PPO can produce competitive market equilibria without centralized coordination
- Mechanism: Each GENCO agent maintains separate Actor-Critic networks. The PPO clipping objective prevents destructive policy updates during training, providing implicit stability against non-stationarity from other agents' changing policies.
- Core assumption: The clipping parameter provides sufficient regularization in non-stationary multi-agent settings; agents will converge toward Nash equilibrium rather than collusive strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment"
  - [Section 3.2.4]: "empirical studies have argued that the PPO objective function... has also proven effective in mitigating the non-stationary conditions of multi-agent settings"
  - [corpus]: Weak/missing — no corpus papers directly validate IPPO for electricity market applications
- Break condition: Agents converge to collusive equilibria (detected when aggregated system reward exceeds competitive baseline significantly; Table 3 shows IRR 10-17% vs 8% discount rate, suggesting partial market power)

### Mechanism 2: NPV-Based Reward with Stepwise Discounting
- Claim: Step-by-step discounted cash flow rewards guide agents toward profit-maximizing investment portfolios aligned with real firm objectives
- Mechanism: Reward at each step combines market revenues (short-term energy sales, CfD settlements, capacity premiums) minus investment costs, discounted at exogenous rate r. The environment handles discounting internally rather than relying on RL discount factor γ.
- Core assumption: Risk-neutral NPV maximization approximates actual GENCO behavior; agents can learn long-term investment strategies through cumulative short-term feedback.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.1.2.2, Eq. 1]: "rt = (pm + P CM + P CfD − (ICM + IC CM + IC CfD)) * 1/(1+r)^t"
  - [Appendix A.1.1]: "GENCOs are assumed to be profit-driven private enterprises, thus aiming to maximize the Net Present Value of the cash flows"
  - [corpus]: Related forecasting work ([arxiv:2507.22220], [arxiv:2511.06898]) addresses price dynamics but not agent reward design
- Break condition: When agents exhibit risk-averse behavior (avoiding profitable but uncertain investments) despite risk-neutral objective; observed when IRR >> discount rate without investment in riskier technologies

### Mechanism 3: Multi-Discrete Actions with Masking for Constrained Decisions
- Claim: Fully discrete action space with masking enables constraint enforcement (investment limits, market eligibility) while maintaining learnability
- Mechanism: Actions are multi-discrete (capacity quantities in 4 steps, auction prices in 12 steps). Action masking zeros out invalid actions during gradient computation, enforcing technology constraints and timing restrictions.
- Core assumption: 12-step discretization provides sufficient granularity for auction pricing strategies; agents don't require continuous price optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.1.2.3]: "the model adopts a fully multi-discrete action space, increasing the number of discretization steps for continuous variables"
  - [Appendix A.2.3]: "Discrete action masking... has demonstrated superior performance compared to penalties and other constraint-handling methods"
  - [corpus]: Missing — no corpus papers address action masking in market RL agents
- Break condition: Price cap sensitivity tests (Table C.13, RPL/RPH scenarios) showed limited price sensitivity, suggesting discretization may limit strategy expression at auction boundaries

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed here: Core algorithm for each independent agent. Understanding clipping (ε), entropy regularization (h), and GAE (λ) is essential for hyperparameter tuning.
  - Quick check question: Why does PPO's clipping mechanism help stabilize training when other agents' policies are changing?

- Concept: **Multi-Agent Non-Stationarity & Credit Assignment**
  - Why needed here: In IPPO, each agent perceives a non-stationary environment because competitors' policies evolve. This breaks standard RL convergence assumptions.
  - Quick check question: From Agent i's perspective, why does the transition function P(s'|s,a) become non-stationary, and how does this affect credit assignment?

- Concept: **Market Clearing Mechanisms (Marginal Pricing Auctions)**
  - Why needed here: The environment implements double-sided marginal price auctions. Understanding merit order dispatch and price formation is critical for interpreting agent behavior.
  - Quick check question: In a marginal pricing auction, why does a single price-setter determine the market-clearing price for all accepted bids?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Environment (Gymnasium-compatible) -> GENCO Agents (N parallel) -> Investment Channels (Merchant, CM, CfD) -> Reward Calculator -> Policy Updates

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize N agents with portfolios (incumbents: existing assets; entrants: empty)
  2. For each step (bi-monthly): sample representative day → clear short-term market → compute rewards
  3. Annually: enable investment actions → clear CM auction (adequacy check) → clear CfD auction (RES target check)
  4. Collect trajectories across 69 parallel environments → update networks via PPO (10 SGA epochs per batch)
  5. Train 16-32 hours wall time until convergence

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Copper-plate assumption vs. network constraints: Faster training; ignores congestion/curtailment
  - Multi-discrete vs. continuous actions: Enables masking; discretizes auction prices (12 levels)
  - Independent vs. centralized training: Matches competitive market structure; no credit assignment resolution
  - Representative days vs. full chronology: Reduces state space; loses tail-event resolution

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Collusion detection: Aggregated reward > 2× competitive baseline; HHI > 2500; IRR > 12% with low competition
  - Investment collapse: Negative rewards for >20% of training; near-zero new capacity by 2040
  - Training instability: Reward variance > 50% across episodes; LSTM networks with high entropy (>0.01) showed erratic behavior (Figure B.16)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run EoM with 16 agents, moderate carbon tax; compare 2040 capacity mix vs. PyPSA reference (Figure 7); verify price spikes in scarcity periods (Figure 9)
  2. **Hyperparameter ablation:** Test batch size [17664, 35328] with ε=0.1, h=0.01, MLP [512-512]; track penalty metric (Eq. 4.3) and HHI; expect batch=35328 to reduce variance
  3. **Market design sensitivity:** Compare CM vs. CM+CfD; verify CM prevents scarcity events (Figure 9) but increases premiums when combined with CfD (Figure C.23); confirm emission reduction requires long-term mechanisms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The copper-plate network assumption ignores congestion and curtailment, potentially overstating investment viability
- Action discretization to 12 price levels may constrain auction strategies, particularly at price cap boundaries
- The stylized Italian system may not capture regional heterogeneity or cross-border dynamics

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The NPV-based reward formulation aligns with standard corporate finance theory. The multi-discrete action space with masking successfully enforces investment constraints. The PPO clipping mechanism provides documented stability benefits in single-agent settings.

**Medium confidence**: IPPO can produce competitive market equilibria without centralized coordination. Representative day aggregation preserves key temporal patterns for investment decisions. Capacity markets effectively prevent scarcity events (Figure 9).

**Low confidence**: Agent strategies generalize beyond the stylized Italian system. Collusion detection through IRR and HHI metrics is sufficient. The 12-step price discretization doesn't limit strategic options at auction boundaries.

## Next Checks
1. **Collusion detection validation**: Run the baseline experiment with increased competition (24 agents) and compare IRR distributions. Verify that higher agent count reduces market power formation and brings IRR closer to the 8% discount rate.

2. **Price discretization sensitivity**: Test the model with 24 price steps instead of 12. Compare auction clearing prices and revenue distributions to assess whether finer discretization reveals previously constrained strategies.

3. **Network constraint impact**: Implement DC optimal power flow constraints in a subset of representative days. Compare investment patterns and scarcity events to the copper-plate baseline to quantify network effects on decarbonization pathways.
