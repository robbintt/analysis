# FLToP CTC: Frame-Level Token Pruning via Relative Threshold for Efficient and Memory-Saving Decoding on Diverse Platforms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09085
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09085
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction on LibriSpeech with wav2vec2-large

## Executive Summary
FLToP CTC introduces a dynamic frame-level token pruning algorithm for CTC-based automatic speech recognition systems. By retaining only high-probability tokens per frame based on a relative threshold, the method significantly reduces computational and memory demands during decoding. Evaluated on the LibriSpeech dataset with wav2vec2-large, FLToP CTC delivers substantial efficiency gains while preserving word error rate (WER) performance. The approach is designed to be platform-agnostic, enabling deployment across CPUs, GPUs, and low-resource hardware.

## Method Summary
FLToP CTC addresses the computational and memory bottlenecks of CTC-based ASR systems by introducing a dynamic frame-level token pruning algorithm. The method retains only high-probability tokens per frame, guided by a relative threshold probability, which reduces the search space while maintaining WER performance. Evaluated on LibriSpeech with wav2vec2-large, FLToP CTC achieved a 10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction compared to standard CTC decoders. The approach is platform-agnostic, enabling seamless integration across CPUs, GPUs, and low-resource hardware.

## Key Results
- 10.5x runtime speedup compared to standard CTC decoders
- 2.78x memory reduction on LibriSpeech with wav2vec2-large
- Maintained WER performance across evaluated platforms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FLToP CTC leverages dynamic frame-level token pruning to reduce the effective search space during CTC decoding. By setting a relative threshold probability, only tokens exceeding this threshold are retained per frame, thereby eliminating low-probability candidates early. This reduces both the number of tokens considered during beam search and the memory footprint, while preserving the most likely token sequences for WER.

## Foundational Learning
- **CTC decoding mechanics** – CTC models output probability distributions over tokens per frame; pruning these distributions reduces search space.
- **Relative threshold probability** – Setting thresholds relative to the maximum token probability per frame ensures adaptive pruning sensitivity.
- **Beam search in ASR** – Beam search explores multiple hypotheses; pruning reduces the number of hypotheses considered per step.
- **Memory efficiency in ASR** – Large token vocabularies and long sequences can cause high memory use; pruning mitigates this.
- **Platform-agnostic optimization** – Pruning benefits apply regardless of underlying hardware (CPU/GPU/low-resource).
- **WER preservation** – Pruning must not eliminate tokens that contribute to correct transcription.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input audio -> Feature extractor -> wav2vec2-large encoder -> CTC token probabilities -> FLToP CTC pruning -> Beam search decoder -> Output transcript
- **Critical path**: Encoder output -> Frame-level token pruning -> Beam search decoding
- **Design tradeoffs**: Pruning aggressiveness vs. WER preservation; threshold sensitivity vs. generalization
- **Failure signatures**: Over-aggressive pruning leading to WER degradation; threshold miscalibration under noisy or out-of-domain conditions
- **First experiments**:
  1. Apply FLToP CTC to a smaller ASR model (e.g., Conformer) and measure speedup/memory savings.
  2. Test pruning under noisy or out-of-domain speech conditions to assess robustness.
  3. Evaluate end-to-end latency in a streaming ASR pipeline with FLToP CTC enabled.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single large ASR model (wav2vec2-large) and dataset (LibriSpeech)
- No analysis of pruning sensitivity to threshold choice or edge cases
- Lack of robustness testing under noisy or out-of-domain conditions
- No exploration of pruning effects in streaming or long-form ASR scenarios

## Confidence
- Runtime and memory efficiency gains (High): The reported 10.5x speedup and 2.78x memory reduction are substantial and well-supported by the experimental setup.
- WER preservation across platforms (Medium): While the paper claims consistent WER, the narrow experimental scope limits confidence in cross-platform robustness.
- General applicability to diverse ASR models (Low): No evidence is provided for models beyond wav2vec2-large or for languages/datasets outside LibriSpeech.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate FLToP CTC on smaller or architecturally distinct ASR models (e.g., Conformer, RNN-T) to confirm generalization.
2. Test the pruning algorithm under noisy or out-of-domain conditions to assess robustness and threshold sensitivity.
3. Measure end-to-end latency and memory use in a streaming ASR pipeline to determine practical deployment benefits.
