- Introduces FEST framework integrating privacy metrics with statistical and ML utility assessments

## Executive Summary
This paper presents FEST (Framework for Evaluating Synthetic Tabular data), a comprehensive evaluation framework that addresses the critical gap in assessing synthetic data generation models. FEST integrates diverse privacy metrics including attack-based methods like Diffix, membership inference, and attribute inference, along with distance-based metrics such as DiSCO and relative uniqueness. The framework also incorporates statistical similarity assessments and machine learning utility evaluations to provide a holistic view of synthetic data quality. Implemented as an open-source Python library, FEST was validated across three real-world datasets using six different synthetic data generation models, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing privacy-utility trade-offs.

## Method Summary
FEST provides a unified evaluation framework that combines privacy metrics, statistical similarity measures, and machine learning utility assessments for synthetic tabular data. The framework integrates attack-based privacy metrics (Diffix, membership inference, attribute inference) with distance-based metrics (DiSCO, relative uniqueness) and statistical similarity scores. It also evaluates ML utility through classification, regression, and clustering tasks. The framework was implemented as a Python library and tested on Diabetes, Cardio, and Insurance datasets using CTGAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, Gaussian Copula, CopulaGAN, TV AE, and a Random baseline model. The evaluation revealed that most models showed strong privacy preservation while maintaining high statistical similarity and ML utility scores.

## Key Results
- Most synthetic data generation models showed strong privacy preservation with low DiSCO and relative uniqueness values
- Statistical similarity metrics demonstrated high correlation between synthetic and real data distributions
- ML utility assessments revealed that synthetic data maintained predictive performance for classification and regression tasks
- CTGAN and CopulaGAN models achieved the best balance between privacy preservation and data utility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FEST works by providing a standardized evaluation framework that captures multiple dimensions of synthetic data quality simultaneously. The framework's strength lies in its integration of diverse metrics that collectively assess privacy preservation, statistical fidelity, and practical utility. By combining attack-based metrics that measure vulnerability to specific attacks with distance-based metrics that quantify information leakage, FEST provides a comprehensive privacy assessment. The addition of statistical similarity measures ensures that synthetic data maintains the essential distributional properties of real data, while ML utility evaluations verify that the synthetic data remains useful for downstream tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Privacy Metrics Hierarchy** - Why needed: Different privacy attacks require different evaluation approaches; quick check: verify that all relevant attack types are covered by the framework's metrics
2. **Statistical Similarity Measures** - Why needed: Synthetic data must preserve statistical properties of real data; quick check: compare correlation coefficients between synthetic and real data distributions
3. **ML Utility Assessment** - Why needed: Synthetic data must remain useful for practical applications; quick check: validate that ML models trained on synthetic data perform comparably to those trained on real data
4. **Privacy-Utility Trade-off** - Why needed: Understanding the balance between privacy preservation and data utility; quick check: analyze correlation between privacy scores and utility metrics across different models

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Loader -> Privacy Metrics -> Statistical Similarity -> ML Utility -> Results Aggregator
**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline flows from data loading through privacy assessment, statistical comparison, and utility evaluation, with results aggregated for comprehensive analysis
**Design Tradeoffs**: FEST prioritizes comprehensiveness over simplicity, integrating multiple metric types at the cost of increased computational complexity
**Failure Signatures**: Poor synthetic data quality manifests as low privacy scores across multiple attack types, poor statistical similarity metrics, and degraded ML utility performance
**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate a basic synthetic data generator (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Model) on a simple dataset to verify framework functionality
2. Compare two different synthetic data generation approaches on the same dataset to understand privacy-utility trade-offs
3. Test the framework's sensitivity by evaluating synthetic data with known privacy vulnerabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation on only three real-world datasets (Diabetes, Cardio, Insurance) may not represent full diversity of tabular data structures
- Weighting and relative importance of metrics remains subjective and application-dependent
- Comparison across six synthetic data generation models may not capture all relevant approaches in this rapidly evolving field

## Confidence
- High confidence in the framework's technical implementation and metric calculations
- Medium confidence in the generalizability of results across different domains
- Medium confidence in the practical utility of the framework for real-world applications
- Low confidence in the optimal balance between privacy and utility metrics without application-specific tuning

## Next Checks
1. Test FEST on additional datasets with different characteristics (categorical, mixed-type, high-dimensional) to validate generalizability across data types
2. Conduct user studies with data practitioners to evaluate the framework's practical utility and identify missing evaluation dimensions
3. Compare FEST's assessments against ground truth privacy breaches in controlled experiments where synthetic data is generated from known vulnerable training data
