- This work investigates whether modern speech models implicitly encode prosodic emphasis by analyzing residual representations between neutral and emphasized word pairs.

## Executive Summary
This work investigates whether modern speech models implicitly encode prosodic emphasis by analyzing residual representations between neutral and emphasized word pairs. A novel residual-based framework is proposed, treating emphasis as a systematic transformation rather than an isolated acoustic property. Experiments on synthetic word pairs from multiple self-supervised models show that residuals correlate strongly with duration changes and occupy low-dimensional subspaces. In ASR fine-tuned models, residuals are up to 50% more compact and yield higher emphasis reconstruction performance while containing less word identity information.

## Method Summary
The method extracts word-level representations from multiple self-supervised speech models (wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, data2Vec, XLS-R) and their ASR fine-tuned variants. Using the EmphAssess benchmark dataset with 3,732 aligned neutral-emphasized word pairs, the framework computes residuals (B - A) between paired representations. These residuals undergo midpoint centering before PCA to analyze effective dimensionality (D95%), directional consistency, and disentanglement from lexical content. Ridge regression predicts duration change from residual PCs, while logistic regression tests word identity encoding.

## Key Results
- Residual vectors between neutral and emphasized representations show strong directional consistency and occupy significantly lower-dimensional subspaces (up to 50% more compact in ASR fine-tuned models)
- Residuals correlate strongly with duration changes (R² AUC = 0.71) while containing minimal word identity information (accuracy AUC = 0.26)
- ASR fine-tuning amplifies and regularizes emphasis encoding, making it more structured and accessible for downstream tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Emphasis manifests as a structured, low-dimensional residual transformation between neutral and emphasized word representations.
- **Mechanism:** The framework computes residual vectors R = B − A (emphasized minus neutral representations for aligned word pairs). If emphasis is encoded systematically, these residuals should exhibit (a) directional consistency across different words, and (b) occupy a low-dimensional subspace rather than being word-specific memorizations.
- **Core assumption:** Emphasis is relational—a word sounds prominent only relative to how it would sound without emphasis and to surrounding prosodic context.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "residual vectors between neutral and emphasized representations show strong directional consistency and occupy a significantly lower-dimensional subspace (up to 50% more compact in ASR fine-tuned models)"
- **Break condition:** If residuals showed high dimensional spread (D95% ≈ full space) or random directional alignment (θ̂R near 0), the hypothesis would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Task-specific fine-tuning (particularly ASR) amplifies and regularizes emphasis encoding.
- **Mechanism:** Fine-tuning reshapes representation geometry—ASR objectives appear to push emphasis-related variation into a more compact subspace while disentangling it from lexical content. This suggests prosodic sensitivity becomes more accessible post-adaptation.
- **Core assumption:** ASR fine-tuning doesn't destroy prosodic information but reorganizes it.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "emphasis is encoded as a consistent, low-dimensional transformation that becomes more structured with task-specific learning"
- **Break condition:** If ASR fine-tuning eliminated emphasis sensitivity (residual variance → 0 or word identity encoding in residuals → high), the mechanism would not hold.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Residuals encode emphasis correlates (especially duration change) while discarding lexical identity.
- **Mechanism:** Since R = B − A subtracts the neutral baseline, word-specific information cancels out if the same word's neutral and emphasized forms differ primarily along prosodic dimensions. Ridge regression from residual PCs to duration change δ achieves high R²; logistic regression from residuals to word identity fails.
- **Core assumption:** Paired neutral/emphasized words are properly aligned (same speaker, transcript, word identity).
- **Evidence anchors:** [Section III-B4-B5] Duration reconstruction from residuals: R² AUC = 0.71; word identity from residuals: accuracy AUC = 0.26 (near chance)
- **Break condition:** If residuals performed well on word identity prediction, lexical content wouldn't be disentangled—the framework would be capturing word-specific artifacts rather than emphasis structure.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Residual space analysis**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's core innovation is treating residuals (B − A) as a first-class object of study rather than noise. This requires understanding that subtracting paired representations can isolate systematic variation.
  - **Quick check question:** Given two vectors a = [2, 3] and b = [3, 5] representing neutral and emphasized versions of a word, what does the residual r = b − a represent? (Answer: [1, 2]—the direction/magnitude of the emphasis transformation)

- **Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and effective dimensionality**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses D95% (PCs needed for 95% variance) to quantify how "compact" emphasis encoding is. Lower D95% = more structured/consistent transformation.
  - **Quick check question:** If a 768-dimensional residual space has D95% = 50, what does that imply about emphasis encoding? (Answer: Emphasis variation is highly structured, concentrated in a 50-dimensional subspace rather than spread across all 768 dims)

- **Concept: Probing classifiers and what they (don't) prove**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper explicitly critiques label-prediction probes for risking overstatement (Section I). The word identity probe here serves as a *disentanglement test*—low accuracy is the desired result.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is low word identity accuracy from residuals a *good* sign in this study? (Answer: It means residuals have stripped lexical content, isolating emphasis-specific variation)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** EmphAssess dataset → Montreal Forced Aligner → word-level frame averaging → representations z(l)_i,j per layer/word → residual computation R = B − A → midpoint centering → PCA → analysis modules

- **Critical path:**
  1. Extract layer-wise representations for all words across all models
  2. Construct 3,732 aligned neutral-emphasized pairs (matched on speaker, word, transcript)
  3. Apply midpoint centering before PCA (crucial: standard centering would remove the offset being studied)
  4. Compute residuals → run all four analysis modules per layer per model
  5. Compare pretrained vs. fine-tuned geometries

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Synthetic vs. natural speech:** Synthetic data (EmphAssess) enables controlled pairing but may not generalize to natural prosody variation
  - **Word-level vs. phrasal:** Analysis limited to word boundaries; prosody spans larger units (Section VI acknowledges this)
  - **Midpoint centering:** Preserves global offset between A and B groups; standard mean-centering would destroy the signal of interest

- **Failure signatures:**
  - θ̂R ≈ 0 (residuals not directionally aligned → no consistent emphasis direction)
  - D95%(R) ≈ D95%(C) (residuals as high-dimensional as full space → no compression)
  - Word ID accuracy from residuals ≈ word ID from concatenated (lexical content not disentangled)
  - Duration reconstruction R² ≈ 0 (residuals don't encode known emphasis correlate)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce cosine similarity distributions (Figure 2):** On wav2vec 2.0 layer 7, verify that θAB < θAA (emphasis changes representations) and θ̂R > θRR (individual residuals align with mean direction better than random pairs)
  2. **Duration reconstruction ablation:** Fit ridge regression using top-k PCs of residuals; plot R² vs. k to confirm residuals outperform A, B, C spaces with fewer components
  3. **Layer-wise sweep:** Reproduce Figure 6 to identify where emphasis sensitivity peaks (middle-to-deep layers for most models) and verify ASR fine-tuning lowers D95%

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic vs. natural speech generalization: The EmphAssess benchmark uses TTS data with controlled emphasis, which may not capture the full complexity and variability of natural prosodic emphasis
- Word-level analysis scope: Prosodic emphasis operates at phrasal and discourse levels beyond individual words
- Correlation vs. causation in fine-tuning effects: The causal relationship between fine-tuning objectives and representation geometry changes remains correlational

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Mechanism 1 (residuals show consistent, low-dimensional structure), Mechanism 3 (residuals encode duration while discarding word identity)
- **Medium confidence:** Mechanism 2 (ASR fine-tuning amplifies emphasis structure), overall residual framework validity
- **Low confidence:** Generalization to natural speech, applicability to phrasal-level prosody

## Next Checks
1. **Natural speech validation:** Apply the residual framework to a spontaneous speech corpus with manually annotated emphasis (e.g., Boston Radio News corpus). Verify that residuals maintain directional consistency and duration correlation despite natural variability in speaking style and acoustic conditions.
2. **Phrasal emphasis extension:** Modify the framework to compute residuals at the phrasal level (e.g., between emphasized and neutral versions of full utterances). Test whether emphasis transforms occupy even lower-dimensional subspaces when considering larger prosodic units.
3. **Fine-tuning objective ablation:** Fine-tune wav2vec 2.0 on multiple tasks (ASR, emotion classification, translation) and compare residual geometry changes. This would isolate whether emphasis regularization is specific to ASR objectives or a general effect of task adaptation.
