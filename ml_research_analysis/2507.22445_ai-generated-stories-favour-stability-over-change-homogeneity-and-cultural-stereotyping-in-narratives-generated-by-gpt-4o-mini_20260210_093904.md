# AI-generated stories favour stability over change: homogeneity and cultural stereotyping in narratives generated by gpt-4o-mini

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.22445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22445
- Reference count: 11
- Authors: Jill Walker Rettberg; Hermann Wigers
- Key finding: GPT-4o-mini-generated stories for 236 countries overwhelmingly follow a single plot structure favoring stability over change

## Executive Summary
This study reveals that GPT-4o-mini generates highly homogeneous stories across 236 countries, with narratives following a repetitive plot structure centered on protagonists returning to small towns and resolving challenges through tradition and community reconnection. The research found minimal cultural diversity in story content, with real-world conflicts sanitized and romance largely absent. Surface-level national stereotypes appear in stories, but deep narrative uniformity suggests the model standardizes plots based on training data rather than authentically representing diverse cultural perspectives. The authors have made their dataset of 11,800 stories publicly available for further analysis.

## Method Summary
The study analyzed 11,800 stories generated by GPT-4o-mini across 236 countries, examining plot structures, character types, conflict resolution patterns, and cultural representation. Researchers coded the stories to identify recurring narrative patterns and assess the presence of national stereotypes versus authentic cultural diversity in the generated content.

## Key Results
- 11,800 stories show overwhelming narrative homogeneity across 236 countries
- Stories follow a single plot structure: protagonist returns to small town, faces minor challenge, resolves through tradition/community
- Surface-level national stereotypes present, but deep cultural diversity absent
- Romance largely absent, conflicts sanitized and resolved through stability rather than change

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism driving narrative homogeneity appears to be the model's reliance on dominant patterns in its training data, which standardizes story generation across diverse cultural contexts. The absence of diverse narrative structures and authentic cultural representation suggests the model prioritizes familiar, stable plot templates over culturally specific storytelling traditions.

## Foundational Learning
- Prompt engineering: Understanding how prompts shape AI-generated narratives is crucial for interpreting model outputs and designing better evaluation frameworks
- Narrative theory: Knowledge of plot structures and storytelling conventions helps identify when AI-generated stories deviate from authentic cultural patterns
- Cultural representation: Recognizing how AI models handle cultural diversity and stereotypes is essential for assessing fairness and authenticity in generated content
- Natural language generation: Understanding how transformer models generate text helps explain why certain patterns emerge consistently across different contexts
- Bias detection: Skills in identifying and measuring bias in AI outputs are needed to evaluate the quality and fairness of generated stories

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Prompt -> GPT-4o-mini model -> Story generation -> Human coding/analysis
Critical path: Input prompt → Token generation → Narrative construction → Output story
Design tradeoffs: The model prioritizes coherence and familiar plot structures over cultural authenticity and narrative diversity
Failure signatures: Repetitive plot structures, sanitized conflicts, absence of romance, surface-level stereotypes
First experiments: 1) Vary temperature settings to test impact on narrative diversity; 2) Test different prompt formulations to assess consistency of patterns; 3) Compare outputs with human-generated stories from same cultures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to single model variant without comparison across different parameters or fine-tuning approaches
- 236-country scope represents only subset of global cultures
- Classification relies on subjective human coding that may introduce bias
- Patterns may reflect prompt design rather than inherent model limitations
- Does not examine whether patterns persist across different story genres

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in narrative homogeneity finding (supported by large sample size)
- Low confidence in cultural stereotyping claims (subjective nature of assessment)
- Medium confidence that patterns are not artifacts of prompt design

## Next Checks
1. Systematic comparison of narrative diversity across different model parameters (temperature, top-p sampling) and prompting strategies
2. Blind human evaluation of story authenticity and cultural representation by native writers from represented countries
3. Longitudinal analysis tracking whether model updates reduce or amplify these homogeneity patterns over time
