# Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13972
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Distributional Consistency (DC) loss improves inverse problem reconstructions by replacing pointwise matching with statistical calibration using model-based probability scores.

## Executive Summary
Distributional Consistency (DC) loss is a novel data-fidelity objective for inverse problems that evaluates statistical consistency between observed measurements and noise distributions implied by current estimates, rather than minimizing pointwise errors. By converting each measurement into a CDF value under its predicted noise distribution and testing how close these values are to uniform (via logit transform and Wasserstein-1 distance), DC loss avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without priors. Across image denoising and medical image reconstruction tasks, DC loss reduces noise artifacts and enhances regularization efficacy, positioning it as a statistically grounded alternative to conventional fidelity losses.

## Method Summary
DC loss replaces traditional pointwise data-fidelity terms with a distributional calibration approach. For each measurement, it computes the CDF value under the predicted noise distribution, applies a logit transform to prevent gradient saturation, and measures deviation from uniformity using Wasserstein-1 distance. This is implemented through per-index noise models (Gaussian, Poisson, clipped Gaussian) with tail approximations for numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers and regularizers, requiring only the noise model specification.

## Key Results
- DC loss prevents overfitting to measurement noise, maintaining non-zero loss even when MSE approaches zero in over-parameterized regimes
- In image denoising, DC loss achieves PSNR plateauing at ~30.3 dB while MSE loss degrades below 27 dB due to noise fitting
- In Poisson PET reconstruction, DC loss with TV regularization requires regularization strength orders of magnitude lower than NLL+TV for comparable image quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Probability Integral Transform for Collective Calibration
DC loss evaluates statistical consistency by testing whether observed measurements collectively match the noise distributions implied by the current estimate, rather than minimizing pointwise errors. For each measurement m_i, compute s_i = F_i(m_i | ŷ_i), the CDF value under the predicted noise distribution. If the model is correct, the probability integral transform guarantees these s_i values should be uniformly distributed on [0,1]. The loss measures deviation from uniformity via Wasserstein-1 distance after logit transformation.

### Mechanism 2: Gradient Preservation via Logit Transform
Applying the logit transform to CDF values prevents gradient vanishing at the boundaries and enables stable optimization across the entire solution trajectory. Raw CDF values s_i ∈ [0,1] saturate at 0 or 1 when predictions are far from measurements, yielding ∂s_i/∂θ̂_j ≈ 0. The logit transform r_i = logit(s_i) = ln(s_i/(1-s_i)) stretches endpoints to ±∞, preserving non-zero gradients. This transforms the uniform target to Logistic(0,1).

### Mechanism 3: Behavior Transition from MSE-like to Noise-Stopping
DC loss exhibits MSE/NLL-like convergence when far from the solution, but removes the incentive to fit noise once measurements become statistically consistent. Using Laplace tail approximations, when |m_i - ŷ_i|/σ is large, r_i ≈ (m_i - ŷ_i)²/(2σ²), so ∂r_i/∂ŷ_i ≈ -(m_i - ŷ_i)/σ², matching MSE gradients. Near the solution, once CDF values are uniformly distributed, further optimization yields near-zero DC loss regardless of which data-consistent solution is selected.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Probability Integral Transform**
  - Why needed here: Core theoretical foundation ensuring that if m ~ D(θ*), then F(m | θ*) ~ Uniform[0,1]. Without understanding this, the uniformity target appears arbitrary.
  - Quick check question: If X ~ N(μ, σ²), what is the distribution of Φ((X - μ)/σ)?

- **Concept: Wasserstein-1 (Earth Mover's) Distance**
  - Why needed here: The metric used to quantify discrepancy between empirical CDF-value distribution and target Logistic(0,1). Requires understanding of why sorting + L1 works.
  - Quick check question: For two sorted samples of size N, how do you compute Wasserstein-1 distance?

- **Concept: Inverse Problem Formulation (Data-Fidelity vs Regularization Tradeoff)**
  - Why needed here: DC loss reframes data-fidelity from pointwise matching to distributional consistency, changing how it interacts with regularization (no longer trading off fidelity for regularity near solution).
  - Quick check question: In classical reconstruction, what happens to MSE loss as iterations → ∞ when the model is over-parameterized?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  ```
  Predicted signal ŷ = f(θ̂)
        ↓
  Per-measurement CDF evaluation: s_i = F_i(m_i | ŷ_i)
        ↓
  Logit transform: r_i = logit(s_i) [with tail approximations]
        ↓
  Sort {r_i} ascending
        ↓
  Wasserstein-1 distance to sorted Logistic(0,1) samples: L_DC = (1/N) Σ|r_i - u_i|
  ```

- **Critical path:**
  1. Implement noise-model-specific CDF/logit computation with tail handling (Algorithms 2-4 in Appendix)
  2. Verify uniformity of CDF values when evaluating on true signal (sanity check per Figures E1, F1)
  3. Integrate with existing optimizer (Adam preferred per experiments)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Tail threshold τ/ε/δ: Lower values use more exact CDF/logit but risk numerical instability; higher values use more approximation. Paper uses thresholds around 3-5σ equivalents.
  - Sample size N: Larger N yields more reliable aggregate statistics but O(N log N) sorting cost.
  - Regularizer choice: DC loss reduces need for strong regularization, but regularizer is still essential to select among DC-consistent solutions (Figure 8 shows β for DC+TV is orders of magnitude smaller than NLL+TV).

- **Failure signatures:**
  - CDF histogram collapsing to peak at 0.5 = overfitting (DC loss should prevent this)
  - CDF histogram with peaks at 0 and 1 = underfitting (model not explaining data)
  - DC loss plateauing above ln(4) ≈ 1.386 = all CDFs stuck at 0.5 (Eq. 75)
  - Gradient instability near boundaries = tail approximation not triggering

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Sanity check on known signal:** Compute DC loss on true signal + noise; verify histogram is approximately uniform and loss ≈ 0 (replicate Figure E1/F1 pattern).
  2. **1D deconvolution comparison:** Implement simple MSE vs DC loss deconvolution with known blur kernel and Gaussian noise; compare loss trajectories and CDF histograms (replicate Appendix D setup).
  3. **Overfitting test:** Train under-parameterized vs over-parameterized model with DC loss; verify DC loss plateaus but MSE loss → 0 in over-parameterized case (demonstrate noise-chasing prevention).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can distributional consistency (DC) loss be effectively integrated with learned regularizers or generative priors?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in Section 6.3 that "Integrations with learned components are a natural next step but beyond the scope of this foundational study."
- Why unresolved: The current study deliberately restricted experiments to unsupervised (non-learned) regularization to isolate the performance of the DC data-fidelity term without confounding factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing DC loss performance when paired with score-based generative models (e.g., diffusion models) or pre-trained neural network denoisers in inverse problem tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is DC loss in small-data regimes or when measurement noise is strongly correlated?
- Basis in paper: Section 6.2 lists these as limitations: "conditions... may limit applicability in small-data regimes or when noise is strongly correlated or poorly characterized."
- Why unresolved: The theoretical foundation of DC loss relies on the probability integral transform across many independent measurements to approximate a uniform distribution; this aggregate assessment may fail or become unreliable with few data points or correlated noise structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reconstruction quality metrics in inverse problems characterized by sparse measurements (small N) or spatially/temporally correlated noise patterns compared to standard fidelity losses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal implementation of DC loss for discrete noise models, such as Poisson, at very low count levels?
- Basis in paper: Appendix F.2 notes that "Further work is required to determine how to best adjust for the discrete nature of the Poisson distribution at lower doses," and Section 6.2 mentions the potential need for a randomized probability integral transform.
- Why unresolved: The naive probability integral transform does not result in exact uniformity for discrete distributions, and the approximation error becomes more pronounced at low counts (low doses).
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of low-dose reconstruction tasks using naive PIT versus randomized PIT (as described in Appendix A.3) to determine if the latter significantly improves calibration and image quality.

## Limitations
- Requires accurate knowledge of per-index noise models; performance degrades if noise characteristics are mis-specified
- May be less effective in small-data regimes where aggregate statistics are unreliable
- Discrete noise distributions (Poisson at low counts) require careful handling of probability integral transform

## Confidence

### Claims with High Confidence
- DC loss prevents overfitting to measurement noise by maintaining non-zero loss when MSE approaches zero (supported by Figure 4 and Figure 5)
- DC loss is compatible with existing regularizers and optimizers (supported by Section 4.2 showing integration with TV regularization)
- The probability integral transform guarantees uniform CDF values under correct models (supported by Section 3.2 theoretical derivation)

### Claims with Medium Confidence
- DC loss provides similar gradient directions to MSE far from solution (supported by Appendix D numerical verification but relies on Laplace approximations)
- DC loss reduces regularization strength requirements compared to NLL (supported by Figure 8 but depends on specific problem setup)

### Claims with Low Confidence
- DC loss will integrate seamlessly with learned priors (explicitly called out as future work in Section 6.3)
- DC loss performance in strongly correlated noise environments (explicitly noted as limitation in Section 6.2)

## Next Checks
1. Verify uniformity of CDF values when evaluating DC loss on true signal with known noise (should yield histogram close to uniform and loss near zero)
2. Compare gradient directions of DC loss vs MSE loss far from solution using 1D deconvolution example
3. Test overfitting behavior by training over-parameterized model with both DC and MSE losses, checking if DC loss plateaus while MSE approaches zero
