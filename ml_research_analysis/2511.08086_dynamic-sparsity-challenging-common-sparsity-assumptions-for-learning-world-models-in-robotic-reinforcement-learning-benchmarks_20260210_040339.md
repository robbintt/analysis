# Dynamic Sparsity: Challenging Common Sparsity Assumptions for Learning World Models in Robotic Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.08086
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08086
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Global sparsity is rare in MuJoCo dynamics; state-dependent sparsity dominates

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the common assumption that world models for robotic reinforcement learning exhibit inherent sparsity. By analyzing ground-truth dynamics from the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, the authors demonstrate that while global sparsity (consistent zero Jacobian entries) is uncommon, state-dependent sparsity is prevalent. The study reveals that Jacobian elements become zero only under specific conditions, such as during contact events, and these sparsity patterns exhibit temporal clustering. These findings suggest that current architectures and sparsity priors may be inadequate for capturing the true structure of real-world dynamics.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze transition function Jacobians from the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite to study sparsity patterns in robotic dynamics. They examine both global sparsity (consistently zero Jacobian entries) and state-dependent sparsity (zero entries that vary with state). The analysis includes temporal studies to identify clustering patterns in sparsity, and experiments with naive MLP training to assess whether standard architectures can recover these structures. The Jacobian sparsity serves as a proxy for causal structure sparsity in the dynamics.

## Key Results
- Global sparsity (consistent zero Jacobian entries) is rare across MuJoCo Playground environments
- State-dependent sparsity dominates, with specific Jacobian elements becoming zero only under certain conditions (e.g., contact events)
- Sparsity patterns exhibit temporal clustering, with stable patterns interrupted by abrupt transitions
- Naive MLP training can partially recover sparsity patterns but fails to capture the full structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that real-world dynamics exhibit structured sparsity that depends on the current state and context, rather than static sparsity patterns. Contact events, for instance, create transient sparsity conditions where certain state transitions have no effect. This state-dependent behavior manifests as temporal clustering of sparsity patterns, where periods of dense interactions are punctuated by moments of structural simplification. The mechanism suggests that world models need to adapt their structure based on the current state and environmental conditions rather than assuming fixed sparsity patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Jacobian sparsity analysis** - why needed: To quantify structural relationships in dynamics; quick check: Compute sparsity patterns for multiple environments
- **State-dependent dynamics** - why needed: Captures how physical interactions vary with context; quick check: Identify conditions that trigger sparsity changes
- **Temporal clustering** - why needed: Reveals patterns in how sparsity evolves over time; quick check: Measure autocorrelation of sparsity patterns
- **MLP architecture limitations** - why needed: Establishes baseline for architectural effectiveness; quick check: Compare sparsity recovery across different model depths

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Jacobian computation -> Sparsity analysis -> MLP training -> Evaluation

**Critical path:** The analysis pipeline flows from computing ground-truth Jacobians to training MLPs for sparsity recovery, with the evaluation focusing on how well architectures capture state-dependent patterns.

**Design tradeoffs:** The choice of naive MLP as baseline represents a tradeoff between simplicity and effectiveness. While MLPs are universal function approximators, their lack of explicit structural priors makes them poorly suited for capturing state-dependent sparsity patterns.

**Failure signatures:** Architectures fail when they cannot adapt to changing sparsity conditions, showing poor performance during contact events or when transitioning between sparsity regimes.

**Three first experiments:**
1. Train MLPs with varying depths to identify the impact of model capacity on sparsity recovery
2. Compare MLP performance across different sparsity thresholds to assess robustness
3. Analyze MLP predictions during contact events versus non-contact periods to identify failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights the need for architectures that can dynamically adapt to state-dependent sparsity patterns rather than assuming static structural priors. It questions whether current sparsity assumptions in world model learning are fundamentally flawed and calls for investigation into more sophisticated architectures that can capture the temporal clustering and context-dependent nature of real-world dynamics.

## Limitations
- Findings are based solely on MuJoCo Playground benchmarks, limiting generalizability
- Analysis focuses on Jacobian sparsity as a proxy, which may miss higher-order dependencies
- The study does not explore whether specialized architectures could better capture state-dependent sparsity

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The empirical observation that global sparsity is rare while state-dependent sparsity is prevalent in MuJoCo Playground benchmarks
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that current architectures are insufficient for capturing the full structure of state-dependent sparsity
- **Low confidence:** The broader implication that sparsity assumptions in learning world models are fundamentally flawed

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the sparsity analysis across multiple robotic benchmark suites (including real-world datasets) to assess generalizability of findings
2. Evaluate whether specialized architectures (e.g., graph neural networks, attention mechanisms) can better capture state-dependent sparsity patterns compared to naive MLPs
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the sparsity threshold and Jacobian computation methods to ensure observed patterns are robust to analytical choices
