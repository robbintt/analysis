# Beyond the Black Box: A Cognitive Architecture for Explainable and Aligned AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03072
- Authors: Hu Keyi
- Reference count: 19
- One-line primary result: Proposes a cognitive architecture enabling transparent, value-aligned AI via traceable atomic reasoning and interpretable Weight = Benefit × Probability decision-making.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a cognitive architecture designed to overcome the black-box nature of current AI systems. By deconstructing cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations—Pointing and Comparison—it enables radical explainability and intrinsic generality for novel situations. All decisions are traceable to a finite set of auditable Initial Weights, ensuring value alignment and human-like reasoning. Experiments validate its ability to handle moral dilemmas and novel scenarios through first-principles reasoning, establishing a theoretical and practical foundation for trustworthy Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## Method Summary
The Weight-Calculatism architecture formalizes decision-making through a Weight = Benefit × Probability formula, where Benefit traces to interpretable Initial Weights (e.g., survival, knowledge). Cognition is decomposed into Logical Atoms (stable primitives like "red" or "apple") and two operations: Pointing (activation of related atoms) and Comparison (evaluation of similarities/differences). A graph-structured Logical Atom library integrates perception via preprocessors, with a Central Computation Area coordinating reasoning and a Global Workspace for information integration. The architecture supports both reflexive (fast) and deliberative (slow) decision channels, enabling scalable, modular design.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates traceable explainability by linking all decisions to auditable Initial Weights.
- Validates intrinsic generality for novel situations via on-the-fly composition from atomic operations.
- Achieves superior value alignment compared to statistical pattern-matching paradigms.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Explainability emerges from traceable atomic decomposition of cognition.
- Mechanism: The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations (Pointing and Comparison). Decisions are formalized via Weight = Benefit × Probability, where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. Any decision can be traced to its atomic-level constituents and first principles.
- Core assumption: Complex cognitive acts can be decomposed into stable, interpretable primitives without loss of essential properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations... all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights."
  - [section: Weight-Calculatism Architecture] "This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability... answering not just how but why."
  - [corpus] Weak direct validation; related work on "Explainable Graph Neural Networks via Structural Externalities" addresses GNN explainability but not atomic decomposition.
- Break condition: Cognitive tasks require emergent representations that cannot be decomposed into pre-defined Logical Atoms without functional loss.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intrinsic generality for novel situations is achieved via on-the-fly composition from atomic operations.
- Mechanism: Instead of pre-compiled rules, the system composes solutions from atomic Pointing and Comparison operations in real-time. Pointing activates related Logical Atoms; Comparison evaluates similarities/differences, enabling first-principles reasoning in unprecedented scenarios.
- Core assumption: Novel situations can be addressed by recombining finite atomic operations and existing Logical Atoms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "intrinsic generality for novel situations... rather than statistical pattern matching."
  - [section: Novel Response Validation] "The system engaged in dynamic learning... innovatively responding to completely novel situations through first-principles reasoning."
  - [corpus] No direct validation; "CogRec" addresses cognitive architectures but not novel scenario generalization via atomic operations.
- Break condition: Novel domains require qualitatively new Logical Atoms or operations that cannot be derived through combination.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Traceable value alignment is achieved by grounding all decisions in a finite, auditable set of Initial Weights.
- Mechanism: All decisions trace through causal chains to Initial Weights (e.g., survival, knowledge). The Weight = Benefit × Probability formula ensures the "why" of any decision can be audited; modifying Initial Weights adjusts value alignment.
- Core assumption: All meaningful values derive from a finite, well-defined set of Initial Weights stable across contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "traceable value alignment by grounding reasoning in interpretable symbolic logic."
  - [section: Weight-Calculation] "By modifying the Initial Weights, we can easily alter its 'personality' and behavioral traits."
  - [corpus] Limited; "Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs" discusses alignment risks but not the Initial Weight mechanism.
- Break condition: Value conflicts emerge that cannot be resolved by existing Initial Weights, or contextual nuances require infinitely many weights.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Logical Atoms as cognitive primitives
  - Why needed here: Core representational unit; without understanding these, you cannot build or audit the cognitive library.
  - Quick check question: Can you distinguish between a "conscious experience" atom (e.g., "red") and a "property" atom (e.g., "edibility")?

- Concept: Pointing vs. Comparison operations
  - Why needed here: These are the only two operations in the system; all reasoning reduces to these.
  - Quick check question: Given "smoke" and "fire," which operation links them (Pointing), and which operation determines they are "different" concepts (Comparison)?

- Concept: Weight = Benefit × Probability
  - Why needed here: Central decision-making formula; all choices are arbitrated by this calculation.
  - Quick check question: If an action has high Benefit but low Probability, what happens to its Weight compared to a medium-Benefit, high-Probability alternative?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Logical Atom Cognitive Library (graph-structured knowledge)
  - Initial Weight Library (axiomatic values)
  - Pointing/Comparison Operations (reasoning primitives)
  - Central Computation Area/Global Workspace (integration hub)
  - Weight-Calculation Engine (decision arbitration)
  - Preprocessors (perception modules)
  - Motor/Action Modules (execution)

- Critical path:
  1. Perception → Preprocessors → Logical Atom activation
  2. Central Computation Area integrates activated atoms
  3. Goal generation from internal states + Initial Weights
  4. Solution search via Pointing traversal
  5. Weight-Calculation for candidate actions
  6. Decision arbitration and motor command issuance
  7. Experience consolidation (graph update)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Symbolic transparency vs. neural pattern-matching efficiency
  - Manual Initial Weight curation vs. learned value systems
  - Reflexive (fast) vs. deliberative (slow) decision channels
  - Graph scalability vs. real-time response latency

- Failure signatures:
  - Decisions trace to incomprehensible atom chains (knowledge graph corruption)
  - Weight calculations dominated by a single Initial Weight (value imbalance)
  - Novel situations trigger no relevant Pointing paths (sparse cognitive library)
  - Comparison operations fail to identify key differences (inadequate atom granularity)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the fire-escape moral dilemma with modified Initial Weights; verify traceability of changed decisions to specific weight adjustments.
  2. Introduce a novel object with partial similarity to known entities; test whether Comparison + dynamic Pointing creation enables appropriate handling.
  3. Stress-test the reflexive vs. deliberative channels by varying decision time constraints in a simulated environment; measure accuracy-explainability tradeoffs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How can the Logical Atom cognitive library be constructed and maintained at the scale required for AGI without prohibitive manual engineering costs?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 9 states that building a comprehensive library is a "large-scale endeavor" requiring "layered, automated, and incremental strategies" involving LLMs and manual refinement.
  - Why unresolved: The paper validates the architecture using small, hand-crafted scenarios (fire escape, alien ecosystem) but does not demonstrate the automated acquisition of atoms from unstructured data at scale.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A functional system that autonomously extracts and integrates thousands of Logical Atoms from raw text or sensor data with high fidelity.

- **Open Question 2**: How does the architecture effectively ground abstract Logical Atoms in raw, high-dimensional sensorimotor data?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper critiques deep learning's lack of a world model (Page 2) but relies on "Preprocessors" (Page 6) to convert perception into symbols without explaining how this interface avoids the symbol grounding problem.
  - Why unresolved: The mechanism for translating continuous perceptual input (e.g., visual pixels) into discrete, stable "Logical Atoms" remains a conceptual gap in the implementation details.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An embodied agent successfully navigating a novel physical environment by dynamically generating and refining Logical Atoms from raw sensory input.

- **Open Question 3**: Does the graph-algorithmic engine provide sufficient computational efficiency for real-time decision-making in complex environments compared to parallel neural networks?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proposes a "Hybrid Decision-Making Mode" (Page 8) involving "Reflexive Fast Channels" to handle real-time needs, implying pure deliberative reasoning may be too slow for all tasks.
  - Why unresolved: Asynchronous activation propagation on large symbolic graphs may incur latency issues not present in parallelized matrix operations used in deep learning.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks showing decision latency scaling linearly or sub-linearly with the size of the Logical Atom graph in a high-complexity simulation.

## Limitations

- The Logical Atom library and Initial Weight specifications are referenced but not fully disclosed, limiting reproducibility.
- The exact algorithms for Comparison operations and Relevance quantification remain unspecified.
- The mechanism for deriving Probability from Connection Strength is not fully detailed.
- No empirical results or ablation studies are provided to validate the architecture's performance against baseline models.

## Confidence

- **High**: The core mechanism of Weight = Benefit × Probability is clearly specified and traceable.
- **Medium**: The theoretical framework for explainability via atomic decomposition is well-articulated but lacks empirical validation.
- **Low**: Claims about intrinsic generality for novel situations and superiority over statistical pattern matching are not empirically tested.

## Next Checks

1. Implement a minimal Logical Atom graph and Weight-Calculation engine; reproduce the fire-escape moral dilemma and verify decision traceability to Initial Weights.
2. Conduct a scalability experiment: measure response latency as the Logical Atom library grows from 100 to 10,000 nodes.
3. Design a novel scenario (e.g., alien ecosystem) and test whether the system can generate relevant actions via analogical reasoning without prior training data.
