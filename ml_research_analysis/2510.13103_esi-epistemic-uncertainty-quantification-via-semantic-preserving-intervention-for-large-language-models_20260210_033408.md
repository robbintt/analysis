# ESI: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification via Semantic-preserving Intervention for Large Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13103
- Reference count: 40
- Method quantifies epistemic uncertainty by measuring model output stability under semantic-preserving interventions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ESI (Epistemic uncertainty quantification via Semantic-preserving Intervention), a novel approach for quantifying uncertainty in large language models. The method leverages the principle that reliable models should maintain stable outputs under semantic-preserving transformations of inputs. By measuring output variations before and after applying such interventions to prompts, ESI provides an effective estimate of epistemic uncertainty - the uncertainty arising from gaps in the model's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ESI outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods across multiple models and datasets while requiring fewer computational samples.

## Method Summary
ESI measures epistemic uncertainty by quantifying the average shift in token predictive distributions when semantic-preserving interventions are applied to prompts. The core insight is that a well-calibrated model should produce consistent outputs under interventions that preserve semantic meaning. The method computes the discrepancy between original and intervened model outputs, aggregating these differences to estimate uncertainty. This approach effectively isolates epistemic uncertainty by focusing on semantic invariance rather than total output variance. The technique demonstrates particular effectiveness on datasets with higher aleatoric uncertainty and open-book question answering tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency through reduced sample requirements.

## Key Results
- ESI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods across four models and five datasets
- Achieves superior performance in both effectiveness metrics and computational efficiency
- Shows larger improvements on datasets with higher aleatoric uncertainty and open-book QA tasks
- Requires fewer samples than baseline methods while maintaining high performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the relationship between model reliability and invariance under semantic-preserving transformations. When a model encounters semantically equivalent variations of the same prompt, a well-calibrated model should produce similar outputs. Variations in output distributions under such interventions indicate uncertainty stemming from the model's incomplete knowledge. By focusing specifically on semantic-preserving interventions, ESI isolates epistemic uncertainty from other sources like inherent data ambiguity. The average shift in token predictive distributions provides a quantitative measure of this uncertainty, with larger shifts indicating greater epistemic uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic preservation**: Understanding what constitutes semantically equivalent text transformations is crucial for applying appropriate interventions
  - Why needed: Ensures interventions isolate epistemic rather than other types of uncertainty
  - Quick check: Verify that transformed prompts maintain original meaning through human evaluation or semantic similarity metrics

- **Epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty**: Distinguishing between uncertainty from model knowledge gaps versus inherent data ambiguity
  - Why needed: Allows targeted improvement of model reliability rather than addressing irreducible uncertainty
  - Quick check: Test method performance on datasets with known aleatoric uncertainty characteristics

- **Token predictive distribution**: Understanding how language models generate probability distributions over vocabulary for each token position
  - Why needed: Forms the basis for measuring output shifts under interventions
  - Quick check: Compare distribution changes before and after interventions using KL divergence or similar metrics

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Prompt → Semantic-preserving Intervention Generator → Original Model → Output Distribution A → Output Distribution B → Uncertainty Score

**Critical path**: The core measurement pipeline involves generating semantic-preserving interventions for a prompt, running both original and intervened prompts through the LLM, comparing the resulting token predictive distributions, and aggregating the differences into an uncertainty score.

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades off intervention quality (more diverse and semantically accurate interventions yield better uncertainty estimates) against computational cost (more interventions improve accuracy but increase runtime). The authors optimize by requiring fewer samples while maintaining effectiveness.

**Failure signatures**: Poor uncertainty estimates occur when intervention sets lack semantic diversity, when interventions inadvertently introduce semantic shifts, or when the model exhibits overconfidence on semantically challenging inputs. The method may also conflate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in cases where semantic-preserving interventions still allow for multiple valid interpretations.

**First experiments**:
1. Measure uncertainty scores on synthetic datasets with known epistemic uncertainty levels
2. Compare uncertainty estimates against human annotations of answer confidence
3. Test sensitivity to intervention quality by varying the semantic preservation accuracy of applied transformations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and diversity of semantic-preserving interventions
- Difficulty in experimentally validating the separation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty
- Computational costs of generating and applying interventions at scale are not fully characterized
- Performance may degrade if intervention sets fail to capture the full semantic space

## Confidence
- **Effectiveness of ESI** (High): Well-supported by extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
- **Computational efficiency** (Medium): Sample efficiency demonstrated, but full pipeline costs not analyzed
- **Epistemic vs aleatoric separation** (Low): Theoretically motivated but difficult to validate experimentally

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the semantic preservation quality of interventions to quantify sensitivity of uncertainty estimates
2. Compare ESI uncertainty estimates against human annotations of uncertainty in controlled settings
3. Measure end-to-end computational costs including intervention generation and application across different dataset sizes
