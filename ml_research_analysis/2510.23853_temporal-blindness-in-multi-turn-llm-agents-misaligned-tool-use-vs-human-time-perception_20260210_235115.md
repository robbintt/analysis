# Temporal Blindness in Multi-Turn LLM Agents: Misaligned Tool Use vs. Human Time Perception

## Quick Facts

- Key outcome: LLMs exhibit temporal blindness in multi-turn contexts, failing to align tool-use decisions with human temporal perception despite timestamp inputs

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a fundamental challenge in multi-turn LLM agents: temporal blindness, where models fail to properly account for elapsed time between messages when deciding whether to call tools. This results in either stale decisions based on outdated context or unnecessary tool calls. The authors introduce TicToc, a dataset of 1800+ multi-turn trajectories across 76 scenarios, to evaluate how well models align with human temporal perception. Despite providing timestamps, even state-of-the-art models show poor alignment with human preferences (≤65% normalized alignment rate), and reasoning traces reveal minimal use of temporal cues. Targeted post-training methods like DPO significantly improve temporal awareness, highlighting the need for specific alignment strategies.

## Method Summary
The authors created TicToc, a dataset containing 1800+ multi-turn user-agent trajectories across 76 scenarios with varying time sensitivities. Each trajectory is annotated with human preferences for optimal tool-call decisions at each turn. The evaluation involved 18 different LLM models, testing their tool-use decisions with and without timestamp information. The researchers analyzed reasoning traces to understand how models process temporal information and tested various prompting strategies to improve alignment. They also evaluated targeted post-training approaches, particularly direct preference optimization (DPO), to enhance temporal awareness in the models.

## Key Results
- Models achieve ≤65% normalized alignment rate with human temporal perception even when provided timestamps
- Reasoning traces show minimal use of temporal cues in decision-making
- Prompting-based alignment strategies have limited effectiveness
- Post-training methods like DPO yield significant improvements in temporal awareness
- 18 models tested across 76 scenarios show consistent patterns of temporal blindness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Multi-turn LLM agents fail to incorporate elapsed time into their decision-making processes because they lack explicit temporal reasoning mechanisms. When context windows contain messages from different time points, models struggle to weigh the relevance of older information versus the need for updated data. The temporal blindness phenomenon occurs because standard training approaches don't adequately capture the dynamic nature of real-world tool-use scenarios where time significantly impacts decision quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal perception**: Understanding how humans perceive and value time in decision contexts - needed to establish human preference ground truth for evaluation
- **Tool-use alignment**: Measuring how well model decisions match human preferences - needed to quantify the temporal blindness problem
- **Multi-turn dynamics**: Modeling interactions across multiple conversational turns - needed to create realistic evaluation scenarios
- **Preference optimization**: Techniques like DPO for fine-tuning model behavior - needed to demonstrate potential solutions
- **Reasoning trace analysis**: Examining model thought processes - needed to understand why temporal blindness occurs
- **Dataset annotation**: Creating labeled training and evaluation data - needed to establish benchmarks for temporal awareness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: TicToc dataset -> Model evaluation pipeline -> Reasoning trace analysis -> Post-training optimization -> Performance metrics

**Critical Path**: Dataset creation → Model testing with timestamps → Analysis of reasoning patterns → Implementation of DPO fine-tuning → Measurement of alignment improvement

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study prioritizes realistic multi-turn scenarios over controlled single-turn experiments, sacrificing some experimental control for ecological validity. The use of human preference annotations provides realistic ground truth but introduces subjectivity. Focusing on timestamp-based solutions rather than architectural changes limits generalizability but provides practical insights.

**Failure Signatures**: Models consistently make stale decisions based on outdated context, show minimal temporal reasoning in traces, and fail to improve with simple timestamp prompts. Performance plateaus around 65% alignment regardless of model size or reasoning capability.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance on TicToc without any temporal information to establish baseline temporal blindness
2. Test the same models with explicit temporal reasoning prompts to assess prompting effectiveness
3. Apply DPO fine-tuning on a subset of TicToc data and measure alignment improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper raises several important questions about the nature of temporal blindness in LLMs. What architectural modifications could fundamentally address temporal reasoning limitations rather than relying on post-training alignment? How does temporal blindness manifest across different task domains and real-world applications beyond the controlled scenarios tested? What are the long-term implications for deploying multi-turn agents in time-sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, or autonomous systems?

## Limitations
- Human preference annotations introduce subjective variability without reported inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Analysis of reasoning traces lacks systematic probing to distinguish capability gaps from conditioning issues
- DPO improvements may be dataset-specific without evidence of generalization to real-world scenarios
- The study doesn't explore architectural modifications that might address temporal blindness at a fundamental level
- Limited exploration of how different temporal granularities (seconds vs minutes vs hours) affect model performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical finding that timestamped inputs do not significantly improve model alignment (≤65% normalized alignment rate) across 18 models is a direct, measurable outcome from controlled experiments.

**Medium Confidence**: The conclusion that "reasoning traces reveal minimal use of temporal cues" is likely accurate but limited by the methodology not being fully specified for reproducibility.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that this represents fundamental "temporal blindness" rather than a conditioning or prompting issue - the evidence shows poor performance but doesn't definitively establish that models lack temporal reasoning capabilities versus lacking proper temporal context utilization.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate the same 18 models on TicToc-derived data with varied temporal distributions and real-world multi-turn agent interactions to assess whether the temporal blindness pattern holds across different contexts and time scales.

2. **Controlled temporal reasoning probe**: Design systematic ablation experiments where models are explicitly prompted with temporal reasoning instructions versus baseline conditions, measuring whether temporal blindness persists even with direct temporal cues.

3. **Human evaluation triangulation**: Conduct independent human evaluations of the same tool-call decisions used in TicToc, measuring inter-annotator agreement and comparing with the original annotations to establish the reliability of the human temporal perception ground truth.
