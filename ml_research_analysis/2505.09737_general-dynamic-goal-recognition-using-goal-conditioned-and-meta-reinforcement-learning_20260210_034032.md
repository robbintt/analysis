- General Dynamic Goal Recognition (GDGR) extends classical goal recognition to handle changing goals and domains in real time using AURA framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces General Dynamic Goal Recognition (GDGR), which extends classical goal recognition to handle changing goals and domains in real time. The authors propose Adaptive Universal Recognition Algorithm (AURA) as a generic framework that adapts to new goals and domains via three phases: initialization, task-specific adaptation, and memory updates. Two RL-based implementations are presented: GC-AURA for goal adaptation and Meta-AURA for domain adaptation. Experiments on MiniGrid, PointMaze, and Panda-Gym show that AURA significantly reduces adaptation times compared to baselines like GRAQL and DRACO, achieving high recognition accuracy under low observability and high noise.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes Adaptive Universal Recognition Algorithm (AURA) as a generic framework for GDGR that operates in three phases: initialization (pre-training meta-policy or GCRL policy), task-specific adaptation (domain or goal adaptation), and memory updates (storing adapted policies). Two RL-based implementations are provided: GC-AURA uses goal-conditioned reinforcement learning with TRPO to enable zero-shot recognition of novel goals, while Meta-AURA uses MAML-TRPO to enable rapid adaptation to new domains. The recognition inference phase computes distances between observed trajectories and policy rollouts using Wasserstein distance for continuous spaces or KL-divergence for discrete spaces.

## Key Results
- GC-AURA reached perfect F-Score after 600 iterations without additional training, while DRACO required 400 iterations per goal
- Meta-AURA adapted to new goals in fewer than 10 fine-tuning iterations versus 100 for DRACO
- AURA achieved high recognition accuracy under 10% partial observability and 90% noise levels
- GC-AURA maintained robust performance without additional fine-tuning across noise levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Goal-conditioned policies trained over a continuous goal space enable zero-shot recognition of novel goals without additional fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: A GCRL policy π(a|s,g) learns to condition actions on arbitrary goal states g. At recognition time, the observed trajectory O is compared against policy rollouts for each candidate goal using Wasserstein distance. The goal minimizing this distance is selected.
- Core assumption: The goal space G is sufficiently covered during training such that novel goals lie near learned goal representations.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "GC-AURA maintained robust performance under 10% partial observability and 90% noise levels without additional fine-tuning." [section 4.1] "Zero-shot transfer: Directly use the existing GCRL policy without any additional training."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Meta-RL pre-training reduces adaptation iterations to novel domains by learning an initialization amenable to rapid gradient-based fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: MAML-TRPO trains a meta-policy across tasks sampled from p(D) with varying transitions τ and rewards R. The learned initialization θ* requires fewer gradient steps to adapt to a new domain than random initialization.
- Core assumption: Domains share state and action spaces, differing only in transition dynamics and reward functions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Meta-AURA achieved high recognition accuracy with 3.5x fewer iterations than training from scratch." [section 6.2] "Meta-AURA achieved high rewards after ≈ 10 fine-tuning TRPO iterations, while DRACO required ≈ 100 TRPO iterations."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Phased decomposition of GDGR (domain → goal → inference) with persistent memory enables incremental knowledge accumulation across recognition problems.
- Mechanism: Memory M stores domain-specific policies and goal-specific adaptations. Each phase reuses relevant memory components, amortizing upfront training costs across multiple GR problems in the same domain.
- Core assumption: GR problems arrive with exploitable temporal gaps between domain, goal, and observation availability.
- Evidence anchors: [section 4] "The components of a GR problem – domain, goals, and observations – are not assumed to arrive simultaneously. AURA is designed to conceptually take advantage of any time gaps." [section 3] Memory M_{t-1} is carried over from previous time steps for computing P(g|O_t, M_{t-1}).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Markov Decision Processes and GA-MDPs**
  - Why needed here: GDGR formulates domain theories as MDPs (S, A, τ, R) extended to goal-augmented MDPs with goal space G and mapping φ: S → G.
  - Quick check question: Can you write the GA-MDP objective J(π) and explain how the reward function differs from standard MDPs?

- Concept: **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**
  - Why needed here: Both GC-AURA and Meta-AURA implementations use TRPO as the base RL algorithm for policy optimization with stability guarantees.
  - Quick check question: What constraint does TRPO enforce during policy updates, and why does it matter for goal-conditioned policies?

- Concept: **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)**
  - Why needed here: Meta-AURA relies on MAML-TRPO to learn initial policy parameters that adapt quickly to new domains via gradient descent.
  - Quick check question: Explain the bi-level optimization in MAML—what happens in the inner loop vs. the outer loop?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: InitMemoryPhase -> DomainAdaptationPhase -> GoalsAdaptationPhase -> RecognitionInferencePhase -> UpdateMemoryPhase
- Critical path: InitMemoryPhase (once) -> DomainAdaptationPhase (per domain) -> GoalsAdaptationPhase (per goal set) -> RecognitionInferencePhase (per observation sequence)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - GC-AURA: Higher upfront training cost (~3.5x longer), but zero-shot goal adaptation; better noise robustness
  - Meta-AURA: Requires diverse meta-training domains; enables cross-domain transfer but assumes shared state/action spaces
  - Storage: GRAQL (tabular) has high storage; neural policies (TRPO/MAML) use compact weights
- Failure signatures:
  - Recognition accuracy degrades sharply under low observability (<10%) with insufficient training iterations
  - Meta-AURA fails when test domains differ qualitatively from meta-training distribution
  - GC-AURA struggles with high-dimensional goal spaces requiring goal space restriction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce GC-AURA on Panda-Gym: Train GC-TRPO over continuous goal space for 1400 iterations; evaluate recognition F-score at 10% observability with 0-90% noise. Verify zero-shot generalization to unseen goals.
  2. Reproduce Meta-AURA on MiniGrid: Train MAML-TRPO for 150 meta-iterations with varying lava configurations; fine-tune to new goals with 10-100 TRPO steps. Compare adaptation speed vs. training from scratch.
  3. Ablate memory persistence: Disable UpdateMemoryPhase and measure recognition degradation across sequential GDGR problems to quantify transfer benefit.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can Meta-RL and Goal-Conditioned RL be integrated within AURA to simultaneously handle real-time adaptation to both new goals and new domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We plan to further integrate Meta-RL and Goal-Conditioned RL to improve GDGR and reach real-time GR when new goals and domains are introduced on-the-fly"
- Why unresolved: Current implementations treat goal adaptation (GC-AURA) and domain adaptation (Meta-AURA) as separate mechanisms targeting different abstraction levels. No unified approach exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: An implementation combining both mechanisms, evaluated on GDGR problems where goals and domains change simultaneously, with comparable or better adaptation speed than individual mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does AURA perform in goal spaces with high dimensionality that may exceed the capacity of current goal-conditioned training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "GC-AURA assumes effective training across continuous goal spaces, though high-dimensional goals may require restricting the space for reliable learning."
- Why unresolved: Experiments only evaluated 2D (PointMaze) and 3D (Panda-Gym) goal spaces. The scalability to higher-dimensional goal representations remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation on domains with progressively higher goal dimensions, identifying failure points and quantifying any necessary goal space restrictions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can Meta-AURA be extended to handle domains with differing state and action spaces rather than requiring shared S and A?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] "Meta-AURA assumes GR domains share state and action spaces, varying only in transitions and rewards."
- Why unresolved: MAML-based meta-learning fundamentally requires shared parameter spaces. This constraint limits Meta-AURA's applicability to domains with fundamentally different representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Modified architecture (e.g., using domain embeddings, modular networks, or universal policies) demonstrating adaptation across domains with different state/action spaces.

## Limitations

- Goal encoding mechanism is not specified, which is critical for zero-shot recognition in GC-AURA
- Meta-training distribution diversity and coverage are not detailed, limiting assessment of cross-domain generalization claims
- Exact noise model implementation (observation corruption vs. action masking) remains unspecified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Domain adaptation benefits (Meta-AURA reduces fine-tuning iterations from ~100 to ~10), storage efficiency (neural policies vs. tabular), and phased architecture feasibility
- **Medium confidence**: Zero-shot goal recognition claims (requires exact goal encoding method), noise robustness under 10% observability (depends on noise implementation), and memory transfer benefits (lacks ablation study)
- **Low confidence**: Cross-domain generalization (insufficient evidence on qualitatively different domains), scalability to high-dimensional goal spaces (requires goal space restriction details)

## Next Checks

1. **Goal encoding ablation**: Test GC-AURA with different goal embedding methods (concatenation vs. goal network) to identify the critical implementation detail affecting zero-shot recognition.
2. **Noise implementation audit**: Precisely specify and implement the noise model (observation corruption vs. action masking) to verify claimed robustness at 90% noise levels.
3. **Memory transfer quantification**: Run sequential GR problems with and without UpdateMemoryPhase to measure the exact performance degradation, validating the amortization benefit.
