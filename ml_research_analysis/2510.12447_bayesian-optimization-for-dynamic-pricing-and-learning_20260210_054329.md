# Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12447
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes Bayesian Optimization methods for dynamic pricing that outperform state-of-the-art RL algorithms while requiring fewer assumptions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the dynamic pricing problem in two settings: infinite inventory and finite inventory with limited selling horizon. The authors propose a Gaussian Process-based nonparametric approach using Bayesian Optimization to model revenue as a black-box function of price, without assuming specific parametric forms. Their methods achieve sublinear regret O(T^(1/2) log^2 T) for infinite inventory and demonstrate superior performance compared to RL baselines (PPO, DDPG, SAC) in extensive experiments. The proposed algorithms, particularly the lightweight bucketed variant, offer computational efficiency improvements while maintaining strong revenue performance.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces BO-Inf for infinite inventory using GP regression with UCB acquisition, achieving sublinear regret through systematic price exploration-exploitation. For finite inventory, they propose GP-Fin-Model-Based which learns a GP-based transition model with value iteration, and BO-Fin-Heuristic which directly estimates expected cumulative revenue. The LightweightBO-Inf variant uses bucketing to reduce GP training complexity from O(N^3) to O(B^3). Theoretical regret bounds are provided for infinite inventory and both finite inventory algorithms, with experimental validation showing BO methods outperform RL baselines in revenue and convergence speed while requiring fewer assumptions about demand structure.

## Key Results
- BO-based methods achieve sublinear regret O(T^(1/2) log^2 T) for infinite inventory setting
- BO methods outperform PPO, DDPG, and SAC in revenue performance and convergence speed
- BO-Fin-Heuristic particularly effective in large state spaces, avoiding error accumulation from imperfect demand modeling
- Methods demonstrate robustness across various demand structures (polynomial, exponential, scarcity-driven)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by treating the revenue function as a black-box to be learned through Bayesian Optimization rather than assuming parametric forms. Gaussian Processes provide uncertainty quantification that enables principled exploration-exploitation trade-offs. The UCB acquisition function naturally balances trying promising prices with exploring uncertain regions. For finite inventory, the heuristic approach bypasses complex value iteration by directly optimizing expected cumulative revenue, avoiding error propagation from imperfect demand modeling.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussian Processes** - Probabilistic models providing both predictions and uncertainty estimates. Needed for principled exploration-exploitation trade-offs in unknown environments. Quick check: kernel choice and hyperparameters significantly impact performance.

**Bayesian Optimization** - Sequential optimization framework using probabilistic surrogate models. Needed to handle the black-box nature of revenue functions without parametric assumptions. Quick check: acquisition function design critically affects convergence rate.

**Dynamic Programming** - Value iteration for sequential decision making under uncertainty. Needed for finite inventory setting with state transitions. Quick check: computational complexity scales poorly with state space size.

**Regret Analysis** - Framework for quantifying cumulative performance loss relative to optimal policy. Needed to provide theoretical performance guarantees. Quick check: regret bounds depend on smoothness assumptions of underlying functions.

**Nonparametric Methods** - Statistical approaches without fixed functional forms. Needed to handle unknown demand structures without restrictive assumptions. Quick check: model complexity grows with data, requiring careful regularization.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Demand Function -> Gaussian Process -> Acquisition Function -> Price Selection -> Revenue Observation -> Update GP

**Critical Path:** Price selection through BO acquisition → market response → GP update → new acquisition → repeat

**Design Tradeoffs:** GP flexibility vs computational complexity, exploration-exploitation balance, parametric assumptions vs model misspecification

**Failure Signatures:** Poor kernel choice leading to slow learning, insufficient exploration causing premature convergence, bucketing granularity too coarse for fine pricing optimization

**First Experiments:** 1) Compare different kernel functions (RBF, Matérn) on synthetic demand curves, 2) Test bucketing strategies (number of buckets, bucket boundaries) for LightweightBO-Inf, 3) Validate regret bounds on simple polynomial demand functions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical regret bounds for finite inventory setting are less explicit and may rely on strong assumptions
- Bucketing strategy in LightweightBO-Inf could miss optimal prices between buckets
- GP methods may struggle with highly discontinuous or multi-modal demand functions
- Computational improvements from bucketing may come at cost of solution quality when B << N

## Confidence

**Theoretical Guarantees:**
- Infinite inventory regret bound (O(T^(1/2) log^2 T)): High
- Finite inventory theoretical guarantees: Low-Medium

**Computational Claims:**
- Complexity improvement O(N^3) to O(B^3): Medium

**Experimental Results:**
- Superiority over RL methods: Medium
- Heuristic-based finite inventory approach: High

## Next Checks

1. Test BO-Fin-Heuristic performance when demand functions exhibit strong non-stationarity or regime shifts
2. Evaluate the impact of bucket size B on LightweightBO-Inf revenue performance across varying inventory levels
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing different kernel choices and hyperparameters for the GP models in both settings
