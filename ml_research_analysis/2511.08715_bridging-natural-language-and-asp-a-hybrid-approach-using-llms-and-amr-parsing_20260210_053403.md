# Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.08715
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Novel hybrid system translates English logic puzzles into runnable ASP code using LLMs for fact extraction and AMR parsing for constraint generation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hybrid approach that automatically translates unconstrained English descriptions of logic puzzles into Answer Set Programming (ASP) code. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract facts and identify relationships with Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to systematically generate ASP constraints. By minimizing the LLM's role to reduce hallucination risks, the approach successfully generates complete, runnable ASP programs that solve example puzzles like "Day-at-the-Zoo" and "Einstein's Riddle" with accurate results matching expected outputs.

## Method Summary
The hybrid approach processes natural language logic puzzles through a multi-stage pipeline. First, the LLM extracts relevant facts and relationships from the problem description while avoiding complex reasoning tasks that could lead to hallucinations. The AMR parser then converts each constraint sentence into structured semantic representations. These AMR graphs are systematically traversed to generate corresponding ASP constraints, with the system using predefined templates to map semantic structures to choice rules and integrity constraints. The LLM's role is deliberately limited to straightforward tasks like keyword identification and simple fact generation, while the AMR component handles the more complex logical structure translation.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated complete, runnable ASP programs from English logic puzzle descriptions
- Correct solutions obtained for "Day-at-the-Zoo" and "Einstein's Riddle" puzzles matching expected outputs
- Demonstrated accurate translation of natural language constraints into valid ASP choice rules and integrity constraints
- Showed potential for creating lighter, more explainable systems for converting natural language to logic problem solvers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages complementary strengths of LLMs and formal semantic parsing. LLMs excel at identifying relevant information and extracting facts from unstructured text, while AMR parsing provides systematic, rule-based translation of semantic structures into formal logic. By constraining the LLM to simple extraction tasks and using AMR for constraint generation, the system minimizes hallucination risks while maintaining accuracy. The hybrid design allows each component to operate within its strengths: the LLM handles the linguistic understanding and fact identification, while the AMR parser ensures precise logical translation.

## Foundational Learning

**AMR Parsing** - Abstract Meaning Representation provides a semantic graph structure that captures the meaning of sentences independent of their syntactic form. This is needed to systematically translate natural language into formal logic constraints. Quick check: Can the AMR correctly represent complex relationships like "if X then Y" or "exactly one of Z"?

**Answer Set Programming (ASP)** - A declarative programming paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning about complex problems. Needed as the target formalism for encoding logic puzzles. Quick check: Does the generated ASP correctly model the puzzle constraints and produce valid solutions?

**Hybrid AI Systems** - Combining neural approaches (LLMs) with symbolic methods (AMR parsing) to leverage complementary strengths. Needed to balance the flexibility of language models with the precision of formal methods. Quick check: Does the hybrid approach reduce errors compared to using either component alone?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Text -> LLM (Fact Extraction) -> AMR Parser -> Constraint Generator -> ASP Code

**Critical Path:** The system's core workflow processes each constraint sentence through AMR parsing to generate ASP constraints, with the LLM providing supporting fact extraction and relationship identification.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades the LLM's reasoning capabilities for reduced hallucination risk by limiting its role to extraction tasks. This increases reliability but may miss complex implicit relationships that a more capable LLM could infer.

**Failure Signatures:** AMR parsing failures propagate directly to incorrect ASP constraints, as there's no error correction mechanism. Synonym mismatches in the input can cause information loss if the LLM doesn't standardize terminology during simplification.

**First Experiments:** 
1. Test with simple puzzles containing only explicit constraints to verify basic functionality
2. Introduce synonym variation in inputs to test terminology handling
3. Create adversarial inputs with subtle polarity changes to test AMR robustness
