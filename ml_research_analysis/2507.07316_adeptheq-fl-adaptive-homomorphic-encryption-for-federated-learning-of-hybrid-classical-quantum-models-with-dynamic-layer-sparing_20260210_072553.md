# AdeptHEQ-FL: Adaptive Homomorphic Encryption for Federated Learning of Hybrid Classical-Quantum Models with Dynamic Layer Sparing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07316
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07316
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves 25.43% and 14.17% accuracy improvements over Standard-FedQNN and FHE-FedQNN respectively on CIFAR-10

## Executive Summary
AdeptHEQ-FL introduces an adaptive framework for federated learning of hybrid classical-quantum models that addresses key challenges in non-IID data distribution, privacy vulnerabilities, and communication overhead. The framework integrates a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture with adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation using differentially private validation accuracies and selective homomorphic encryption for final layer protection. It employs dynamic layer-wise freezing to reduce communication overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. The approach achieves significant accuracy improvements while maintaining privacy and efficiency through adaptive aggregation and selective encryption mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture where classical CNN layers process initial feature extraction while quantum PQC layers handle complex feature interactions. Local models are trained on client devices with non-IID data, then parameters are aggregated using an adaptive weighted averaging scheme based on validation accuracies with differential privacy. Homomorphic encryption is selectively applied to quantum circuit parameters during aggregation to ensure privacy. Dynamic layer-wise freezing is implemented to freeze less critical layers based on contribution scores, reducing communication overhead. The framework uses adaptive aggregation that assigns weights to local models based on validation performance with differential privacy noise injection.

## Key Results
- Achieves 25.43% accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN on CIFAR-10
- Achieves 14.17% accuracy improvement over FHE-FedQNN on CIFAR-10
- Reduces communication overhead through dynamic layer-wise freezing while maintaining quantum adaptability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-layered approach to addressing federated learning challenges. The hybrid architecture leverages classical CNNs for robust feature extraction while PQCs handle complex quantum feature interactions. Adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation ensures that better-performing models contribute more to the global model, while differential privacy protects individual client contributions. Selective homomorphic encryption secures quantum parameters without excessive computational overhead. Dynamic layer-wise freezing optimizes communication efficiency by identifying and freezing less critical layers based on their contribution to overall model performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Federated Learning** - Distributed machine learning where multiple clients train local models and aggregate parameters without sharing raw data
*Why needed*: Enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning across decentralized data sources
*Quick check*: Verify understanding of parameter aggregation vs. data sharing

**Homomorphic Encryption** - Cryptographic technique allowing computation on encrypted data without decryption
*Why needed*: Enables secure aggregation of quantum parameters while preserving privacy
*Quick check*: Confirm understanding of partial vs. full homomorphic encryption trade-offs

**Parameterized Quantum Circuits** - Quantum circuits with trainable parameters that can be optimized for specific tasks
*Why needed*: Provides quantum advantage for complex feature interactions while maintaining trainability
*Quick check*: Verify understanding of quantum circuit parameterization and training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Client devices -> Local training -> Parameter encryption -> Aggregation server -> Global model update -> Dynamic freezing -> New round

**Critical Path**: Local training with non-IID data → Adaptive weighted aggregation with differential privacy → Selective HE encryption of quantum parameters → Dynamic layer-wise freezing based on contribution scores

**Design Tradeoffs**: Selective HE vs. full HE encryption balances security with computational efficiency; adaptive aggregation vs. equal weighting balances fairness with performance optimization; dynamic freezing vs. static architecture balances communication efficiency with model flexibility

**Failure Signatures**: Accuracy degradation when non-IID data distribution exceeds adaptive aggregation's compensation capability; increased communication overhead when dynamic freezing misidentifies critical layers; privacy breaches when selective HE coverage is insufficient for quantum parameter protection

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison on CIFAR-10 with Standard-FedQNN and FHE-FedQNN
2. Ablation study testing individual components (adaptive aggregation, selective HE, layer freezing)
3. Communication overhead measurement across different federated learning topologies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on CIFAR-10 dataset, limiting generalizability to other domains and real-world federated learning scenarios
- Performance claims rely heavily on simulation-based federated learning environments without testing in practical deployment conditions
- Limited ablation studies on the impact of each individual component on overall performance

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework and architectural design choices
- Medium confidence in reported accuracy improvements due to simulation-only validation
- Medium confidence in communication efficiency claims without real-world deployment testing

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate framework performance across diverse datasets (medical imaging, natural language processing) and federated learning topologies
2. Conduct real-world deployment testing with actual quantum hardware simulators to measure end-to-end performance and resource utilization
3. Perform comprehensive ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of adaptive aggregation, selective encryption, and layer freezing mechanisms
