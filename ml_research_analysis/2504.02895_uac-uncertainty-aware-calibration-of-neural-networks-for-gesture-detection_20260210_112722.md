# UAC: Uncertainty-Aware Calibration of Neural Networks for Gesture Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.02895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02895
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: UAC achieves 11% accuracy improvement on Wisdm dataset with ECE of 0.103 vs 0.157 for temperature scaling

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurate and calibrated gesture recognition using only IMU sensor data, particularly in safety-critical domains like construction where out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios are common. The proposed method, UAC (Uncertainty-Aware Calibration), introduces a two-step approach: first, an uncertainty-aware neural network predicts both gesture probabilities and associated uncertainties from IMU data using Monte Carlo integration; second, multiple predictions from different IMU data windows are combined using entropy-weighted expectation to improve accuracy while maintaining calibration. The method was evaluated on three public IMU gesture recognition datasets (Wisdm, Samosa, USCHAD) and compared against three state-of-the-art calibration methods (temperature scaling, entropy maximization, and Laplace approximation). UAC achieved 11% accuracy improvement on the Wisdm dataset compared to the second-best method and demonstrated significantly better calibration metrics (ECE of 0.103 vs 0.157 for temperature scaling) in OOD scenarios.

## Method Summary
UAC employs a two-step approach for gesture detection from IMU data. First, it trains an uncertainty-aware neural network that predicts both gesture probabilities and associated uncertainties using Monte Carlo integration. The network processes sliding windows of IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope readings) to capture temporal patterns in gestures. Second, UAC combines multiple predictions from different IMU windows using entropy-weighted expectation, giving more weight to predictions with lower uncertainty. This approach explicitly models the relationship between prediction confidence and accuracy, allowing the system to recognize when it is uncertain about a gesture classification. The method was evaluated on three public IMU gesture recognition datasets and compared against state-of-the-art calibration methods including temperature scaling, entropy maximization, and Laplace approximation.

## Key Results
- UAC achieved 11% accuracy improvement on Wisdm dataset compared to the second-best method (temperature scaling)
- Demonstrated significantly better calibration metrics with ECE of 0.103 vs 0.157 for temperature scaling
- Showed particular effectiveness in out-of-distribution scenarios common in safety-critical applications
- Ablation studies confirmed the importance of both uncertainty prediction and entropy-weighted expectation components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The UAC method works by explicitly modeling uncertainty in gesture predictions and using this uncertainty information to improve calibration and accuracy. Traditional neural networks produce point estimates without quantifying their confidence, which can lead to overconfident predictions in OOD scenarios. UAC's uncertainty-aware network uses Monte Carlo integration to generate multiple predictions for the same input, allowing it to estimate the variance of predictions as a measure of uncertainty. By combining predictions from multiple IMU windows with weights based on their entropy (uncertainty), the method gives more influence to confident predictions while downweighting uncertain ones. This approach naturally handles the inherent variability in IMU data and the possibility of OOD inputs in real-world applications.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: IMU data -> Sliding window processor -> Uncertainty-aware NN -> Multiple predictions -> Entropy weighting -> Combined prediction

Critical path: IMU input → Window extraction → Monte Carlo sampling → Prediction aggregation → Entropy-weighted combination

Design tradeoffs:
- Monte Carlo integration vs analytical uncertainty estimation (computational vs accuracy tradeoff)
- Window size selection balancing temporal context vs computational efficiency
- Single model vs ensemble approach for uncertainty estimation

Failure signatures:
- Poor calibration when input distribution significantly differs from training data
- High computational overhead due to Monte Carlo sampling
- Degraded performance when IMU sampling rate is inconsistent

3 first experiments:
1. Replicate calibration comparison on a single dataset (Wisdm) to verify core claims
2. Test uncertainty estimation quality by comparing predicted uncertainty to actual prediction accuracy
3. Evaluate sensitivity to window size by testing multiple configurations on calibration metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Exclusive focus on IMU sensor data without addressing multimodal approaches that could provide complementary information
- Evaluation confined to three public datasets, raising questions about generalizability to other domains or more complex gesture vocabularies
- No extensive analysis of computational overhead or real-time performance implications for safety-critical applications
- Monte Carlo integration approach may introduce latency impacting practical usability in time-sensitive scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core claims about UAC's effectiveness in improving calibration and accuracy on the three tested datasets are well-supported by the experimental results presented
- Medium confidence: The claim that UAC is particularly beneficial for OOD scenarios is supported but could benefit from more extensive OOD testing across different types of distribution shifts
- Medium confidence: The assertion that UAC outperforms existing calibration methods needs validation on additional datasets and with more diverse model architectures

## Next Checks
1. Test UAC on additional IMU gesture datasets with different characteristics (e.g., larger gesture vocabularies, varying sampling rates) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate computational latency and real-time performance to determine practical deployment feasibility in safety-critical applications
3. Implement a multimodal extension combining IMU data with complementary sensor inputs (e.g., video or radar) to assess potential performance gains in more complex scenarios
