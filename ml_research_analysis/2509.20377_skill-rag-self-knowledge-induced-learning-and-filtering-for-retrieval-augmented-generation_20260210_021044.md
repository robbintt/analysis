# SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20377
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377
- Authors: Tomoaki Isoda
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Addresses hallucinations in retrieval-augmented generation through self-knowledge filtering of retrieved content

## Executive Summary
SKILL-RAG introduces a novel approach to reduce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by leveraging a model's self-knowledge to filter irrelevant retrieved content. The method employs reinforcement learning to elicit self-knowledge from the model, using sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving useful knowledge. The approach aims to improve generation quality and context efficiency by effectively integrating internal and external knowledge through self-knowledge modeling.

## Method Summary
SKILL-RAG addresses hallucination problems in RAG systems through a reinforcement learning-based training framework that elicits self-knowledge from the model. The method uses entropy-weighted advantage functions and self-knowledge-guided document filtering based on pointwise mutual information. The approach operates at sentence-level granularity to filter retrieved documents, training the model to recognize its own knowledge boundaries. This allows the system to distinguish between content it already knows and content that needs to be retrieved, thereby reducing the input of irrelevant documents while preserving useful knowledge for generation.

## Key Results
- Achieves accuracy scores ranging from 52.5% to 73.0% across four QA benchmarks (TriviaQA, SelfAware, NQ, TruthfulQA)
- Demonstrates competitive performance compared to baseline RAG systems
- Significantly reduces the number of input documents through effective filtering
- Improves generation quality by integrating internal and external knowledge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by training the model to recognize its own knowledge boundaries through reinforcement learning, allowing it to filter irrelevant retrieved content at sentence-level granularity. By eliciting self-knowledge through entropy-weighted advantage functions, the model learns to identify what it already knows versus what needs to be retrieved. The self-knowledge-guided filtering using pointwise mutual information ensures that only relevant external knowledge is incorporated, reducing hallucinations caused by irrelevant or contradictory information in retrieved documents.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Reinforcement Learning for Self-Knowledge Elicitation**: Needed to train models to recognize their own knowledge boundaries. Quick check: Verify reward functions properly incentivize accurate self-knowledge recognition.
2. **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for Document Filtering**: Required to measure the relevance between retrieved sentences and the query context. Quick check: Confirm PMI scores correlate with human relevance judgments.
3. **Entropy-Weighted Advantage Functions**: Essential for balancing exploration and exploitation during self-knowledge training. Quick check: Validate that entropy weighting prevents premature convergence to suboptimal knowledge boundaries.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Query -> Retriever -> Self-Knowledge Module -> Filter -> Generator

**Critical Path**: The system processes queries through a retriever to obtain documents, then passes them through the self-knowledge module which uses entropy-weighted advantage functions to evaluate relevance, applies PMI-based filtering at sentence level, and finally generates responses using the filtered context.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Sentence-level filtering provides finer granularity than document-level approaches but increases computational overhead. The reinforcement learning approach for self-knowledge elicitation requires careful reward design to avoid overfitting to specific query patterns.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when self-knowledge boundaries are incorrectly learned (overly confident or uncertain), when PMI calculations misidentify relevant content, or when the entropy weighting becomes unbalanced, leading to either excessive filtering or insufficient noise reduction.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study comparing sentence-level vs document-level filtering on retrieval accuracy
2. Analysis of self-knowledge entropy distributions across different query types
3. Validation of PMI relevance scores against human annotator judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of baseline comparisons and statistical significance testing makes performance claims difficult to evaluate
- Missing quantitative metrics on document count reduction and efficiency gains
- Insufficient implementation details for replication, particularly around reward functions and hyperparameters
- Limited model and dataset diversity raises questions about generalizability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The technical contribution of incorporating self-knowledge mechanisms for content filtering is valid and represents a meaningful advancement in RAG systems.

**Medium Confidence**: The claims about improved generation quality are plausible but lack comparative analysis and statistical validation to confirm significance.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion of significant computational efficiency improvements is not supported by concrete metrics or evidence.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing SKILL-RAG against standard RAG baselines on the same datasets with statistical significance testing to quantify performance improvements.

2. Measure and report concrete efficiency metrics including average document count reduction, inference time, and memory usage to validate computational benefits.

3. Test the approach across a broader range of model sizes and diverse application domains beyond QA to assess generalizability and scalability.
