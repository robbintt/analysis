# Parameter-free Algorithms for the Stochastically Extended Adversarial Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.04685
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04685
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First parameter-free algorithms for SEA model achieving regret bounds scaling with problem-specific quantities σ²₁:ₜ and Σ²₁:ₜ without prior knowledge of D or G

## Executive Summary
This paper develops the first parameter-free algorithms for the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model, which bridges adversarial and stochastic online convex optimization. The key innovation is leveraging Optimistic Online Newton Step (OONS) to eliminate dependence on prior knowledge of domain diameter D and Lipschitz constant G. The authors develop two algorithms: CA-OONS for unknown D (but known G) and CLA-OONS for both D and G unknown, achieving regret bounds that depend on problem-specific quantities rather than unknown parameters.

## Method Summary
The paper presents three algorithms building on OONS. CA-OONS uses a multi-scale ensemble of base learners with MsMwC meta-algorithm to handle unknown domain diameter. CLA-OONS adds gradient truncation and domain doubling to handle unknown Lipschitz constants. Both algorithms maintain the adaptive second-order preconditioning of OONS while eliminating parameter dependence through meta-learning and adaptive clipping strategies.

## Key Results
- CA-OONS achieves E[RT(u)] = Õ(∥u∥₂² + ∥u∥₂(√σ²₁:ₜ + √Σ²₁:ₜ)) for unknown D
- CLA-OONS achieves E[RT(u)] ≤ Õ(∥u∥₂²(√σ²₁:ₜ + √Σ²₁:ₜ) + G²∥u∥₂² + ∥u∥₄² + G∥u∥₃²/₂ + G²√σ₁:ₜ + G₁:ₜ) for both D and G unknown
- Both algorithms maintain effectiveness without requiring prior knowledge of problem parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Adaptive Second-Order Preconditioning with Optimistic Updates
OONS eliminates parameter dependence by using accumulated gradient statistics to automatically scale updates. The algorithm maintains a preconditioning matrix $A_t = 4z_1^2 I + \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} \eta_s(\nabla_s - m_s)(\nabla_s - m_s)^\top$ that accumulates second-order information from gradient deviations. The adaptive step-size $\eta_t = \min\{1/(64Dz_T), 1/D\sqrt{\sum_{s=1}^{t-1}\|g_s - m_s\|_2^2}\}$ automatically adjusts based on cumulative gradient variation, eliminating the need to know problem parameters a priori.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Scale Ensemble with Scale-Sensitive Meta-Learning
Unknown domain diameter is handled by running multiple base learners at geometrically increasing scales, with a meta-algorithm that adaptively weights them based on performance. Create $N = \lceil \log T \rceil$ base learners, each operating within constrained domain $X_j = \{x : \|x\|_2 \leq D_j = 2^j\}$. The MsMwC meta-algorithm maintains weights $w_t \in \Delta_N$ over learners, using the expert set $\mathcal{S} = \{k \in \mathbb{Z} : \exists j \in [N], GD_j \leq 2^{k-2} \leq GD_j\sqrt{T}\}$ to handle multi-scale loss ranges.

### Mechanism 3: Gradient Truncation with Adaptive Range Estimation
Unknown Lipschitz constants are handled by clipping gradients to adaptively estimated ranges, with domain doubling to handle comparator scale. Maintain running estimate $B_t = \max_{0 \leq s \leq t} \|g_s - m_s\|_2$ of gradient range. Construct truncated gradient $\hat{g}_t = m_t + \frac{B_{t-1}}{B_t}(g_t - m_t)$ satisfying $\|\hat{g}_t - m_t\|_2 \leq B_{t-1}$, allowing the algorithm to assume known bounds at each step.

## Foundational Learning

- **Online Convex Optimization (OCO) and Regret**: Sequential decision-making framework where learner selects xt, receives convex loss ft, and aims to minimize regret RT(u) = ∑ft(xt) - ∑ft(u). Essential for understanding SEA model extensions.
  - Quick check: Explain why minimax optimal regret for convex losses is O(√T), and what additional structure allows O(√σ²₁:ₜ + √Σ²₁:ₜ) bounds in the SEA model.

- **Bregman Divergences and Mirror Descent**: OONS updates use Bregman divergences D_ψ(x, y) = ψ(x) - ψ(y) - ⟨∇ψ(y), x-y⟩ with ψt(x) = ½‖x‖²At. Lemma C.1 (Bregman proximal inequality) is the workhorse for regret decomposition.
  - Quick check: Derive why ⟨gt, x_{t+1} - u⟩ ≤ D_ψ(u, xt) - D_ψ(u, x_{t+1}) - D_ψ(xt, x_{t+1}) holds for Bregman proximal updates.

- **Optimistic Learning and the RVU Property**: The paper achieves σ²₁:ₜ-scaling through the RVU (Regret bounded by Variation in Utilities) property, which requires understanding how optimistic predictions mt enable finer regret control than standard OMD.
  - Quick check: What is the RVU property (regret bounded by α + β∑‖ut - ut-1‖² - γ∑‖xt - xt-1‖²), and why does the negative stability term -γ∑‖xt - xt-1‖² enable conversion from eσ²₁:ₜ to preferred σ²₁:ₜ bounds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: OONS core (Layer 1) -> Multi-scale ensemble (Layer 2) -> MsMwC meta-algorithm (Layer 3) -> MsMwC-Master (Layer 4) -> CLA-OONS additions (gradient truncation, domain doubling)
- **Critical path**: 1) Implement vanilla ONS with fixed η, verify O(√T) regret; 2) Add adaptive ηt per equation (4), verify matches Theorem 3.2 on SEA instances; 3) Implement multi-scale ensemble (N base OONS), verify single-expert selection when ‖u‖₂ known; 4) Add MsMwC meta-algorithm (both layers), verify Theorem 4.1 scaling with ‖u‖₂; 5) Add gradient truncation and domain doubling, verify CLA-OONS handles unknown G
- **Design tradeoffs**: Computation vs Adaptivity (O(d²) matrix operations), Ensemble Size vs Granularity (N=⌈log T⌉ sufficient), Restart Frequency vs Stability (O(log T) restarts in CLA-OONS), eO(·) Hide vs Transparency (calibrate constants via benchmarks)
- **Failure signatures**: Regret exceeds eO(‖u‖₂√(σ² + Σ²)) significantly (check step-size constraint), Meta-algorithm concentrates on wrong scale (verify expert set S), Numerical overflow in At (ensure regularization provides conditioning), Domain restarts too frequent (verify doubling condition)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline OONS validation on synthetic linear losses with controlled stochastic/adversarial components; 2) CA-OONS scale adaptation with varying ‖u‖₂ ∈ {1, 10, 100, 1000}; 3) CLA-OONS stress test with unknown Lipschitz G ∈ {1, 10, 100} unknown to algorithm

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Can the regret's dependence on ∥u∥₂ be improved from ∥u∥₂² to ∥u∥₂ in the CLA-OONS algorithm when both D and G are unknown?
- Can the number of gradient queries in CA-OONS be reduced from O(log T) to O(1) per round?
- Can a single algorithm simultaneously achieve both Õ(∥u∥₂² + ∥u∥₂(√σ²₁:ₜ + √Σ²₁:ₜ)) for smooth functions and Õ(∥u∥₂G√T) worst-case regret?
- Can high-probability regret guarantees be derived for the SEA model in the parameter-free setting?

## Limitations

- Theoretical scope limited to bounded variation assumptions on gradients and convexity of losses
- No empirical validation provided to assess practical performance or computational overhead
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters like z₁ initialization and impact of O(d²) per-step complexity not characterized

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Theoretical regret bounds for OONS (Theorem 3.2) are well-established through Bregman divergence analysis
- **Medium confidence**: Multi-scale ensemble approach in CA-OONS (Theorem 4.1) has solid theoretical foundation but practical effectiveness depends on meta-algorithm
- **Low confidence**: Gradient truncation mechanism in CLA-OONS (Theorem 4.5) introduces approximation errors difficult to characterize precisely

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation on synthetic SEA problems**: Implement the three algorithms and test on synthetic convex losses with controlled stochastic and adversarial components. Measure actual regret against theoretical bounds, particularly focusing on how well the algorithms adapt to unknown parameters D and G.

2. **Numerical stability and computational overhead analysis**: Systematically evaluate the condition number of the matrix At over time, the frequency of domain restarts in CLA-OONS, and the computational cost of maintaining N base learners in CA-OONS. Compare practical per-step complexity against standard OCO algorithms.

3. **Robustness to assumption violations**: Test the algorithms on problems where key assumptions are violated: non-convex losses, heavy-tailed gradient distributions, and full-information settings where only stochastic gradients are available. Measure performance degradation and identify which components are most sensitive.
