# Arabic Large Language Models for Medical Text Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.10095
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10095
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Primary result**: Fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 achieves 68.5% F1 score on Arabic medical text generation using LoRA fine-tuning and BERTScore evaluation

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of generating accurate medical text in Arabic by fine-tuning large language models on a curated dataset of 20,000 Arabic question-answer pairs from social media. The research demonstrates that LoRA-based fine-tuning can effectively adapt models like Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to produce contextually appropriate medical advice while handling dialectal variations. The approach shows promise for real-time medical advice systems in linguistically diverse environments where standard Arabic medical resources are limited.

## Method Summary
The researchers constructed a dataset of 20,000 Arabic QA pairs from Facebook medical groups, preprocessing to remove noise, normalize dialects, and handle informal text. They fine-tuned five different models including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, AraGPT2-Base, BLOOM-560M, and GPT-2 Medium using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) through Hugging Face Transformers. The training used batch size 8, warmup steps of 200, cosine learning rate scheduling, and FP16 precision. Evaluation was performed using BERTScore to measure semantic similarity between generated and reference medical responses.

## Key Results
- Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 achieved the best performance with BERTScore F1 of 68.5%
- The model showed strong recall (69.08%) while maintaining competitive precision (68.5%)
- Dialectal normalization preprocessing was critical for handling informal Arabic medical text

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning by learning low-rank updates to the model's weight matrices rather than full parameter updates, making it computationally feasible to adapt large models to specialized domains. BERTScore provides semantic evaluation that captures meaning similarity beyond exact token matching, which is crucial for medical text where paraphrases are common. The combination of dialect-aware preprocessing with LoRA fine-tuning allows the model to maintain both linguistic diversity and medical accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that approximates weight updates using low-rank matrices - needed for adapting large models with limited compute; quick check: verify rank r=8 works better than r=4 or r=16
- **BERTScore**: Evaluation metric using contextual embeddings to compute precision/recall/F1 between candidate and reference texts - needed because medical text often uses paraphrases; quick check: ensure Arabic-specific BERT model is used
- **Dialect normalization**: Preprocessing technique to standardize regional Arabic variations - needed because social media medical text contains multiple dialects; quick check: test model performance with/without dialect normalization
- **FP16 training**: Mixed-precision training to reduce memory usage - needed for fitting 7B models on consumer GPUs; quick check: verify gradient overflow doesn't occur
- **Cosine learning rate schedule**: Dynamic learning rate adjustment that starts with warmup then decreases - needed for stable convergence in LoRA fine-tuning; quick check: plot loss curves to verify proper scheduling
- **Social media text preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing informal text with emojis, ads, and typos - needed because medical discussions occur in unstructured formats; quick check: sample 100 posts to verify cleaning effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Raw social media posts -> Preprocessing pipeline -> LoRA adapter -> Fine-tuned LLM -> BERTScore evaluation
- **Critical path**: Data preprocessing → LoRA fine-tuning → BERTScore evaluation determines final model selection
- **Design tradeoffs**: LoRA vs full fine-tuning (parameter efficiency vs potential performance), BERTScore vs human evaluation (scalability vs clinical accuracy), dialect normalization vs preserving regional specificity
- **Failure signatures**: OOM errors during training indicate batch size too large for GPU memory; BERTScore variance suggests dataset quality issues; poor dialect handling shows garbled outputs with mixed script
- **Three first experiments**:
  1. Train LoRA adapter on 1,000 samples with different ranks (r=4,8,16) to establish baseline performance
  2. Compare BERTScore using bert-base-arabic vs xlm-roberta-base to determine best checkpoint
  3. Test dialect normalization effectiveness by training identical models with and without preprocessing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset unavailability prevents exact reproduction as specific Facebook groups and annotation schemas are not disclosed
- Key hyperparameters including learning rate, epochs, and LoRA settings are unspecified
- Clinical validation of generated medical advice was not performed, limiting real-world safety assessment

## Confidence
- **Dataset reproducibility**: Low confidence - social media dataset not publicly available
- **Methodological soundness**: Medium confidence - standard LoRA + BERTScore approach is well-established
- **Numerical results**: Low confidence - exact hyperparameters unknown, making replication uncertain
- **Practical utility**: Medium confidence - BERTScore results are promising but require clinical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Conduct systematic sweeps of LoRA rank (r=4,8,16), learning rate (1e-5 to 1e-4), and epochs (3-10) on a smaller subset to establish baseline performance sensitivity
2. **BERTScore reproducibility test**: Fine-tune Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 on an alternative publicly available Arabic medical QA dataset and compare BERTScore metrics to establish lower bounds
3. **Dialect robustness evaluation**: Manually annotate a small subset of test samples for dialectal features and measure performance degradation across different Arabic dialect regions to validate normalization effectiveness
