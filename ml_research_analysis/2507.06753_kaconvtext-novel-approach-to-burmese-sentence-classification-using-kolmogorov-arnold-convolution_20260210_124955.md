# KAConvText: Novel Approach to Burmese Sentence Classification using Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06753
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06753
- Authors: Ye Kyaw Thu; Thura Aung; Thazin Myint Oo; Thepchai Supnithi
- Reference count: 7
- One-line primary result: KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves 91.23% accuracy (F1=0.9109) for hate speech detection, 92.66% accuracy (F1=0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82% accuracy (F1=0.9982) for language identification.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KAConvText, the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution for Text in sentence classification, addressing three tasks: imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification for Burmese. The method replaces standard CNN kernels with spline-parameterized functions, allowing dynamic learning of non-linear mappings from data. Experiments with various embedding configurations (random, static, and fine-tuned fastText embeddings with 100/300 dimensions) and classification heads (MLP and KAN) demonstrate that KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best performance: 91.23% accuracy (F1=0.9109) for hate speech detection, 92.66% accuracy (F1=0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82% accuracy (F1=0.9982) for language identification. KAConvText-KAN provides enhanced interpretability with nearly identical performance.

## Method Summary
KAConvText replaces standard 1D CNN kernels with spline-parameterized functions using cubic B-splines. The architecture consists of three convolutional layers with channels [64, 128, 256] and kernel sizes [3, 4, 5]. Each kernel element is a univariate non-linear function defined by B-splines and learnable gating parameters. The model supports two classification heads: MLP (softmax) and KAN (spline-based). Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, 10 epochs, and dropout 0.3. Experiments compare random, static, and fine-tuned fastText embeddings (100/300 dimensions, CBOW/Skip-gram) across three Burmese text classification tasks.

## Key Results
- KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves best performance: 91.23% accuracy (F1=0.9109) for hate speech detection, 92.66% accuracy (F1=0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82% accuracy (F1=0.9982) for language identification.
- Fine-tuned embeddings consistently outperform static and random embeddings across all tasks and embedding dimensions.
- KAConvText-KAN provides enhanced interpretability with nearly identical performance to KAConvText-MLP.
- 300-dimensional Skip-gram embeddings generally outperform CBOW and 100-dimensional variants.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Replacing fixed linear CNN kernels with learnable B-spline functions enables more expressive, data-adaptive feature extraction for text classification.
- **Mechanism:** Standard 1D CNNs compute features via fixed dot products followed by static activations (e.g., ReLU). KAConvText replaces each kernel element with a univariate B-spline function φ(x) = w_s·spline(x) + w_b·b(x), where the spline is a linear combination of B-spline basis functions and b(x) is a fixed basis (e.g., PReLU). This allows the convolution to learn non-linear input-to-output mappings directly from data, rather than being constrained by fixed activation shapes.
- **Core assumption:** Text classification benefits from flexible, learnable non-linearities at the kernel level, which can capture more nuanced patterns than fixed activations—especially for morphologically rich or low-resource languages like Burmese.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "The method replaces standard CNN kernels with spline-parameterized functions, allowing dynamic learning of non-linear mappings from data."
  - [section 3.3.3] Describes KAConvText's spline kernel as [φ_1, φ_2, ..., φ_K], with each φ_m a univariate non-linear function defined by B-splines and learnable gating parameters.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; related work focuses on KAN heads for classification, not convolutional spline kernels.
- **Break condition:** If the dataset is very small or highly noisy, the added flexibility of spline kernels could overfit or fail to converge, especially without regularization or sufficient training epochs.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Fine-tuning fastText embeddings jointly with KAConvText layers yields better performance than static or random embeddings, particularly for high-dimensional (300-dim) Skip-gram models.
- **Mechanism:** Pre-trained fastText embeddings provide subword-aware semantic priors. In the fine-tuned setting, these vectors are updated via backpropagation, adapting to task-specific context. When paired with KAConvText's spline-based convolution, the model can jointly adjust both the input representation and the non-linear feature extractor, leading to better alignment between embedding space and task-relevant features.
- **Core assumption:** The benefits of fine-tuned embeddings compound with more expressive architectures—spline kernels can exploit the richer, task-adapted embedding space more effectively than linear kernels.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best performance: 91.23% accuracy (F1=0.9109) for hate speech detection, 92.66% accuracy (F1=0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82% accuracy (F1=0.9982) for language identification."
  - [section 5.1] Shows F1 improvements from random → static → fine-tuned embeddings across tasks; highlights 300-dim fine-tuned Skip-gram as consistently best.
  - [corpus] Related papers on Arabic and Indonesian hate speech detection also report gains from fine-tuning pre-trained embeddings, supporting generalization of this mechanism.
- **Break condition:** If pre-trained embeddings are trained on corpora that are domain-mismatched or too small, fine-tuning may not help—or could degrade performance if overfitting occurs.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** KAConvText-KAN provides enhanced interpretability by using learnable spline functions in both convolution and classification, enabling visualization of how features are transformed.
- **Mechanism:** In KAConvText-KAN, both the convolutional kernels and the classification head are spline-based. Each univariate spline can be visualized as a function curve, showing how specific input ranges are mapped to outputs. This allows inspection of which feature values are amplified or suppressed, and how they contribute to class predictions—unlike standard CNNs with opaque linear weights and fixed activations.
- **Core assumption:** Interpretability is valuable for debugging, trust, and analysis in sensitive tasks (e.g., hate speech detection), and spline visualizations provide meaningful insight into model behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "KAConvText-KAN provides enhanced interpretability with nearly identical performance."
  - [section 3.3.4] Discusses visualizability of spline functions; Figure 2 shows B-spline surfaces evolving across epochs.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence on interpretability; related work focuses on performance, not visualization.
- **Break condition:** If spline functions become too complex (high grid size/order) or the task requires very deep networks, interpretability may diminish due to difficulty tracing interactions across many layers.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: B-spline basis functions**
  - Why needed here: KAConvText kernels are built from B-splines; understanding how they provide smooth, piecewise polynomial approximations is essential to grasp how learnable non-linearities work.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a cubic B-spline (order 3) provides a smoother and more flexible function approximation than a linear or quadratic spline?

- **Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART)**
  - Why needed here: KART underpins KANs and KAConvText, showing that multivariate functions can be decomposed into sums of univariate functions—this justifies replacing weight matrices with spline functions.
  - Quick check question: In your own words, how does KART enable KANs to approximate complex functions using only univariate spline transformations?

- **Concept: fastText embeddings (CBOW vs. Skip-gram)**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares CBOW and Skip-gram fastText embeddings at 100/300 dimensions; understanding their differences helps explain why Skip-gram often performs better for classification.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between CBOW and Skip-gram in how they predict context words, and why might Skip-gram be more suitable for rare or domain-specific terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Tokenized input → embedding lookup (fastText fine-tuned recommended) → 3 KAConvText layers with B-spline kernels → adaptive average pooling → MLP or KAN head → class prediction

- **Critical path:**
  1. Tokenized input → embedding lookup (fastText fine-tuned recommended)
  2. Embeddings passed through 3 KAConvText layers with B-spline kernels
  3. Feature maps pooled and flattened
  4. Passed through MLP or KAN head for class prediction

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Performance vs. interpretability: KAConvText-KAN offers interpretability but slightly lower F1 and higher compute time vs. KAConvText-MLP.
  - Embedding strategy: Fine-tuned fastText gives best results but requires more compute and data; static is faster but lower performance.
  - Spline complexity: Higher grid size/order increases expressiveness but also parameter count and training time.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Overfitting on small datasets: Spline kernels may memorize noise if regularization is insufficient.
  - Training instability: Early epochs may show large spikes in spline coefficients (see Figure 2, Epoch 1); should smooth by Epoch 10.
  - Ceiling effects: In very easy tasks (e.g., language identification), all models converge near 100% accuracy and differences become negligible.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline comparison: Train standard CNN vs. KAConvText-MLP on hate speech detection with random embeddings; expect CNN to be faster but KAConvText to achieve higher F1.
  2. Embedding ablation: Compare static vs. fine-tuned fastText (300-dim Skip-gram) with KAConvText-MLP on news classification; expect fine-tuned to outperform by ~1-2% F1.
  3. Interpretability check: Train KAConvText-KAN on hate speech detection, visualize spline surfaces at Epoch 1 vs. Epoch 10; expect early spikes to smooth out, showing convergence.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does KAConvText generalize effectively across different language families and typologies beyond Burmese, particularly for high-resource languages with established pre-trained models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "In the future, we plan to extend our evaluation across a broader range of languages and datasets to assess cross-linguistic and cross-domain generalizability, including low-resource settings."
- Why unresolved: All experiments were conducted exclusively on Burmese, a low-resource language with unique script and syllabic structure. The spline-based convolution's effectiveness for morphologically rich or agglutinative languages remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments on diverse languages (e.g., English, Arabic, Finnish, Chinese) showing consistent performance gains over standard CNNs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can KAConvText be effectively integrated with contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, LLM-derived features) to combine learned non-linear mappings with contextual representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We also intend to explore the integration of contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT or LLM-derived features) with KAConvText."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated static word embeddings (random, fastText). Contextual embeddings have different properties (dynamic, context-dependent) that may interact differently with spline-based kernels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing BERT/LLM embeddings with KAConvText versus standard architectures, measuring whether spline kernels add value to already contextualized representations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the claimed interpretability advantages of KAConvText-KAN be quantitatively validated through user studies or objective metrics beyond visualization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims "enhanced interpretability" and visualizes B-spline surfaces, but provides no quantitative evaluation of interpretability or human evaluation.
- Why unresolved: Interpretability claims rest solely on the ability to visualize learned spline functions. Without user studies or downstream task evaluation, practical interpretability benefits remain unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies where domain experts identify model behavior from visualizations, or metrics correlating spline patterns with linguistic features.

## Limitations

- **Dataset availability:** The paper does not provide direct access to the Burmese datasets used, citing only prior MT research papers. This creates a significant barrier to exact reproduction and validation of results.
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** While key parameters are specified, the impact of variations in batch size, learning rate scheduling, and spline grid initialization strategy are not explored. These could affect stability and performance, especially given the noted spline instability in early epochs.
- **Limited interpretability evidence:** While KAConvText-KAN is claimed to provide enhanced interpretability, the paper does not provide empirical analysis or user studies validating that spline visualizations meaningfully aid understanding or model debugging.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The core mechanism of replacing CNN kernels with learnable B-spline functions (Mechanism 1) is clearly described and theoretically grounded in KART. The superiority of fine-tuned embeddings (Mechanism 2) is well-supported by comparative results.
- **Medium confidence:** The interpretability benefits of KAConvText-KAN (Mechanism 3) are claimed but not empirically validated beyond visual inspection of spline surfaces. The claim that Spline kernels are universally superior is plausible but not conclusively proven across all dataset sizes and domains.
- **Medium confidence:** The reproducibility of the exact spline surface evolution and stability improvements is uncertain without access to the specific datasets and precise B-spline implementation details.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset accessibility verification:** Contact authors or trace cited MT papers to obtain the Burmese hate speech, news classification, and ethnic language identification datasets. Confirm segmentation standards (syllable vs. word) are correctly applied.

2. **Spline stability reproduction:** Implement KAConvText-MLP and train on a small Burmese text dataset (if available) with the specified hyperparameters. Monitor and visualize B-spline surfaces across epochs to confirm the reported smoothing from Epoch 1 to Epoch 10.

3. **Ablation study on embedding strategy:** Reproduce the embedding ablation (random → static → fine-tuned) on a common Burmese text classification benchmark. Measure not only accuracy/F1 but also training time and parameter count to quantify the cost-benefit tradeoff.
