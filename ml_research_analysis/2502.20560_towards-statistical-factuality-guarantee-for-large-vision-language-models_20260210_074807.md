# Towards Statistical Factuality Guarantee for Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20560
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20560
- Authors: Zhuohang Li; Chao Yan; Nicholas J. Jackson; Wendi Cui; Bo Li; Jiaxin Zhang; Bradley A. Malin
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CONF LVLM reduces hallucination errors from 87.8% to 10.0% on scene descriptions while maintaining 95.3% true positive rate

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where generated text contradicts visual content. The authors propose CONF LVLM, a framework that applies conformal prediction to achieve statistical guarantees on factuality. By treating LVLM-generated text as individual testable claims and using uncertainty measures to filter unreliable claims, the method provides rigorous guarantees on the accuracy of visual-linguistic responses across multiple domains including general scene understanding, medical radiology, and document understanding.

## Method Summary
CONF LVLM is a framework that applies conformal prediction to Large Vision-Language Models to provide statistical guarantees on factuality. The method treats each generated text segment as an individual claim that can be validated against visual content, then uses uncertainty measures to assess the reliability of these claims. Claims that fall below confidence thresholds are filtered out before the final response is returned. The framework is designed to be flexible, working with any LVLM and any uncertainty measure, while providing rigorous statistical guarantees on the accuracy of the filtered responses.

## Key Results
- Error rate reduction from 87.8% to 10.0% for LLaVA-1.5 on scene description tasks
- Maintained true positive rate of 95.3% after uncertainty filtering
- Demonstrated effectiveness across three domains: general scene understanding, medical radiology, and document understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging conformal prediction, a statistical technique that provides rigorous uncertainty quantification. By treating each generated claim independently and applying uncertainty thresholds, CONF LVLM can filter out unreliable statements before they reach the user. This approach transforms the problem of hallucination detection from an ad-hoc process to one with provable statistical guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

**Conformal prediction**: A statistical framework for uncertainty quantification that provides guaranteed coverage rates for predictions.
*Why needed*: Provides the theoretical foundation for achieving statistical guarantees on factuality.
*Quick check*: Verify that the calibration set is representative of the target distribution.

**Uncertainty measures**: Quantifiable metrics that assess the confidence of model predictions.
*Why needed*: Enables filtering of unreliable claims based on statistical confidence.
*Quick check*: Validate that uncertainty measures are well-calibrated across the input distribution.

**Claim validation**: The process of testing whether generated text is consistent with visual content.
*Why needed*: Forms the basis for identifying hallucinated content.
*Quick check*: Ensure validation metrics are robust to domain-specific variations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input images → LVLM → Claim generation → Uncertainty assessment → Confidence filtering → Final response

**Critical path**: The most time-sensitive operations are claim generation and uncertainty assessment, as these directly impact response latency.

**Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades potential completeness (by filtering claims) for increased accuracy and statistical guarantees. The choice of uncertainty measure affects both performance and computational overhead.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Over-filtering: Too many valid claims are rejected due to conservative thresholds
- Under-filtering: Unreliable claims pass through due to poorly calibrated uncertainty measures
- Calibration drift: Statistical guarantees break down when uncertainty measures become miscalibrated

**First experiments**:
1. Validate uncertainty measure calibration on held-out data
2. Test error reduction on a small, controlled dataset
3. Measure computational overhead and latency impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Generalizability across domains and tasks remains uncertain, as evaluation is limited to three specific domains
- Calibration stability of uncertainty measures across diverse inputs is not extensively validated
- Computational overhead and latency impact of the filtering step are not thoroughly analyzed
- Threshold selection sensitivity and its impact on statistical guarantees requires further investigation

## Confidence

- Statistical guarantees on factuality: High confidence - The conformal prediction approach is theoretically sound with demonstrated experimental results
- Framework flexibility: Medium confidence - While presented as applicable to any LVLM and uncertainty measure, validation is limited to specific combinations
- Generalizability across domains: Low confidence - Evaluation covers only three domains, with unproven performance on other visual content types

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain robustness test**: Evaluate CONF LVLM on additional domains beyond the three presented, including abstract visual reasoning tasks, to assess generalizability.

2. **Calibration analysis across diverse inputs**: Conduct extensive validation of uncertainty measure calibration across the full input distribution, including edge cases and adversarial examples, to verify stability of statistical guarantees.

3. **Real-world deployment analysis**: Measure computational overhead and latency impact in a real-time system, evaluating trade-offs between accuracy improvements and performance costs in practical applications.
