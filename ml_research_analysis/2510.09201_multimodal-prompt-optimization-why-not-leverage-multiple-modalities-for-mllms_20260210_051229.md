# Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces multimodal prompt optimization for MLLMs by extending search space beyond text-only prompts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): existing prompt optimization methods only search textual prompt spaces, ignoring the rich potential of non-textual prompts like images, videos, and molecular structures. The authors introduce MPO (Multimodal Prompt Optimization), a framework that jointly refines multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving exploration. MPO uses generation, edit, and mix operators combined with prior-inherited Bayesian UCB for efficient candidate selection. The method consistently outperforms text-only optimization approaches across 10 diverse datasets spanning images, videos, and molecules, achieving 6-8 percentage points accuracy gains while reducing evaluation budget by 42%.

## Method Summary
MPO extends traditional text-only prompt optimization by incorporating multimodal elements through three key operators: generation (creating new prompts from scratch), edit (modifying existing prompts), and mix (combining multiple prompts). The framework employs prior-inherited Bayesian UCB to efficiently select promising candidates while preserving alignment between prompts and model outputs. This approach addresses the limitation that MLLMs can process various modalities but are currently only optimized using textual prompts. By expanding the search space to include visual and structural prompts alongside text, MPO unlocks the full potential of MLLMs across diverse applications including image classification, video analysis, and molecular property prediction.

## Key Results
- Achieves average accuracy gains of 6-8 percentage points across 10 diverse datasets
- Reduces evaluation budget by 42% compared to text-only optimization methods
- Demonstrates strong generalizability across different base models, optimizer models, and modality-specific generators
- Shows consistent improvements in both image, video, and molecular property prediction tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of MPO stems from its alignment-preserving exploration strategy that maintains coherence between multimodal prompts and model responses. By using generation, edit, and mix operators, the framework can systematically explore the expanded multimodal prompt space while Bayesian UCB ensures efficient resource allocation. The prior inheritance mechanism allows the optimizer to leverage knowledge from previous optimization steps, preventing drift from promising regions of the search space. This approach is particularly effective because MLLMs inherently possess multimodal understanding capabilities, but these have remained underutilized in traditional text-only optimization approaches.

## Foundational Learning
**Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: Models that can process and generate multiple types of data (text, images, video, molecular structures). Why needed: Understanding MLLMs' inherent capabilities is crucial for developing optimization methods that leverage their full potential. Quick check: Verify the target model supports the specific modalities you intend to optimize.

**Bayesian Optimization**: A sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions. Why needed: Provides the mathematical foundation for efficient candidate selection in MPO. Quick check: Confirm the acquisition function (Bayesian UCB) properly balances exploration and exploitation.

**Alignment Preservation**: Techniques that maintain semantic consistency between prompts and outputs during optimization. Why needed: Prevents the optimizer from drifting into semantically incoherent regions. Quick check: Monitor alignment metrics throughout optimization runs.

**Prompt Engineering Operators**: Generation, edit, and mix operations for creating and modifying prompts. Why needed: These operators define how the search space is explored. Quick check: Validate each operator produces syntactically and semantically valid prompts for your target model.

**Cross-Modal Transfer**: The ability to apply knowledge from one modality to improve performance in another. Why needed: Enables more efficient optimization by leveraging correlations between modalities. Quick check: Test transfer learning scenarios between related tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Text Generator -> Visual Generator -> Mix Operator -> Edit Operator -> Bayesian UCB Selector -> MLLM -> Performance Evaluator -> Feedback Loop

**Critical Path**: The most computationally intensive path runs through the Bayesian UCB selector, which must evaluate multiple candidates across different modalities before selecting the optimal prompt for the MLLM.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades increased computational complexity (evaluating multimodal candidates) against improved performance and generalizability. The use of Bayesian UCB mitigates this by reducing the evaluation budget by 42%, but absolute computational costs remain unreported.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include semantic drift in prompts, modality-specific generation failures, and misalignment between prompt modifications and model outputs. These typically manifest as degraded performance on validation sets or generation of nonsensical multimodal prompts.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Run text-only optimization on a standard image classification dataset to establish baseline performance
2. **Single Modality Test**: Apply MPO using only visual prompts on the same dataset to isolate multimodal benefits
3. **Cross-Modal Validation**: Test the optimized prompts on a different but related task to evaluate generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to controlled benchmark settings; real-world performance on noisy or domain-specific data remains unverified
- Computational overhead characterization incomplete - absolute resource requirements not reported despite claimed budget reductions
- Limited testing on radically different MLLM architectures, though cross-model improvements were demonstrated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core technical contribution and ablation studies showing component importance
- **Medium Confidence**: Cross-model generalizability claims from testing across different base models
- **Medium Confidence**: Budget reduction claims based on comparative analysis without absolute cost reporting

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world deployment test**: Evaluate MPO on practical, non-benchmark datasets (e.g., medical imaging or industrial quality control) to verify generalizability beyond curated datasets
2. **Computational overhead analysis**: Measure wall-clock time and GPU memory usage for full MPO pipeline versus text-only optimization across different scale models (1B, 7B, 13B parameters)
3. **Robustness to noisy inputs**: Test MPO performance when visual prompts contain artifacts, compression artifacts, or domain shift to assess real-world reliability
