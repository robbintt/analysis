# Transfer-Prompting: Enhancing Cross-Task Adaptation in Large Language Models via Dual-Stage Prompts Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.14211
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14211
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces a two-stage prompt optimization framework for cross-task adaptation in LLMs

## Executive Summary
Transfer-Prompting introduces a novel dual-stage framework for optimizing prompts in large language models, addressing the challenge of adapting models to new tasks with limited data. The approach constructs generalized source prompts on related tasks before fine-tuning them for target-specific tasks, leveraging reference LLMs for prompt generation and scorer LLMs for multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in instruction-following rates, accuracy, and calibration across 25 models and 9 datasets, with particularly strong results in medical, legal, and financial domains.

## Method Summary
The Transfer-Prompting framework operates through two distinct stages: first, constructing generalized source prompts using related tasks, then fine-tuning these prompts for target-specific applications. The method employs a reference LLM to generate initial prompts and a scorer LLM to evaluate performance across multiple dimensions including accuracy, instruction-following, and calibration. This dual-stage optimization process allows for effective knowledge transfer between tasks while maintaining task-specific precision, resulting in improved model performance with minimal additional training data.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 20% improvement in instruction-following rates (IFR) compared to baseline methods
- Reduced expected calibration error (ECE) from 0.30 to 0.18 across tested models
- Demonstrated robust performance gains across medical, legal, and financial domains with 25 different models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-stage optimization leverages transfer learning principles by first establishing generalized prompt patterns from related tasks, then adapting these patterns to specific target domains. The reference LLM provides high-quality initial prompt templates, while the scorer LLM enables multi-dimensional evaluation that captures both task accuracy and instruction compliance. This approach effectively bridges the gap between task generalization and specialization, allowing models to maintain broad applicability while achieving domain-specific precision.

## Foundational Learning
- Prompt engineering fundamentals - Essential for understanding how text instructions shape LLM behavior and output quality
- Cross-task transfer learning - Critical for grasping how knowledge from related tasks can be leveraged to improve performance on new tasks
- Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics - Necessary for comprehensive assessment of model performance beyond simple accuracy measures

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Reference LLM -> Prompt Generator -> Scorer LLM -> Fine-tuning Module -> Target Task
- Critical path: Source prompt construction → Target task fine-tuning → Multi-dimensional evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Balance between generalization (source prompts) and specialization (target fine-tuning)
- Failure signatures: Degraded performance when source tasks poorly match target domain characteristics
- First experiments: 1) Evaluate IFR improvements on medical dataset 2) Test calibration improvements on financial tasks 3) Measure computational overhead vs baseline methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for complex real-world applications with larger datasets
- Potential computational overhead from reference and scorer LLM components
- Lack of comprehensive ablation study on relative contributions of optimization stages

## Confidence
- High confidence in core methodology effectiveness based on consistent improvements
- Medium confidence in generalizability beyond tested medical, legal, and financial domains
- Uncertainties remain about long-term stability and behavior under distribution shifts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive cross-domain testing beyond medical, legal, and financial domains to assess generalizability
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of source prompt construction versus target-specific fine-tuning
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability on larger, more diverse datasets for practical deployment considerations
