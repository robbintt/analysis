# On Transportability for Structural Causal Bandits

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17953
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17953
- Authors: Min Woo Park; Sanghack Lee
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 36-55% lower cumulative regret achieved by leveraging prior causal knowledge from source environments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the structural causal bandit with transportability framework, combining causal graphical models with transportability theory to improve learning efficiency in multi-armed bandit problems. The key innovation is identifying which prior information from heterogeneous source environments can be transferred to a target environment despite structural differences. The authors develop algorithms to compute bounds on expected rewards using arbitrary combinations of observational and experimental data, and propose a UCB-based algorithm that incorporates these bounds to guide exploration. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over standard bandit approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework models each environment as a structural causal model (SCM) with corresponding causal and selection diagrams. Given prior data from source environments, the method first identifies partially transportability patterns (PATR) using c-component analysis to determine which causal effects can be estimated in the target environment. It then computes bounds on expected rewards through a combination of PATR and causal bounds (CAUSALBOUND) algorithms. The method further incorporates dominance relationships among action spaces to prune suboptimal actions before exploration. A UCB-based algorithm (TRUCB) uses these bounds to guide exploration while maintaining theoretical guarantees on regret.

## Key Results
- 36-55% lower cumulative regret compared to standard UCB approaches
- Sub-linear regret bounds that explicitly depend on the informativeness of prior data
- Successful identification and exploitation of transportability patterns across heterogeneous environments
- Robust performance across three synthetic SCM tasks with varying structural differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the structure of causal relationships to identify which prior information can be transferred across environments. By decomposing the causal graph into c-components and analyzing selection diagrams, it determines which interventional distributions can be estimated in the target environment using data from source environments. The dominance relationships among action spaces allow for pruning of clearly suboptimal actions, reducing the exploration space. The combination of causal bounds and transportability patterns enables more informed decision-making than standard bandit approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal graphical models**: Directed acyclic graphs representing causal relationships; needed to formalize the problem structure and enable do-calculus operations
- **Transportability theory**: Framework for transferring causal knowledge across domains with distribution shifts; essential for leveraging prior data from source environments
- **C-component decomposition**: Partitioning variables into disjoint sets where variables are connected by bidirected edges; enables identification of transportability patterns
- **Do-calculus**: Rules for transforming expressions involving interventions into observational distributions; used to compute causal bounds
- **Multi-armed bandits**: Sequential decision-making framework; the base problem being enhanced with causal knowledge
- **UCB algorithms**: Upper confidence bound approach for balancing exploration and exploitation; forms the core of the proposed algorithm

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: SCM -> Causal Diagram -> Selection Diagram -> PATR -> Causal Bounds -> Dominance Bounds -> Action Space Pruning -> TRUCB Algorithm

**Critical path**: Input SCMs → C-component decomposition → PATR computation → Causal bounds (CAUSALBOUND) → Dominance bounds (UDB) → Action pruning → TRUCB exploration

**Design tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (multiple bound computations and c-component analysis) for improved sample efficiency. The pruning of dominated actions reduces exploration space but requires accurate dominance bound computation. The framework assumes access to prior data and causal structure knowledge.

**Failure signatures**: Incorrect c-component decomposition leading to wrong transportability patterns, dominance bounds exceeding valid probability ranges (1.0), failure to identify any transportability patterns resulting in baseline performance, or computational infeasibility for large action spaces.

**First experiments**: 
1. Validate c-component decomposition on simple SCM with known structure
2. Test PATR algorithm on synthetic selection diagrams with clear transportability patterns
3. Run TRUCB on a minimal 2-node SCM to verify basic functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- Requires access to prior data and causal structure knowledge from source environments
- Computational complexity scales with the size of action spaces and number of c-components
- Assumes the provided SCMs and selection diagrams accurately represent the environments
- Performance depends on the quality and relevance of prior data from source environments

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High
- Algorithmic correctness: High (explicit pseudocode provided)
- Empirical validation: Medium (no code repository, exact random seeds not provided)
- Reproducibility of exact results: Medium (implementation complexity and missing implementation details)

## Next Checks
1. Implement Task 1 SCM with binary variables and verify PATR correctly identifies transportability patterns using the provided c-component decomposition.
2. Run TRUCB on Task 1 (2-node system) for 1,000 trials to verify the algorithm produces sub-linear regret and correctly prunes dominated actions.
3. Validate that the dominance bounds computed by UDB (Alg. 3) correctly satisfy u_x ≥ ℓ_x for all actions in the pruned action space.
