# LLM-PS: Empowering Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Patterns and Semantics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.09656
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09656
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, consistently outperforming existing methods with MSE of 0.301 and MAE of 0.298 on average across multiple datasets

## Executive Summary
LLM-PS is a novel framework that enhances Large Language Models for time series forecasting by learning temporal patterns and semantics from time series data. It combines a Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) to capture short-term fluctuations and long-term trends with a Time-to-Text (T2T) module to extract meaningful semantics. The framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings. LLM-PS also shows robustness to noise and efficiency in training through the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

## Method Summary
LLM-PS integrates time series data with LLMs through two key modules: MSCNN for capturing multi-scale temporal patterns via wavelet-based decomposition, and T2T for extracting semantic features by reconstructing masked patches. The framework uses a pre-trained GPT-2 backbone (first 6 layers) with frozen weights and fine-tunes only LoRA adapters. The model employs a composite loss function that balances forecasting accuracy with semantic alignment. Input lengths are standardized (H=96 for long-term, 2×prediction horizon for short-term), and the framework is evaluated across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets
- Achieves MSE of 0.301 and MAE of 0.298 on average across benchmarks
- Demonstrates robustness to noise in time series data
- Shows efficiency in training through LoRA fine-tuning
- Performs well in both few- and zero-shot settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Scale Temporal Pattern Decoupling
If time-series data contains mixed short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, decomposing them via wavelet transforms in a multi-scale CNN improves feature representation compared to raw or pooled inputs. The MSCNN creates features with varying receptive fields using parallel branches, then decouples them into high-frequency (short-term) and low-frequency (long-term) components using Wavelet Transform. These are reassembled via local-to-global and global-to-local aggregation to reinforce patterns before LLM ingestion.

### Mechanism 2: Semantic Alignment via Masked Reconstruction
Treating time-series patches as semantic units (similar to words) and training a module to reconstruct masked patches bridges the modality gap between numerical data and text-pretrained LLMs. The T2T module masks 75% of input patches and learns by reconstructing these patches while predicting semantic labels derived from similarity to filtered text embeddings, enforcing the learning of semantic features rather than just statistical averages.

### Mechanism 3: Feature Transfer and Efficient Adaptation
Injecting pattern and semantic features into the LLM while fine-tuning only low-rank adapters (LoRA) preserves the LLM's generalization while specializing it for forecasting. The framework integrates features from MSCNN and T2T using a composite loss function that aligns the multi-scale features with T2T features, with the LLM backbone remaining frozen while only LoRA layers are updated.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Wavelet Transform (WT)**
  - Why needed here: Used in MSCNN to separate high-frequency (fluctuations) and low-frequency (trends) components from the CNN features
  - Quick check question: How does the Daubechies 4 (DB4) wavelet differ from a simple moving average in isolating trends?

- **Concept: Masked Autoencoders (MAE)**
  - Why needed here: The T2T module relies on a high masking ratio (75%) to force the model to learn latent semantic dependencies rather than local interpolation
  - Quick check question: Why does masking ~75% of patches typically force a model to learn higher-level semantics compared to masking 20%?

- **Concept: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses LoRA to fine-tune the GPT-2 backbone efficiently, avoiding the computational cost of full fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: In LoRA, how do the rank (r) and scaling factor (α) affect the balance between retaining pre-trained knowledge and adapting to new modalities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Layer -> MSCNN (Multi-Scale CNN with Wavelet Decoupling) -> T2T (Time-to-Text with Masking) -> LLM (GPT-2 with Frozen Backbone + LoRA) -> Output (Projection Layer)

- **Critical path:** The Feature Transfer step. The model relies on the successful fusion of F_MS (patterns) and F_T2T (semantics). If the dimensions or normalizations of these two feature streams do not match the LLM's input expectations, the frozen LLM cannot process them effectively.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Wavelet vs. Fourier: The paper argues wavelets are chosen to handle non-stationary time-series data better than Fourier transforms, trading off some computational simplicity for better time-frequency localization
  - Frozen vs. Full Fine-tuning: Freezing the LLM backbone ensures stability and efficiency but may limit the model's ability to deeply internalize time-series physics compared to full fine-tuning

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Mode Collapse in T2T: If T2T loss dominates, the forecast might match the semantic "text description" of a trend but fail numerically
  - Over-smoothing: If the "Global-to-Local" assembly in MSCNN is weighted too heavily, short-term fluctuations (high-frequency details) may be lost

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablate T2T: Run forecasting with "w/o T2T" (Table 5) to quantify the specific contribution of semantic features vs. temporal patterns alone
  2. Noise Robustness Check: Introduce Gaussian noise to verify if MSCNN/T2T filtering effectively denoises data compared to standard Transformers
  3. Decoupling Visualization: Visualize the output of the Wavelet Transform block to ensure the "Short-term" component actually captures noise/seasonality and "Long-term" captures the trend

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LLM-PS vary when applied to Large Language Model backbones other than GPT-2?
- Basis in paper: The paper explicitly restricts the experimental setup to the "pre-trained GPT2 model (the first six layers)" in Section 4, despite referencing other models like Llama in the introduction
- Why unresolved: The framework's compatibility and efficiency with decoder-only vs. encoder-only architectures or larger parameter scales remain untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark comparisons using the proposed MSCNN and T2T modules on alternative backbones like Llama or BERT

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the discrete semantic labeling in the T2T module limit the model's ability to capture nuanced time series dynamics compared to continuous representations?
- Basis in paper: The T2T module assigns semantic labels by projecting patches to the "most similar" text embedding from a filtered vocabulary (e.g., "Rise", "Drop") as described in Section 3.3 and Appendix B.4
- Why unresolved: Mapping continuous temporal patches to a fixed set of discrete text indices risks oversimplifying complex fluctuations that do not fit the predefined semantic categories
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the discrete T2T objective against a continuous feature alignment method

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the Daubechies 4 (DB4) wavelet transform optimal for decoupling temporal patterns across all time series domains?
- Basis in paper: The method specifically employs the DB4 wavelet for decomposition (Appendix B.1) without providing an ablation on the choice of wavelet basis
- Why unresolved: While DB4 is effective for smooth signals, it is unclear if it is superior to other bases (e.g., Haar, Morlet) for datasets with sharp discontinuities or varying stationarity
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of forecasting performance using different wavelet bases on the Traffic and ECG datasets

## Limitations

- Core Architecture Gaps: The paper does not fully specify how MSCNN and T2T features are fused into the LLM input stream, particularly the "Transferring Target Function" and "Learnable Forward" components
- Semantic Vocabulary Ambiguity: The complete list of keywords and exact indexing methodology for semantic labels are not provided
- Training Configuration Gaps: Key architectural parameters including the number of MSCNN blocks, number of branches, and channel dimensions are not explicitly specified

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- State-of-the-art performance on both short- and long-term forecasting tasks
- Robustness to noise as demonstrated in Figure 4c/4d
- Efficiency in training through LoRA fine-tuning

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Multi-Scale Temporal Pattern Decoupling effectiveness
- Semantic Alignment via Masked Reconstruction
- Feature Transfer and Efficient Adaptation

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Exact contribution of each component (cannot be determined without ablation studies on all architectural choices)
- Generalization to datasets not included in the benchmark

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study of Component Contributions:** Run the framework with "w/o T2T" as specified in Table 5 to quantify the specific contribution of semantic features versus temporal patterns alone

2. **Noise Robustness Validation:** Introduce controlled Gaussian noise to test datasets and verify if the MSCNN/T2T filtering effectively denoises data compared to standard Transformers

3. **Wavelet Decomposition Visualization:** Visualize the output of the Wavelet Transform block to ensure the "Short-term" component captures noise/seasonality and "Long-term" component captures the trend
