# Large-Scale Bayesian Tensor Reconstruction: An Approximate Message Passing Solution

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.16305
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16305
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: CP-GAMP reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to variational Bayesian method while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition algorithm designed for large-scale tensor reconstruction. The method leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid high-dimensional matrix inversions, enabling efficient inference in probabilistic tensor models. To automatically infer the tensor rank and noise power, the algorithm incorporates a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior with an expectation-maximization routine. Experiments on synthetic data show that CP-GAMP significantly reduces runtime while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.

## Method Summary
CP-GAMP implements Bayesian CP tensor decomposition using generalized approximate message passing to avoid costly matrix inversions. The algorithm employs a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior to enable automatic rank and noise power estimation through expectation-maximization. The method handles component-wise likelihood functions and processes large-scale tensors efficiently by avoiding explicit matrix operations. The algorithm iteratively updates factor matrices and estimates hyperparameters while maintaining computational efficiency through its GAMP-based framework.

## Key Results
- 82.7% runtime reduction on synthetic 100×100×100 tensors (rank 20, 20% observed) compared to variational Bayesian method
- 56.3% runtime reduction in image inpainting experiments
- 0.22 dB NMSE improvement in image inpainting tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CP-GAMP works by leveraging the computational efficiency of generalized approximate message passing, which avoids explicit matrix inversions that typically limit scalability in tensor decomposition algorithms. The Bernoulli-Gaussian prior enables automatic model selection by learning the tensor rank and noise parameters through expectation-maximization, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. The algorithm's ability to handle component-wise likelihood functions allows it to process large-scale tensors efficiently while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **GAMP framework**: Approximate message passing for Bayesian inference; needed to avoid matrix inversions in high-dimensional problems; quick check: verify convergence properties for tensor applications
- **CP decomposition**: Tensor factorization into rank-one components; needed to represent multi-dimensional data structure; quick check: validate reconstruction quality across different ranks
- **Bernoulli-Gaussian prior**: Sparsity-inducing prior for automatic rank selection; needed to enable model complexity learning; quick check: assess rank estimation accuracy
- **EM algorithm**: Expectation-maximization for hyperparameter learning; needed to automatically estimate noise power and rank; quick check: monitor convergence of parameter estimates
- **Component-wise likelihood**: Individual element processing in likelihood function; needed to maintain scalability; quick check: verify computational complexity scaling
- **Message passing**: Iterative belief propagation framework; needed to enable distributed inference; quick check: validate message update equations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Data -> GAMP processor -> Factor matrices -> EM updater -> Hyperparameters -> GAMP processor

**Critical path**: Observed tensor data → GAMP inference → Factor matrix updates → EM hyperparameter updates → Convergence check

**Design tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades off some theoretical guarantees for practical scalability by using GAMP instead of exact inference, while the EM-based hyperparameter learning introduces additional iterations but enables automatic model selection without manual tuning.

**Failure signatures**: Potential failure modes include non-convergence of the EM algorithm for rank estimation, poor reconstruction quality when the Bernoulli-Gaussian prior assumptions are violated, and numerical instability in the GAMP iterations for very sparse tensors.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Verify convergence behavior on synthetic tensors with known ground truth across different ranks (1-50)
2. Compare reconstruction accuracy against exact Bayesian methods on small tensors (10×10×10)
3. Test scalability on progressively larger tensors (50×50×50 to 500×500×500) to validate runtime claims

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization of runtime improvements to tensors with different ranks, dimensions, and missing data patterns remains uncertain
- Performance claims based primarily on comparison with a single state-of-the-art method (variational Bayesian)
- Assumptions of Gaussian noise and Bernoulli-Gaussian prior may not hold for all tensor reconstruction applications

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CP-GAMP's theoretical framework leveraging GAMP for tensor decomposition
- **Medium confidence**: Runtime improvement claims based on synthetic experiments
- **Medium confidence**: NMSE improvement claims from image inpainting experiments

## Next Checks
1. Test CP-GAMP on tensors with varying ranks (1-50) and dimensions (50×50×50 to 500×500×500) to verify scalability claims
2. Compare CP-GAMP performance against multiple tensor decomposition algorithms (not just variational Bayesian) across different noise distributions
3. Validate the EM-based rank estimation on real-world tensors with unknown ground truth ranks to assess practical utility
