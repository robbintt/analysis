# Exploratory Semantic Reliability Analysis of Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.22366
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22366
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** LLM-based framework extracts reliability insights from unstructured wind turbine maintenance logs, identifying failure modes and generating expert-level hypotheses.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an LLM-based exploratory framework for extracting reliability insights from unstructured wind turbine maintenance logs. The method moves beyond traditional classification to perform complex reasoning tasks like failure mode identification, causal chain inference, and comparative site analysis. By employing structured prompt engineering and zero-shot inference with GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, the framework acts as a "reliability co-pilot," transforming raw text into actionable operational intelligence. The approach was tested on a large industrial dataset, demonstrating its potential to uncover insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

## Method Summary
The framework uses zero-shot inference with large language models (specifically GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro) to perform exploratory semantic analysis on unstructured maintenance logs. It relies on structured prompt engineering, assigning roles like "Reliability Engineer" and enforcing specific output formats (JSON/Markdown). The method processes cleaned maintenance logs with fields including ID, Subsystem, Description, and Observations. The approach is designed to generate expert-level hypotheses rather than serve as a validated classification system, focusing on qualitative insights over quantitative accuracy.

## Key Results
- LLMs successfully identified 15 failure modes in power converter logs, with the top 8 accounting for 80% of events
- Framework generated structured outputs (JSON/Markdown) containing failure modes, counts, and supporting quotes
- Demonstrated capability for complex reasoning tasks including causal chain inference and comparative site analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' natural language understanding to extract semantic patterns from unstructured text that traditional classification methods miss. By using structured prompt engineering with role assignment and output formatting, it guides the LLM to produce expert-level reliability analysis. The zero-shot approach eliminates the need for labeled training data, making it adaptable to new domains. The combination of large context windows and reasoning capabilities allows the model to process extensive maintenance logs and identify complex failure patterns.

## Foundational Learning

**Zero-shot inference**
- *Why needed:* Eliminates dependency on labeled training data, enabling immediate application to new domains
- *Quick check:* Verify model produces coherent outputs without any fine-tuning on domain-specific data

**Structured prompt engineering**
- *Why needed:* Guides LLM reasoning toward specific reliability analysis tasks rather than general text generation
- *Quick check:* Confirm outputs follow required JSON/Markdown formats with all requested fields

**Role-based prompting**
- *Why needed:* Provides context and expertise framework for the LLM to emulate domain specialists
- *Quick check:* Review outputs for domain-appropriate terminology and analysis depth

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Raw logs -> Prompt engineering layer -> LLM inference -> Structured output generation -> Reliability insights

**Critical path:** The transformation from unstructured maintenance text to structured JSON containing failure modes and supporting evidence represents the core workflow. This requires careful prompt design to ensure the LLM extracts relevant patterns while maintaining traceability to source data.

**Design tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes exploratory insight generation over quantitative validation, accepting potential hallucination risks for the benefit of hypothesis generation. This makes it suitable as a co-pilot tool rather than a decision-making system.

**Failure signatures:** Primary risks include hallucinated failure modes not present in source data and context window limitations when processing large datasets. These manifest as fabricated insights or incomplete analysis of large log collections.

**First experiments:**
1. Process a small subset of logs (50-100 entries) to verify prompt effectiveness and output formatting
2. Compare LLM-generated failure modes against a manually labeled subset to assess qualitative accuracy
3. Test different role prompts to optimize the quality and relevance of generated insights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Absence of quantitative validation metrics makes it difficult to assess reliability or precision
- Proprietary dataset limits independent verification and reproducibility
- Potential for LLM bias in failure mode identification due to language patterns in the logs

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Methodological framing as exploratory tool is clearly articulated and internally consistent
- **Medium Confidence:** Qualitative results and real-world examples are persuasive but unverified
- **Low Confidence:** Lack of quantitative validation or error analysis prevents assessment of practical reliability

## Next Checks
1. **Quantitative Benchmarking:** Compare LLM-generated failure modes against a labeled subset of maintenance logs to measure precision, recall, and F1-score
2. **Bias and Robustness Analysis:** Test the framework on datasets from different wind farms or regions to identify potential biases or inconsistencies
3. **Hallucination Detection:** Implement a validation step to cross-check LLM outputs against the original log text, ensuring all identified failure modes are grounded in source data
