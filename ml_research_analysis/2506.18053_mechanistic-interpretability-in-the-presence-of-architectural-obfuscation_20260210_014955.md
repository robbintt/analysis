# Mechanistic Interpretability in the Presence of Architectural Obfuscation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.18053
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18053
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Architectural obfuscation significantly alters activation patterns within attention heads while preserving the overall computational graph, degrading fine-grained interpretability without compromising global task performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether architectural obfuscation—such as permuting hidden-state tensors or linearly transforming embeddings—impairs mechanistic interpretability of transformer models. The authors train a GPT-2-small model with obfuscation, then apply interpretability tools like logit-lens attribution, causal patching, and attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate internal circuits. They find that while obfuscation significantly alters activation patterns within attention heads, the overall layer-wise computational graph remains intact. This disconnect makes causal traces harder to align with baseline semantics and reduces interpretability precision, though the model's top-level task performance is preserved. In summary, obfuscation degrades fine-grained interpretability without compromising global behavior, offering privacy benefits but posing new challenges for interpretability research.

## Method Summary
The authors trained a GPT-2-small transformer model with architectural obfuscation techniques including tensor permutations and linear transformations of embeddings. They then applied standard mechanistic interpretability tools—logit-lens attribution, causal patching, and attention-head ablation—to analyze the model's internal circuits and compare them against a baseline GPT-2-small model without obfuscation. The evaluation focused on how well interpretability tools could locate and understand internal mechanisms despite the architectural modifications.

## Key Results
- Architectural obfuscation significantly alters activation patterns within attention heads while preserving overall layer-wise computational graph
- Interpretability precision is reduced due to misalignment between causal traces and baseline semantics
- Top-level task performance remains preserved despite obfuscation, while fine-grained interpretability becomes more difficult

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Architectural obfuscation works by transforming the internal representations of the model in ways that preserve the overall computational structure while making the individual components harder to interpret. When tensor permutations are applied, the attention heads process data in a different order, but the same information flows through the network. Linear transformations of embeddings preserve the subspace relationships while changing the basis, making it harder to map activations back to interpretable concepts. These transformations create a situation where the model's external behavior remains consistent with the baseline, but the internal "circuit diagram" becomes scrambled from an interpretability perspective.

## Foundational Learning
Why needed:
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understanding how neural networks compute internally through tools like attribution methods and causal analysis
- **Transformer Architecture**: Knowledge of attention mechanisms, residual connections, and layer-wise computation in transformers
- **Architectural Obfuscation**: Techniques for modifying model internals while preserving external behavior

Quick check:
- Can you explain how logit-lens attribution works?
- Do you understand the difference between attention pattern analysis and causal patching?
- Can you describe what happens during a tensor permutation in a transformer layer?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Embeddings -> Positional Encoding -> Multi-Head Attention -> Feed-Forward Network -> Layer Norm -> Output Projection

Critical path: Token embeddings flow through attention layers and feed-forward networks, with residual connections enabling gradient flow and layer normalization stabilizing training.

Design tradeoffs: The paper explores the tradeoff between model interpretability and architectural privacy, showing that obfuscation can protect internal mechanisms while maintaining task performance.

Failure signatures: When obfuscation is applied, attention patterns become harder to interpret, causal patching yields less precise results, and attribution methods produce noisier outputs that don't align with baseline semantics.

First experiments:
1. Apply logit-lens attribution to both obfuscated and baseline models to compare attention pattern similarity
2. Perform causal patching experiments to test circuit recovery accuracy
3. Conduct attention-head ablation to verify functional preservation across obfuscated layers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow architectural scope: Only GPT-2-small was evaluated, limiting generalizability to larger models
- Limited obfuscation techniques: Only simple tensor permutations and linear transforms were tested
- Qualitative interpretability assessment: Results lack quantitative metrics for precision degradation
- Unvalidated privacy claims: Privacy benefits discussed conceptually but not empirically tested against adversarial attempts

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Top-level task performance preserved under obfuscation | High |
| Obfuscation degrades fine-grained interpretability | Medium |
| Interpretability becomes harder due to misaligned causal traces | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Extend experiments to larger transformer variants (GPT-2-xl, BERT-large) and more aggressive obfuscation schemes including non-linear transforms
2. Develop quantitative metrics for interpretability precision degradation, including standardized comparison of attention pattern similarity and circuit mapping accuracy pre- and post-obfuscation
3. Design adversarial evaluation framework to empirically validate the claimed privacy benefits by testing whether standard interpretability tools can recover obfuscated circuits
