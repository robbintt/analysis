# Structured Semantics from Unstructured Notes: Language Model Approaches to EHR-Based Decision Support

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.06340
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06340
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Text-based features from clinical notes outperform structured EHR data in diagnostic classification and improve cross-institutional generalization

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to analyze unstructured clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to enhance clinical decision support. The approach leverages domain-specific language models like ClinicalBERT and Clinical ModernBERT to extract semantically rich features from free-text clinical narratives. By integrating medical codes (e.g., ICD) through explicit training on code descriptions, the method improves model interpretability and predictive performance. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA are employed to adapt models efficiently within clinical settings.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves preprocessing clinical notes from EHR datasets like MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, or eICU into 512-token chunks with 128-token stride windows. Domain-specific Transformers (ClinicalBERT or Clinical ModernBERT) generate contextual embeddings from these notes. Medical codes and their descriptions are integrated through joint embedding or contrastive learning approaches. The method employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) to adapt pre-trained models to specific clinical tasks, using PyTorch 2.1 with AdamW optimizer and mixed precision training. The resulting embeddings are pooled and used with downstream classifiers for various clinical prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Text-based features extracted via domain-specific Transformers outperform traditional structured EHR data in diagnostic classification tasks
- Models utilizing text-based features demonstrate better generalization capabilities across different institutions
- Explicitly integrating medical code descriptions with text further improves performance on code-related tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Text-based features extracted via Transformers yield higher predictive fidelity and generalization than structured EHR data alone.
- **Mechanism:** Domain-specific Transformers (e.g., ClinicalBERT, Clinical ModernBERT) utilize self-attention to generate contextual embeddings that capture nuanced clinical semantics (e.g., disease severity, temporal progression) often lost in sparse, structured billing codes.
- **Core assumption:** Critical patient state information is documented in unstructured narratives and is extractable via learned language representations.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Explicitly integrating medical code definitions (ICD/CPT) with text creates hybrid representations that outperform text-only models.
- **Mechanism:** By jointly training on the medical code and its textual description (e.g., "code: E11.9 description: Type 2 diabetes"), the model aligns symbolic ontologies with natural language in the latent space (via contrastive or joint embedding losses), grounding the text representation in standardized medical knowledge.
- **Core assumption:** General-purpose LLMs lack native understanding of medical codes, and aligning these codes with their semantic descriptions improves reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Text-derived features function as a "universal adapter" to harmonize data across different institutions.
- **Mechanism:** Documentation practices and structured data schemas (e.g., lab panels) vary widely between hospitals. Language models map these divergent inputs to a shared, high-dimensional semantic space, effectively normalizing the representation of "patient state" regardless of the source schema.
- **Core assumption:** The semantic drift in clinical language across institutions is lower than the structural drift in their EHR databases.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contextual Embeddings vs. Static Features**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper argues that structured features (one-hot codes) suffer from the curse of dimensionality, whereas contextual embeddings compress patient history into dense, semantically meaningful vectors.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the embedding for "cold" differ when processed by a Transformer in the context of "common cold" vs. "cold compress," compared to a static Word2Vec vector?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper emphasizes using LoRA to adapt large models (like Clinical ModernBERT) to specific clinical tasks without the prohibitive cost of full fine-tuning.
  - **Quick check question:** In the LoRA equation $h = W_0x + BAx$, which matrices are frozen and which are updated during backpropagation?

- **Concept: Domain Shift / Generalization**
  - **Why needed here:** A central claim is that text models generalize better across institutions. Understanding *why* generalization fails (e.g., covariate shift) is key to the paper's evaluation strategy.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is evaluating a model trained on MIMIC-III (Boston) on data from a geographically distinct hospital a stronger test of generalization than a random train/test split?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Clinical Notes -> Clinical ModernBERT/ClinicalBERT -> Joint Code Description Layer (Optional) -> [CLS] Pooling -> Linear Classifier/XGBoost

- **Critical path:**
  1. Preprocess notes (tokenization, chunking > 512 tokens)
  2. Generate embeddings using the Transformer encoder
  3. (Optional) Integrate code descriptions using contrastive/joint loss
  4. Pool output ([CLS] token or mean pooling) to get patient-level vector
  5. Downstream classification

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - ClinicalBERT vs. Clinical ModernBERT: ClinicalBERT limits context to 512 tokens (requires truncation/chunking of long patient histories); ModernBERT offers long-context support at potentially higher computational cost
  - Text vs. Hybrid: Text-only models offer better generalization/harmonization; Hybrid models (Text + Structured) may capture precise numerical trends (e.g., dropping lab values) better

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Overfitting to Hospital ID: Model learns to associate specific note styles with outcomes rather than clinical facts (fails generalization check)
  - Catastrophic Forgetting: Full fine-tuning destroys the pre-trained medical knowledge (mitigated by PEFT/LoRA)
  - Hallucinated Codes: Model predicts codes not supported by the text evidence (requires checking attention maps)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline Comparison: Train XGBoost on structured EHR vs. ClinicalBERT on notes. Compare AUC-ROC to verify if text outperforms structured baselines
  2. Cross-Institutional Validation: Train on Institution A data, test on Institution B data. Compare the performance drop of Text vs. Structured models to measure generalization
  3. Code Integration Ablation: Train Clinical ModernBERT with and without the explicit "code + description" supervision. Verify performance gain on code prediction tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can textual, structured, and imaging data be effectively fused into a unified latent space to create holistic patient representations?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.2 states that "the fusion of textual, structured, and imaging modalities into a unified latent space remains an open problem."
- Why unresolved: Current approaches often handle these modalities separately, failing to capture the complex interactions necessary for richer clinical insights.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a multimodal foundation model that outperforms single-modality baselines on diverse clinical prediction tasks while maintaining interpretability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific methods can enable large language models to provide reliable counterfactual reasoning and temporal tracing for clinical auditing?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.1 notes that "capabilities remain underdeveloped" for counterfactual reasoning and temporal tracing, which clinical users require.
- Why unresolved: Current post-hoc explanation techniques, such as attention visualization, are not reliable enough for high-stakes decision-making.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated model interface allowing clinicians to successfully audit specific decision pathways and trace predictions back to temporal events in the patient record.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic clinical text effectively address data scarcity and support model pretraining in low-resource domains?
- Basis in paper: Section 5.2 suggests that "synthetic data... offers a compelling pathway" but warrants further exploration regarding fidelity.
- Why unresolved: While promising for privacy, the realism and utility of synthetic text compared to real-world clinical narratives are unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results showing that models trained solely on synthetic data achieve performance parity with models trained on real clinical notes.

## Limitations

- All reported results are explicitly labeled as "hypothetical" in Section 4, meaning no actual empirical validation was conducted
- The approach assumes clinical notes are sufficiently high-quality and detailed to capture patient state, which may not hold in settings with templated or brief documentation
- Code integration assumes ICD/CPT descriptions are accurate and comprehensive, which may not always be true for complex or ambiguous clinical scenarios

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Text features outperform structured data):** Medium confidence - theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation
- **Mechanism 2 (Code integration improves performance):** Medium confidence - supported by related work but effectiveness depends on code description quality
- **Mechanism 3 (Text as universal adapter):** Low confidence - concept is plausible but lacks direct empirical support

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical performance validation:** Implement the proposed pipeline on MIMIC-III with a specific diagnostic classification task (e.g., sepsis detection or mortality prediction) and measure actual AUC-ROC, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.

2. **Cross-institutional generalization test:** Train the model on MIMIC-III data from one hospital site and test on eICU or external institutional data. Measure the performance drop between text-based and structured models to quantify the actual "universal adapter" effect.

3. **Code integration ablation study:** Conduct controlled experiments comparing Clinical ModernBERT performance with and without explicit medical code description integration on a code prediction task.
