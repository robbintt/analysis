# An approach of deep reinforcement learning for maximizing the net present value of stochastic projects

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12865
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies for stochastic project NPV maximization

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of stochastic projects where activity durations and cash flows are uncertain. The authors formulate project scheduling as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) that captures non-anticipativity constraints, enabling the agent to make decisions based only on information available at each decision point. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, DDQN demonstrates superior performance compared to rigid and dynamic scheduling strategies, particularly in environments with high uncertainty and large-scale projects.

## Method Summary
The approach formulates stochastic project scheduling as an MDP where the state includes current time, active/unfinished/finished activities, realized durations, and cash flow histories. A DDQN agent learns to maximize expected NPV by selecting activities to execute based on current information, with two separate networks preventing overestimation bias. The model uses experience replay and target network stabilization to ensure convergence, trained via standard reinforcement learning loops with ε-greedy exploration. The reward function is the discounted cash flow, with the discount factor β determining the preference for immediate versus future cash flows.

## Key Results
- DDQN outperforms rigid and dynamic scheduling strategies, particularly in large-scale and highly uncertain environments
- The dual-network architecture and target network substantially improve training convergence and robustness
- Ablation studies confirm that removing the target network leads to unstable convergence and high fluctuation
- DDQN achieves higher expected NPV compared to baseline methods on synthetic project datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Decoupled Action Selection and Evaluation
The DDQN architecture reduces overestimation of action values by using two separate neural networks. The Online Network selects the best action for the next state using current weights, while the Target Network evaluates that selected action using frozen weights. This prevents the "maximization bias" where a single network might select an action because it has an erroneously high value estimate.

### Mechanism 2: Target Network Stabilization
The Target Network parameters are copied from the Online Network only every C steps, creating a fixed ground truth for loss function calculations over many iterations. This allows the Online Network to converge toward a stable target rather than chasing a moving goal, preventing oscillation during training.

### Mechanism 3: State-Space Encapsulation of Uncertainty
The MDP state vector formulation allows the agent to satisfy non-anticipativity constraints while handling high-dimensional dependencies. By conditioning the policy only on information available at each decision point (not future random outcomes), the agent learns a reactive policy that maximizes expected NPV despite uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning

- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: The paper models stochastic project scheduling as a sequential decision process where current states determine future outcomes. Quick check: Can you define the tuple (S, A, p, r, β) in the context of this paper?
- **Temporal-Difference (TD) Error & Overestimation**: The core improvement of DDQN over DQN is addressing the bias in the TD target. Understanding δₖ = yₖ - Q(sₖ, aₖ; θ) is essential to grasp why the target network exists. Quick check: In standard DQN, why does taking the max of noisy Q-values lead to overoptimistic estimates?
- **Net Present Value (NPV) & Discounting**: The reward function is the discounted cash flow. The discount factor β determines how strongly the agent prioritizes immediate cash inflows over long-term uncertain ones. Quick check: How does the discount factor β influence the agent's decision to delay an activity with a negative cash flow?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Environment generates state sₖ → Online Network selects action aₖ via ε-greedy → Environment returns reward rₖ and next state sₖ₊₁ → Store tuple in Buffer → Sample batch → Compute Target: Online Net selects best action at sₖ₊₁, Target Net evaluates that action → Update: Gradient descent on MSE between Online Net's prediction and Target Net's evaluation
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Environment generates state sₖ
  2. Online Network selects action aₖ via ε-greedy
  3. Environment returns reward rₖ (discounted cash flow) and next state sₖ₊₁
  4. Store tuple in Buffer; Sample batch
  5. Compute Target: Online Net selects best action at sₖ₊₁; Target Net evaluates that action
  6. Update: Gradient descent on MSE between Online Net's prediction and Target Net's evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Dual-Network vs. Single trades computational overhead (two forward passes) for stability (mitigated overestimation); Rigid vs. Dynamic trades theoretical global optimality guarantee for scalability in high-dimensional spaces
- **Failure signatures**: Unstable Loss indicates Target Network update frequency C is too low; Conservative Policies suggest discount factor β or reward shaping penalizes risk too heavily
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Sanity Check (Small Scale): Replicate Example 1 (5 activities, 2 scenarios) to verify agent approximates theoretical optimal NPV
  2. Ablation (Stability): Run "No Target" variant on 30-activity instance to observe divergence/oscillation
  3. Scalability Test: Compare DDQN against "Rigid" and "Dynamic" policies on Ω₂ dataset (stochastic perturbations)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the inclusion of resource constraints impact the optimality and computational tractability of the DDQN-based scheduling policy? The current study assumes activities are limited only by precedence constraints, which is rarely the case in real-world projects where labor, equipment, and capital are finite. What evidence would resolve it: Extending the MDP state space to include resource availability levels and demonstrating convergence on standard Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
Can continuous-action reinforcement learning frameworks improve the stability and sample efficiency of the policy compared to the discrete DDQN approach? The current DDQN approach uses discrete action spaces, which may suffer from instability or inefficiency when fine-grained scheduling decisions are required. What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis measuring the convergence speed and reward stability of a continuous policy (e.g., PPO or DDPG) against the discrete DDQN on the same stochastic datasets.

### Open Question 3
How can advanced uncertainty modeling techniques be integrated to better handle ambiguity in activity durations and cash flows? While the current model handles stochasticity via discrete scenarios, it may not fully capture complex, continuous, or correlated uncertainties inherent in dynamic environments. What evidence would resolve it: Implementing probabilistic prediction layers or Bayesian neural networks within the DRL framework to quantify uncertainty bounds alongside scheduling decisions.

## Limitations

- The paper's experimental validation relies entirely on synthetic data with no real-world project datasets, limiting generalizability to actual project management contexts
- State vectorization methodology for variable-sized projects remains underspecified, particularly how sets of activities and histories are converted to fixed-size network inputs
- The comparison focuses on rigid and dynamic strategies but does not benchmark against other RL approaches or exact methods that could serve as stronger baselines for NPV maximization

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in DDQN mechanism claims regarding overestimation mitigation and target network stabilization, as these are well-established principles supported by both theoretical literature and ablation studies
- **Medium confidence** in the NPV-specific MDP formulation and its ability to capture essential trade-offs between accelerating inflows and deferring outflows, as the core MDP structure is sound but cash flow modeling assumptions are simplified
- **Low confidence** in absolute performance metrics and scalability claims without access to real project data or comparison against industry-standard project scheduling algorithms

## Next Checks

1. Apply the DDQN approach to a publicly available project scheduling dataset (e.g., PSPLIB) to test performance on realistic problem instances beyond synthetic generation
2. Compare against exact methods (e.g., stochastic dynamic programming) on small instances to verify DDQN's approximation quality, and against other RL variants (PPO, A3C) to confirm DDQN's superiority for this specific NPV objective
3. Systematically vary the discount factor β and reward scaling to identify sensitivity thresholds where policy behavior shifts from conservative to aggressive, and test on problems with non-uniform precedence structures
