# EHWGesture -- A dataset for multimodal understanding of clinical gestures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.07525
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07525
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Multimodal video dataset for clinical gesture understanding with over 1,100 recordings captured from 25 healthy subjects using RGB-Depth and event cameras

## Executive Summary
EHWGesture is a novel multimodal video dataset designed for understanding clinical gestures, featuring five common hand dexterity assessment gestures. The dataset comprises over 1,100 recordings totaling approximately 6 hours of synchronized data captured from 25 healthy subjects using RGB, Depth, and event cameras alongside motion capture ground truth. The authors introduce execution speed classes for action quality assessment, mirroring clinical evaluation methods. Baseline experiments demonstrate the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger detection, and action quality assessment tasks, with multimodal fusion consistently improving performance across all tasks.

## Method Summary
The EHWGesture dataset was collected using synchronized RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera to capture five common clinical gestures used in hand dexterity assessments. Data was gathered from 25 healthy subjects performing these gestures, with precise ground-truth tracking provided by a motion capture system. The dataset includes execution speed annotations to enable action quality assessment, reflecting how clinicians evaluate patient performance. The authors developed baseline models for three tasks: gesture classification, gesture trigger detection, and action quality assessment, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal fusion approaches that combine information from all three sensor modalities.

## Key Results
- Gesture classification achieves approximately 91% average accuracy using multimodal fusion
- Gesture trigger detection reaches 97-98% accuracy with combined modalities
- Multimodal fusion consistently improves performance across all tasks, with highest gains when combining all three modalities (RGB, Depth, and event)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive multimodal approach, capturing gestures from multiple sensor perspectives simultaneously. The inclusion of ground-truth motion capture data provides precise tracking information that enables accurate model training and evaluation. By incorporating execution speed classes, the dataset mirrors real clinical assessment practices where the quality and speed of movement are crucial diagnostic indicators. The combination of different sensing modalities (RGB, depth, and event cameras) captures complementary information about gesture execution, allowing models to leverage visual appearance, 3D structure, and temporal dynamics for improved understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal data fusion: Combining information from multiple sensor types to improve understanding and performance
  *Why needed:* Different sensors capture complementary aspects of gestures that single modalities might miss
  *Quick check:* Verify that combining modalities consistently improves baseline performance metrics

- Action quality assessment: Evaluating the execution quality of gestures based on speed and precision
  *Why needed:* Clinical assessments often focus on movement quality rather than just gesture completion
  *Quick check:* Confirm that speed-based classification aligns with clinical evaluation standards

- Event camera advantages: Capturing asynchronous changes in brightness for improved temporal resolution
  *Why needed:* Traditional frame-based cameras may miss rapid gesture transitions
  *Quick check:* Compare event camera performance against RGB-only approaches for fast movements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** RGB camera -> Feature extraction -> Fusion layer -> Classification/Detection/Quality Assessment
                    Depth camera -> Feature extraction -> Fusion layer
                    Event camera -> Feature extraction -> Fusion layer
                    Motion capture -> Ground truth generation

**Critical path:** Data capture -> Preprocessing -> Multimodal feature extraction -> Fusion -> Task-specific output

**Design tradeoffs:** The authors chose to collect data from healthy subjects only, limiting clinical applicability but ensuring clean data for baseline development. They prioritized synchronized multimodal capture over larger subject diversity, resulting in rich data per subject but fewer total participants.

**Failure signatures:** Performance degradation when tested on pathological cases, overfitting to the limited set of five gestures, and reduced accuracy when any single modality is missing from the input stream.

**First experiments:**
1. Train and evaluate gesture classification models using each modality independently to establish baseline performance
2. Implement early fusion of RGB and depth features to assess the impact of 3D spatial information
3. Add event camera data to the multimodal pipeline and measure improvements in gesture trigger detection accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research, focusing instead on presenting the dataset and baseline results.

## Limitations
- Dataset collected only from healthy subjects, limiting generalizability to clinical populations with hand dexterity impairments
- Limited to five specific gestures from one clinical assessment battery, constraining broader applicability
- Dataset size of ~1,100 recordings may be insufficient for robust deep learning model training

## Confidence

**Major claim confidence labels:**
- Dataset construction and methodology: High - Well-documented data collection with synchronized modalities and ground-truth tracking
- Baseline performance metrics: Medium - Results show reasonable performance but may be inflated due to limited subject diversity and gesture variety
- Multimodal fusion benefits: Medium - Consistent improvements shown, but optimal modality combinations remain unclear without extensive ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. Test baseline models on a held-out subset of the dataset to verify reported performance metrics are reproducible and not overfitted to the training splits
2. Evaluate model performance when trained on healthy subjects but tested on recordings of individuals with actual hand dexterity impairments
3. Conduct a thorough ablation study comparing all possible modality combinations (RGB-only, depth-only, event-only, RGB+depth, RGB+event, depth+event, all three) to identify the most effective fusion strategy for each task
