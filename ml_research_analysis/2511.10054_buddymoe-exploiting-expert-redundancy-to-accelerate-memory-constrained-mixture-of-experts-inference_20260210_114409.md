# BuddyMoE: Exploiting Expert Redundancy to Accelerate Memory-Constrained Mixture-of-Experts Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.10054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10054
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Achieves up to 10% throughput improvement with negligible accuracy loss in memory-constrained MoE inference

## Executive Summary
BuddyMoE addresses the challenge of memory-constrained inference in Mixture-of-Experts models by exploiting expert redundancy. The system identifies functionally similar "buddy experts" through offline analysis of co-activation patterns and output similarity. During inference, when prefetching fails to load an expert from CPU memory, BuddyMoE dynamically substitutes a cached buddy expert already resident in GPU memory, trading minimal accuracy loss for substantial throughput gains.

The approach uses three key metrics—Token Activating Entropy, Expert Distribution Gate, and Buddy Selection Priority Score—to balance accuracy preservation with latency reduction. Experiments demonstrate that BuddyMoE can significantly improve inference performance, particularly under severe memory constraints where conventional approaches fail entirely, making it a promising solution for deploying large MoE models on resource-limited hardware.

## Method Summary
BuddyMoE leverages expert redundancy in MoE models to mitigate latency during memory-constrained inference. The system performs offline analysis to identify "buddy experts" that are functionally similar based on co-activation patterns and output similarity metrics. During runtime, when an expert cannot be loaded into GPU memory due to constraints, BuddyMoE substitutes a cached buddy expert that is already resident in memory. This substitution strategy uses three key metrics—Token Activating Entropy, Expert Distribution Gate, and Buddy Selection Priority Score—to ensure that accuracy degradation remains minimal while maximizing throughput improvements. The approach is particularly effective when memory resources are severely limited.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 10% throughput improvement during MoE inference
- Demonstrates negligible accuracy loss when substituting buddy experts
- Shows effectiveness particularly under severe memory constraints where conventional approaches fail
- Works with state-of-the-art MoE models without requiring architectural modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BuddyMoE exploits the inherent redundancy that often exists among experts in large MoE models. Many experts learn similar representations and respond similarly to similar inputs, making them functionally interchangeable in many cases. By identifying these redundant experts through offline analysis and caching the most useful ones in GPU memory, the system can substitute them when the ideal expert is unavailable due to memory constraints. The three metrics ensure that substitutions are made intelligently, prioritizing experts that are most likely to maintain accuracy while maximizing the benefit of reduced memory transfers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Expert Redundancy in MoE Models**: The observation that different experts often learn similar representations and respond similarly to similar inputs. Why needed: Forms the theoretical basis for buddy expert substitution. Quick check: Compare activation patterns and outputs of different experts on the same inputs.
- **Co-activation Pattern Analysis**: Examining when different experts are activated together across many inference samples. Why needed: Helps identify experts that serve similar functions. Quick check: Calculate correlation coefficients between expert activation frequencies.
- **Output Similarity Metrics**: Methods for quantifying how similar the outputs of different experts are. Why needed: Provides objective measures for determining expert functional similarity. Quick check: Compute cosine similarity between expert output distributions.
- **Token Activating Entropy**: Measures the diversity of expert activations across different tokens. Why needed: Helps identify which experts are more critical vs. redundant. Quick check: Calculate entropy of expert activation distributions per token.
- **Expert Distribution Gate**: Analyzes the distribution of gating decisions across the model's inputs. Why needed: Reveals which experts are frequently activated together. Quick check: Plot co-occurrence matrices of expert activations.
- **Buddy Selection Priority Score**: A composite metric that ranks potential buddy expert pairs based on redundancy and importance. Why needed: Enables intelligent selection of substitution candidates. Quick check: Validate that high-priority buddy pairs maintain accuracy when substituted.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Offline Analysis Module -> Buddy Expert Database -> Runtime Substitution Engine -> MoE Inference System

**Critical Path:**
Input token → Gating network → Expert selection → Memory availability check → (If unavailable) Buddy expert substitution → Forward pass → Output aggregation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. throughput: More aggressive substitution increases throughput but risks higher accuracy loss
- Offline computation time vs. runtime performance: More thorough offline analysis improves substitution quality but requires more preprocessing
- Memory overhead for buddy database vs. performance gain: Storing comprehensive buddy information requires additional memory but enables better substitutions

**Failure Signatures:**
- Accuracy degradation exceeding acceptable thresholds
- Suboptimal substitutions when high-quality buddy experts are unavailable
- Overhead from maintaining buddy expert database outweighing performance benefits
- Ineffective buddy identification when expert redundancy is minimal

**3 First Experiments:**
1. **Buddy Quality Validation**: Evaluate the accuracy of buddy expert substitutions across different MoE models and tasks to establish baseline performance
2. **Memory Constraint Simulation**: Test BuddyMoE under varying memory constraints to identify the point where benefits begin to diminish
3. **Comparison with Baseline**: Compare throughput and accuracy against standard MoE inference with and without expert caching

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on the assumption that expert redundancy exists and can be reliably identified through offline analysis
- Effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the three key metrics for identifying functional relationships
- May not work well for MoE architectures with highly specialized experts or domain-specific requirements
- Limited analysis of performance across different types of MoE models (sparse vs dense gating, different routing strategies)

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The general concept of exploiting expert redundancy is theoretically sound and aligns with established MoE research
- **Medium confidence**: The reported throughput improvements are plausible given the methodology, but lack rigorous statistical validation
- **Low confidence**: The claims about "negligible accuracy loss" are not sufficiently substantiated with quantitative evidence

## Next Checks
1. **Statistical Validation**: Conduct statistical significance testing on throughput improvements across multiple runs and different hardware configurations, reporting confidence intervals and p-values to substantiate the 10% improvement claim.

2. **Accuracy Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically evaluate accuracy degradation across different task types and MoE architectures when using buddy expert substitution, establishing quantitative thresholds for what constitutes "negligible" accuracy loss.

3. **Generalizability Testing**: Test BuddyMoE's effectiveness on MoE models with varying degrees of expert specialization and different routing mechanisms to determine the approach's limitations when expert redundancy assumptions break down.
