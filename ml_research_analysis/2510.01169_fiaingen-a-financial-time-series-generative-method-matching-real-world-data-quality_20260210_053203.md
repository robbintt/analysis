# Fiaingen: A financial time series generative method matching real-world data quality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.01169
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01169
- Reference count: 21
- Introduces graph-based synthetic financial time series generation with superior runtime efficiency

## Executive Summary
Fiaingen presents a novel approach to synthetic financial time series generation using graph-based methods. The system transforms time series data into visibility graphs and employs random walks to generate synthetic sequences, achieving strong performance metrics while maintaining computational efficiency. The method demonstrates particular advantages over deep generative models in terms of runtime, generating data in seconds rather than hours or days.

## Method Summary
Fiaingen transforms financial time series into visibility graphs (natural, horizontal, and multigraph variants) and uses random walks to generate synthetic sequences. The approach was evaluated on 160-255 stock tickers from the financial sector, comparing performance against established generative models including TimeGAN, cGAN, STS, and DiffusionTS. The system preserves structural and temporal properties of the original data while offering significant computational advantages.

## Key Results
- Achieved ROC AUC scores up to 0.85 on classification tasks
- Generated synthetic data in seconds versus hours/days for deep generative models
- Demonstrated strong overlap with real data in t-SNE visualizations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The graph-based transformation allows capturing complex temporal dependencies and structural patterns in financial time series. By converting time series to visibility graphs, Fiaingen can leverage well-established graph algorithms for synthetic data generation. The random walk approach on these graphs naturally preserves temporal relationships while generating novel sequences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Visibility Graphs**: Transform time series into graph structures where nodes represent time points and edges indicate visibility relationships
  - Why needed: Captures temporal dependencies in a form amenable to graph algorithms
  - Quick check: Verify that original time series patterns are preserved in the graph representation
- **Random Walks on Graphs**: Stochastic traversal of graph structures to generate new sequences
  - Why needed: Provides a natural mechanism for generating synthetic time series while preserving structural properties
  - Quick check: Ensure generated sequences maintain statistical properties of the original data
- **Graph Variants (Natural, Horizontal, Multigraph)**: Different approaches to converting time series to graphs
  - Why needed: Offers flexibility in capturing different aspects of time series behavior
  - Quick check: Compare performance across different graph variants for specific use cases

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Raw Time Series -> Visibility Graph Conversion -> Random Walk Generation -> Synthetic Time Series

Critical Path:
Time series data flows through visibility graph conversion, where structural relationships are encoded. Random walks on the resulting graph generate synthetic sequences that preserve temporal and structural properties.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational efficiency vs. model complexity: Graph-based methods vs. deep learning approaches
- Data fidelity vs. generation speed: Random walks provide fast generation but may have limitations in capturing very complex patterns
- Interpretability vs. performance: Graph-based methods offer better interpretability than black-box deep learning models

Failure Signatures:
- Synthetic data failing statistical tests for distributional similarity
- Generated sequences lacking realistic temporal patterns or exhibiting unrealistic artifacts
- Poor performance on downstream tasks despite good visual similarity

First Experiments:
1. Generate synthetic data using each visibility graph variant and compare basic statistical properties
2. Evaluate synthetic data performance on simple classification tasks vs. real data
3. Compare generation times across different dataset sizes and graph variants

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification tasks and t-SNE visualizations, potentially missing other important aspects of data quality
- Claims of "strong overlap" with real data lack quantitative distributional similarity metrics beyond ROC AUC
- Runtime comparisons don't account for potential trade-offs in data fidelity or downstream task performance
- Limited to financial sector stock tickers, raising questions about generalizability to other domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in computational efficiency claims and ROC AUC results
- Medium confidence in t-SNE visualization overlap claims
- Medium confidence in overall data quality preservation
- Low confidence in generalizability beyond financial sector stock data

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive distributional similarity tests (e.g., KS test, Wasserstein distance) to quantify synthetic-real data overlap beyond visual inspection
2. Evaluate synthetic data utility on additional downstream tasks beyond classification, such as regression or clustering
3. Test Fiaingen on non-financial datasets to assess generalizability and robustness across domains
