# CS3-Bench: Evaluating and Enhancing Speech-to-Speech LLMs for Mandarin-English Code-Switching

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.07881
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07881
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Introduces first Mandarin-English speech-to-speech code-switching benchmark; existing models show up to 66% performance drop on knowledge QA tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CS3-Bench, the first code-switching speech-to-speech benchmark for Mandarin-English interactions. The authors systematically evaluate existing speech-to-speech models and find substantial performance degradation (up to 66% accuracy drop) when handling code-switched input, particularly in knowledge-intensive question answering tasks. To address these limitations, they propose a multi-faceted approach including Chain of Recognition (CoR) for improved English content recognition and Keyword Highlighting (KH) for better mixed-language response generation. The methods demonstrate significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, increasing knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13% and improving open-ended understanding from 64.5% to 86.5%.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a code-switching dataset using speech synthesis and translation techniques to create synthetic Mandarin-English code-switched speech. They introduce Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance English content recognition within mixed-language queries by implementing a recognition chain that better handles code-switching boundaries. The Keyword Highlighting (KH) method guides the generation of mixed-language responses by emphasizing key terms in both languages. These methods are integrated with existing speech-to-speech models to create an enhanced system that better handles the linguistic complexity of code-switching scenarios. The benchmark evaluates performance across knowledge-intensive QA and open-ended conversation tasks.

## Key Results
- Knowledge accuracy improved from 25.14% to 46.13% using proposed methods
- Open-ended understanding increased from 64.5% to 86.5% 
- Pronunciation errors in secondary language speech were reduced
- Existing models show up to 66% performance drop on knowledge QA with code-switched input

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed methods address fundamental challenges in code-switching speech processing by improving both recognition and generation phases. Chain of Recognition enhances the model's ability to correctly identify and process English content within Mandarin-dominant utterances by implementing specialized recognition strategies for code-switching boundaries. Keyword Highlighting guides the generation model to maintain linguistic consistency and emphasize important terms in both languages, reducing the tendency to default to a single language. Together, these approaches mitigate the performance degradation observed in existing models by providing explicit handling of the linguistic complexity inherent in code-switching scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

**Code-switching**: The alternating use of two or more languages within a single conversation or utterance. Needed because understanding and generating code-switched speech requires handling multiple linguistic systems simultaneously. Quick check: Identify code-switching patterns in mixed-language speech samples.

**Speech-to-speech translation**: Direct conversion of spoken input in one language to spoken output in another language, bypassing text representation. Needed because it enables real-time multilingual communication. Quick check: Trace the pipeline from speech input to speech output in a speech-to-speech system.

**Speech synthesis**: Generation of artificial speech from text or other linguistic representations. Needed because it produces the evaluation data and target speech outputs for the benchmark. Quick check: Compare natural and synthesized speech for linguistic features.

**Benchmark construction**: Systematic creation of standardized evaluation datasets and metrics. Needed because it enables fair comparison across different speech-to-speech models and approaches. Quick check: Verify benchmark coverage across different code-switching scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Speech Input -> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) -> Translation/Understanding -> Generation -> TTS (Text-to-Speech) -> Speech Output

**Critical path**: The recognition and generation components are most critical for code-switching performance. Chain of Recognition improves the ASR stage's handling of mixed-language input, while Keyword Highlighting enhances the generation stage's ability to produce coherent mixed-language output.

**Design tradeoffs**: The authors balance between synthetic data realism and practical dataset construction. While synthetic data enables controlled evaluation, it may not fully capture natural code-switching variability. The methods trade some generation fluency for improved code-switching accuracy.

**Failure signatures**: Common failures include complete language misinterpretation, loss of semantic content during code-switching, and generation of monolingual responses when mixed-language output is expected. The benchmark identifies these through specific evaluation metrics for accuracy and understanding.

**First experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline speech-to-speech models on CS3-Bench to establish performance baselines
2. Test Chain of Recognition component in isolation to measure recognition accuracy improvements
3. Evaluate Keyword Highlighting's impact on generation quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The synthetic nature of evaluation data may not fully capture real-world code-switching variability
- Benchmark relies on single speakers for each language, limiting generalizability to diverse speaker populations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on two specific domains, leaving uncertainty about performance in other conversational contexts

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Benchmark construction methodology and measured performance gaps are systematically validated; knowledge accuracy and understanding metrics show substantial, measurable improvements.

**Medium confidence**: Method effectiveness given synthetic data constraints; generalizability to real-world spontaneous code-switching scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the benchmark and proposed methods on naturally recorded Mandarin-English code-switching speech data from diverse speakers to assess real-world robustness

2. Test the Chain of Recognition and Keyword Highlighting approaches across additional language pairs and code-switching directions (e.g., English-Mandarin, Spanish-English)

3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of CoR and KH components and determine optimal integration strategies with different speech-to-speech model architectures
