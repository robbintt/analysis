# A Physics Informed Machine Learning Framework for Optimal Sensor Placement and Parameter Estimation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.15543
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15543
- **Reference count:** 7
- **Primary result:** PINN-based framework for joint optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation in distributed-parameter systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with optimal experimental design for sensor placement and parameter estimation in distributed-parameter systems. The method leverages automatic differentiation within PINNs to compute sensitivity functions, which are then used to select sensor locations based on D-optimality criteria. The approach is demonstrated on both 1D steady-state and 2D transient reaction-diffusion-advection problems, showing significant improvements in parameter estimation accuracy compared to intuitive or random sensor placements. The framework is mesh-free and adaptable to complex geometries, offering a promising alternative to traditional discretization-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a PINN model with unknown parameters as inputs to compute sensitivity functions via automatic differentiation. These sensitivity functions are then used to select sensor locations under the D-optimality criterion, which maximizes the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The approach involves training two PINNs: one for sensitivity analysis and another for parameter estimation. The method is validated on a 1D steady-state and a 2D transient reaction-diffusion-advection problem, demonstrating improved parameter estimation accuracy with optimal sensor placement. The framework also supports transfer learning for efficient retraining under changing conditions.

## Key Results
- Optimal sensor placement consistently improves parameter estimation accuracy compared to intuitive or random placements, even in the presence of measurement noise
- In the 1D case, optimal sensor placement reduced error from 84.7% to 0.20% compared to suboptimal choices
- In the 2D case, up to five sensors were tested, with optimal placement improving accuracy for both Péclet and Damköhler number estimates
- The approach is mesh-free, adaptable to complex geometries, and supports transfer learning for efficient retraining under changing conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the differentiability of physics-informed neural networks to compute sensitivity functions, which quantify how changes in parameters affect the system's output. By maximizing the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), the method ensures that the selected sensor locations provide the most informative data for parameter estimation. The use of D-optimality criteria ensures that the selected sensor locations minimize the uncertainty in parameter estimates, leading to improved accuracy. The mesh-free nature of the approach allows for adaptability to complex geometries, while transfer learning enables efficient retraining under changing conditions.

## Foundational Learning

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

- **Quick check:** Confirm that sensitivity functions capture parameter influence accurately

### Optimal Experimental Design (D-optimality)
- **Why needed:** To select sensor locations that maximize information content for parameter estimation
- **Quick check:** Verify that FIM determinant is maximized at chosen sensor locations

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
PINN -> Sensitivity Functions -> Fisher Information Matrix -> Sensor Placement Optimization

### Critical Path
1. Train PINN with parameters as inputs
2. Compute sensitivity functions via automatic differentiation
3. Calculate Fisher Information Matrix
4. Optimize sensor placement using D-optimality criterion
5. Train inference PINN for parameter estimation

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Mesh-free vs discretization:** Flexibility in complex geometries vs potential accuracy issues
- **Computational cost vs accuracy:** More sensors improve accuracy but increase computational burden
- **Prior knowledge vs data-driven:** Reliance on physics models vs adaptability to data

### Failure Signatures
- Poor parameter estimation accuracy despite optimal sensor placement
- Sensitivity functions that do not capture parameter influence accurately
- Computational cost that scales poorly with parameter count

### First 3 Experiments
1. Validate sensitivity function computation on a simple 1D system with known parameters
2. Test sensor placement optimization on a 2D system with varying parameter counts
3. Evaluate transfer learning effectiveness for parameter estimation under changing conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Under what conditions does the assumption that sensitivity function maxima locations remain approximately invariant when evaluated at prior versus true parameter values break down?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state "Here we assume that their qualitative structure (e.g., locations of maxima) remains the same when evaluated at λ_prior compared to the true λ. When the computed optima differ substantially, we use an iterative approach."
- **Why unresolved:** Only brief validation is provided showing the 1D maximum shifted from x*=1.81 to x*=2.32 when recomputed with true parameters, but no systematic analysis of when this approximation fails for more complex systems or larger parameter deviations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A sensitivity analysis across varying prior-to-true parameter ratios in systems with different nonlinearity characteristics, quantifying error in sensor placement as a function of prior accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the framework's performance scale with the number of unknown parameters, particularly when parameters exhibit strong correlation?
- **Basis in paper:** The paper only demonstrates 1D single-parameter and 2D two-parameter estimation. The FIM determinant computation and optimization complexity grow combinatorially with parameter count, and highly correlated parameters may yield degenerate FIM with limited D-optimality discriminative power.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking on systems with 5+ unknown parameters, analyzing FIM condition numbers and parameter estimation accuracy as dimensionality increases.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can the computationally intensive sensitivity PINN training (≈270 minutes for the 2D case) be reduced through transfer learning or surrogate-based approaches without sacrificing sensor placement quality?
- **Basis in paper:** "Training a PINN to compute sensitivity functions is computationally intensive at the outset (≈ 270 minutes), owing to the additional loss terms requiring derivatives of all residuals with respect to all parameters of interest."
- **Why unresolved:** While transfer learning is mentioned for the inference PINN, the sensitivity PINN must still be trained from scratch for each new problem configuration.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and validation of meta-learning or pre-trained surrogate approaches that accelerate sensitivity function computation across similar PDE classes.

### Open Question 4
- **Question:** How robust is the D-optimality criterion compared to alternative criteria (A-optimality, E-optimality, modified E-criterion) for PINN-based sensor placement across different noise levels and system dynamics?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors note "Alternative optimality criteria can also be applied as discussed in (Alaña and Theodoropoulos, 2011)" but only implement D-optimality with a brief mention of trace maximization for steady-state cases.
- **Why unresolved:** Different criteria optimize different aspects of parameter uncertainty, and their relative performance with PINN-computed sensitivities remains unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative study across multiple optimality criteria on the benchmark problems with varying noise levels, quantifying trade-offs in parameter estimation accuracy and computational cost.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on differentiable physics constraints, limiting applicability to systems that can be accurately represented by differentiable PDEs
- The current implementation assumes known physics models and does not address scenarios where the governing equations themselves may be uncertain or incomplete
- The computational cost of sensitivity analysis via automatic differentiation scales with the number of parameters, potentially limiting performance for high-dimensional parameter spaces
- The study focuses on relatively simple 1D and 2D cases, and scalability to large-scale 3D systems remains to be demonstrated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Claims regarding improved parameter estimation accuracy with optimal sensor placement compared to random/suboptimal placement
- **Medium Confidence:** Claims about transfer learning effectiveness and mesh-free advantages
- **Medium Confidence:** Scalability assertions to complex geometries

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on a large-scale 3D distributed-parameter system with realistic parameter dimensions to assess computational scalability and sensitivity analysis efficiency
2. Validate performance under uncertain or partially unknown physics models by introducing model discrepancies or noise in the governing equations
3. Evaluate robustness to measurement noise levels beyond those tested, including comparison with established experimental noise conditions from relevant domains
