# A Multi-Axial Mindset for Ontology Design Lessons from Wikidata's Polyhierarchical Structure

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12260

- Primary result: Wikidata's polyhierarchical ontology enables multi-axial classification but current usage shows only ~4% of classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis and just 61 classes are classified along all five examined axes

## Executive Summary
Wikidata's polyhierarchical ontology design enables multi-axial classification, allowing entities to be classified along several orthogonal and overlapping axes (e.g., abstract/concrete, individual/collective) simultaneously. This contrasts with traditional foundational ontologies that enforce a single, exhaustive primary split. The paper shows that while Wikidata's architecture supports modular and scalable ontology construction, current usage reveals incomplete axis coverage—only about 4% of classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis, and fewer than 0.002% of classes are classified along all five examined axes. Multi-axial classification is structurally feasible but underutilized, with only 61 classes typed along five axes. The analysis suggests that expanding and documenting primary splits under entity, with formal mapping to external ontologies, would enhance Wikidata's ontological coherence and interoperability.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates multi-axial classification coverage in Wikidata's ontology by measuring how many classes are typed along multiple orthogonal axes under the root class entity (Q35120). Using SPARQL queries executed via the Qlever endpoint (July 2025), the authors counted classes under each axis using P279 (subclass of), P2738 (disjoint union of), and P2737 (union of) properties. They assessed coverage percentages for each axis and identified multi-axis classification patterns. The analysis revealed structural gaps including 28,648 classes unreachable from entity and severe underutilization of multi-axial typing despite the architecture supporting it.

## Key Results
- Only ~4% of eligible classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis
- Just 61 classes are classified along all five examined axes (abstract/concrete, individual/collective, named/unnamed, observable/unobservable, temporal)
- 28,648 classes are unreachable from the root entity (Q35120) via subclass chains
- Human (Q5) serves as the only example classified along five axes simultaneously

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Polyhierarchical DAG Enables Axis Independence
- Claim: Multiple orthogonal classification axes can coexist without logical conflict when the subclass hierarchy forms a directed acyclic graph rather than a tree.
- Mechanism: DAG structure permits nodes to have multiple parents, so a class like "human" can simultaneously inherit from concrete object, individual entity, and observable entity—each belonging to a different axis—without requiring these parent classes to be related to each other.
- Core assumption: Axes are semantically orthogonal; membership in one axis does not constrain membership in another.
- Evidence anchors: Wikidata's subclass hierarchy ideally forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG)... DAGs allow nodes to have multiple parents, which results in polyhierarchies

### Mechanism 2: Disjoint Union Partitions Create Exhaustive Axes
- Claim: Within each axis, P2738 (disjoint union of) statements partition the domain exhaustively, ensuring every eligible entity belongs to exactly one branch of that axis.
- Mechanism: Each axis defines a complete partition under its root node via disjoint union statements; the same entity can then be classified along multiple axes because disjointness applies only within-axis, not across-axis.
- Core assumption: Each axis is internally coherent and has a philosophical or modeling justification.
- Evidence anchors: These axes consist of mutually disjoint and complete (exhaustive) classes. However, a given class in one axis is not disjoint with a class in another axis

### Mechanism 3: Modular Extensibility via Framework Pluralism
- Claim: New classification axes can be added incrementally without refactoring existing ontology structure.
- Mechanism: Because axes are independent parallel trees under the shared root "entity," adding a new axis introduces no formal contradictions—it simply adds another optional typing dimension.
- Core assumption: Complete axis coverage is not required for the system to function; partial classification is acceptable.
- Evidence anchors: New classification axes can be added without refactoring the entire ontology. This also means that, if a trivial split such as apples-non-apples is added, it does not create any problems

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Primary Split
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts Wikidata's multiple axes against traditional ontologies that enforce a single top-level distinction (e.g., BFO's continuant/occurrent). Understanding this distinction is prerequisite to grasping why Wikidata's design is architecturally different.
  - Quick check question: In BFO, why can't an entity be both a continuant and an occurrent? How does Wikidata's design avoid this constraint?

- Concept: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) vs. Tree
  - Why needed here: Wikidata's ontology is a DAG allowing polyhierarchy, not a tree with single inheritance. This structural difference enables the multi-axial pattern.
  - Quick check question: If class A has two parent classes B and C from different axes, what would go wrong if the hierarchy contained a cycle instead of being acyclic?

- Concept: Orthogonality of Classification Dimensions
  - Why needed here: Multi-axial design assumes axes are logically independent. The paper shows this assumption sometimes fails (triangle axes are entangled).
  - Quick check question: Why is the human-non-human animal split considered "structurally unprincipled" like apples-non-apples, even though it has practical justification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Q35120 (entity) -> [7 axes] -> [subclasses via P279] -> [disjoint unions via P2738]

- Critical path:
  1. Verify your target class is reachable from Q35120 via P279* chain
  2. Identify which axes are relevant for your domain
  3. Ensure typing along each axis doesn't violate within-axis disjointness
  4. Add external ontology mappings where interoperability is needed

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Completeness vs. flexibility: Only 4% of classes are typed on abstract/concrete; system tolerates incompleteness
  - Philosophical rigor vs. pragmatic inclusion: Wikidata allows "former fan of ABBA" as a class—useful set-based modeling, but incompatible with universal-based ontology theory
  - Lattice visualization clarity vs. completeness: Including all axes in lattice visualizations creates noise; the paper recommends selective inclusion of "philosophically motivated, widely used" axes only

- Failure signatures:
  - Classes unreachable from Q35120 (paper found 28,648 such classes)
  - Disjointness violations within a single axis
  - Eligible classes missing axis typing (96% lack abstract/concrete typing)
  - Very low multi-axis coverage (only 61 classes typed along all 5 examined axes)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the coverage queries from Section 9 on your domain to identify which axes are missing typing for your classes of interest
  2. Manually inspect the 105 items with multiple union statements (query provided in Section 5) to understand real multi-axial patterns
  3. Map 10-20 classes from your domain to an external ontology (BFO, DOLCE, or UFO) to test whether Wikidata's current axis structure supports or impedes interoperability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Is the prevalence of the "human vs. non-human animal" distinction in Wikidata driven by anthropocentrism rather than strict biological taxonomy?
- Basis in paper: The authors explicitly state regarding the human/non-human split under the class 'animal': "it would be worthy to investigate if the primacy of this axis is driven by anthropocentrism."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the split as logically arbitrary (similar to "apples-non-apples") but socially prevalent; the underlying motivation for this specific primary axis remains unanalyzed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sociological analysis of the edit history and community discussions surrounding the classification of 'animal' (Q729) to determine if the distinction is utility-driven or bias-driven.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can Wikidata integrate the missing "continuant/occurrent" distinction to improve interoperability with BFO-based ontologies?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that this foundational split "is not represented under entity" and "limits interoperability with ontologies that use these distinctions."
- Why unresolved: The omission is identified as a gap that hinders mapping to established systems like BFO and OBO, but no implementation strategy is proposed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modeling proposal adding the continuant/occurrent axis under entity (Q35120) with formal references to BFO definitions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What mechanisms are required to increase the coverage of multi-axial typing, given that only 4% of classes are currently typed along the abstract/concrete axis?
- Basis in paper: While the paper demonstrates that the architecture supports multi-axiality, empirical results show severe underutilization (only 61 classes typed along five axes).
- Why unresolved: The paper concludes that "future work should focus on expanding principled primary splits" but does not specify how to resolve the gap between structural capacity and actual usage.
- What evidence would resolve it: Deployment of constraint checks or automated classification tools that result in a measurable increase in axis coverage percentages.

## Limitations
- Coverage gaps: Multi-axial classification is structurally possible but severely underutilized (only ~4% of classes are typed along the abstract/concrete axis)
- Orthogonality violations: Some classification axes are logically entangled (e.g., triangle axes where equilateral/non-equilateral is not fully orthogonal to right/acute/obtuse)
- Structural incompleteness: Approximately 28,648 classes are unreachable from the root entity via subclass chains

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The structural feasibility of multi-axial classification through Wikidata's DAG architecture and disjoint union statements
- Medium Confidence: The practical utility and adoption of multi-axial classification given the extremely low coverage rates
- Low Confidence: The completeness and accuracy of the coverage measurements due to Wikidata's dynamic nature and query complexity

## Next Checks
1. Re-run the SPARQL queries from Section 9 on a representative sample of domain-specific classes (e.g., medical entities, geographical features) to assess whether the low multi-axis coverage is a general pattern or domain-specific.
2. Systematically identify and document all cases where classification axes are entangled (similar to the triangle example) and create a formal test suite to flag potential orthogonality violations when new axes are proposed.
3. Map 50-100 Wikidata classes from high-coverage axes (like abstract/concrete) to established ontologies (BFO, DOLCE, UFO) to evaluate whether Wikidata's multi-axial structure actually facilitates or impedes interoperability with external ontological frameworks.
