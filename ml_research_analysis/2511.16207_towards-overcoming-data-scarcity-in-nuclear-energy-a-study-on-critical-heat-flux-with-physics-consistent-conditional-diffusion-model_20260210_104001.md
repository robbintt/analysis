# Towards Overcoming Data Scarcity in Nuclear Energy: A Study on Critical Heat Flux with Physics-consistent Conditional Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.16207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16207
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Diffusion models with 6.8% mean relative error successfully generate synthetic CHF data that maintains physical consistency

## Executive Summary
This study addresses data scarcity in nuclear energy applications by leveraging deep generative models to synthesize critical heat flux (CHF) data. Using a public dataset of 24,579 CHF measurements, the researchers trained diffusion models (DMs) and conditional diffusion models (CDMs) to generate synthetic data that captures the statistical properties and correlations of the original dataset. The CDM demonstrates high accuracy with a mean relative error of 6.8% when compared to real CHF values. Physical consistency was validated using theoretical models, showing that generated outlet equilibrium quality values maintain proper relationships with thermal-hydraulic parameters. The results indicate that DMs and CDMs can effectively augment CHF datasets, improving data availability for nuclear energy applications while maintaining physical realism.

## Method Summary
The study employs diffusion models and conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic critical heat flux data. A public dataset of 24,579 CHF measurements serves as the training foundation. The diffusion model learns the joint distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and CHF values, while the conditional diffusion model generates CHF values under user-specified conditions. Both models are trained to capture the statistical properties and correlations present in the original dataset. Physical consistency validation is performed using theoretical models to ensure that generated outlet equilibrium quality values maintain proper relationships with thermal-hydraulic parameters. The models' performance is evaluated through mean relative error calculations and uncertainty quantification analysis.

## Key Results
- CDM achieves mean relative error of 6.8% when compared to real CHF values
- Low variability in generated samples with mean relative standard deviation of 4.40%
- Generated outlet equilibrium quality values maintain proper physical relationships with thermal-hydraulic parameters
- Models successfully capture statistical properties and correlations in original CHF dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Diffusion models excel at learning complex, high-dimensional distributions by gradually denoising data through a Markov chain process. This makes them particularly effective for generating synthetic nuclear data that preserves intricate physical relationships. The conditional variant allows for targeted generation under specific operating conditions, directly addressing the need for scenario-specific data in nuclear applications. By learning the full joint distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and CHF values, the models can interpolate between existing data points while maintaining physical consistency. The gradual denoising process inherently captures the multi-scale correlations present in nuclear thermal-hydraulic systems, resulting in synthetic data that reflects real-world behavior patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- Critical Heat Flux (CHF): The thermal limit where a phase change occurs during heating, causing localized overheating of the heat transfer surface. Why needed: CHF is a critical safety parameter in nuclear reactor design and operation. Quick check: Verify that generated CHF values fall within physically plausible ranges for given operating conditions.
- Diffusion Models: Generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process through a Markov chain. Why needed: Capable of learning complex joint distributions of thermal-hydraulic parameters. Quick check: Validate that generated samples reproduce statistical properties of training data.
- Conditional Generation: Process of generating outputs conditioned on specific input parameters. Why needed: Enables targeted data generation for specific operating scenarios. Quick check: Compare generated distributions across different condition sets.
- Outlet Equilibrium Quality: The quality (vapor mass fraction) of the fluid at the channel outlet under equilibrium conditions. Why needed: Key parameter linking thermal-hydraulic conditions to CHF behavior. Quick check: Ensure generated quality values maintain theoretical relationships with other parameters.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Data Preprocessing -> Diffusion Model Training -> Conditional Diffusion Model Training -> Physical Consistency Validation -> Performance Evaluation

Critical Path:
Raw CHF data → Feature extraction and normalization → Joint distribution learning via DM → Conditional generation via CDM → Physical consistency checks → Performance metrics calculation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model complexity vs. training efficiency: More complex architectures may capture finer details but require more computational resources
- Conditional flexibility vs. generation accuracy: More flexible condition specifications may reduce generation accuracy
- Physical constraints vs. data-driven generation: Strict physical constraints may limit the model's ability to capture rare but valid scenarios

Failure Signatures:
- Mode collapse resulting in limited diversity of generated samples
- Physical inconsistency where generated values violate known thermodynamic relationships
- High variance in generated samples indicating poor model convergence
- Systematic bias toward certain operating conditions or parameter ranges

First Experiments:
1. Generate CHF values for a narrow range of thermal-hydraulic conditions and compare distributions with real data
2. Test physical consistency by generating outlet equilibrium quality values and validating against theoretical models
3. Evaluate generation accuracy across the full range of operating conditions in the dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 24,579 samples may not fully capture diversity of all possible operating conditions in nuclear reactors
- Study focuses on single nuclear phenomenon (CHF) with generalizability to other applications untested
- Physical consistency validation relies on theoretical models which themselves may have limitations or uncertainties
- Computational efficiency and potential for mode collapse in diffusion models not discussed

## Confidence
High: Diffusion models with 6.8% mean relative error successfully generate synthetic CHF data that maintains physical consistency
Medium: Broader applicability to other nuclear energy contexts remains untested due to limited scope

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on additional nuclear phenomena beyond CHF to assess generalizability across nuclear applications
2. Conduct blind validation studies with nuclear engineers to evaluate practical utility of generated data in real-world scenarios
3. Perform long-term stability tests to ensure consistent performance of diffusion models across extended training periods and varying input conditions
