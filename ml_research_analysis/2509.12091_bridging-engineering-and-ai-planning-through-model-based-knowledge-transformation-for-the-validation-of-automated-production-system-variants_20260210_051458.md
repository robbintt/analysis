# Bridging Engineering and AI Planning through Model-Based Knowledge Transformation for the Validation of Automated Production System Variants

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.12091
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12091
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** Method embeds symbolic AI planning semantics into SysML models via profile, enabling automated PDDL generation and validation of production system variants

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to embed symbolic AI planning semantics into SysML-based engineering models using a dedicated profile. The approach enables automated generation of PDDL domain and problem files directly from engineering artifacts, maintaining consistency between system and planning descriptions. Applied to aircraft assembly, the method validated generated plans using VAL and DELFI planners, demonstrating correct semantics and cost-optimal sequences.

The research addresses the challenge of translating MBSE models into AI planning descriptions by introducing a systematic mapping between SysML elements and PDDL constructs. This bidirectional transformation supports traceable variant analysis and repeatable workflows, reducing manual effort in planning system validation. The approach was demonstrated through a collar screwing system case study with successful plan generation and validation.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a SysML profile with stereotypes like `<<PDDL Type>>`, `<<PDDL Action>>`, and `<<PDDL Predicate>>` to annotate engineering models with planning semantics. Product instance data is imported and annotated using the same profile. A template-based transformation using Apache Velocity converts the annotated SysML model into PDDL domain and problem files. The process maintains consistency between system descriptions and planning representations, enabling automated validation of production system variants through plan generation and cost analysis.

## Key Results
- Automated generation of syntactically valid PDDL from SysML models successfully passed VAL validation
- Generated plans for aircraft assembly variants were validated as feasible and cost-optimal using Delfi planner
- The approach reduced manual effort in creating planning descriptions while maintaining traceability between engineering and planning domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a formal semantic bridge between MBSE and AI planning through systematic annotation. The SysML profile provides a structured way to map engineering concepts to planning constructs, while the template-based transformation ensures consistent generation of PDDL syntax. This maintains the semantic integrity between the system model and its planning representation, enabling automated validation that would otherwise require manual translation.

## Foundational Learning
- **SysML Profile Stereotypes** - why needed: Enable semantic annotation of engineering models with planning concepts; quick check: Verify that all required stereotypes are applied correctly to model elements
- **PDDL Domain/Problem Files** - why needed: Standard format for expressing planning problems; quick check: Validate generated PDDL syntax using VAL
- **Template-based Transformation** - why needed: Automate conversion from annotated models to planning descriptions; quick check: Ensure transformation produces complete and consistent PDDL output
- **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** - why needed: Provides structured approach to system description and analysis; quick check: Confirm MBSE model captures all relevant system elements
- **Automated Plan Validation** - why needed: Verify feasibility and optimality of generated plans; quick check: Use VAL to check syntactic validity and planner to verify solution quality
- **OCL Constraints** - why needed: Enforce model consistency rules during annotation; quick check: Validate all OCL constraints pass during model verification

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** SysML Tool -> Annotation Profile -> Apache Velocity Templates -> PDDL Files -> VAL/Planner -> Validation Results
- **Critical Path:** Model annotation → Template transformation → PDDL generation → Plan validation
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Manual annotation provides flexibility but requires expertise; automated generation ensures consistency but depends on template accuracy
- **Failure Signatures:** Invalid PDDL syntax, plan infeasibility, missing type definitions, broken references
- **First Experiments:**
  1. Create simple SysML model with basic types and actions, apply profile stereotypes, generate minimal PDDL, validate with VAL
  2. Import product instance data, apply predicates, generate problem file, verify goal conditions match requirements
  3. Run complete transformation pipeline on case study model, validate both domain and problem files, generate and validate plans

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can an interactive assistant using rule inference or LLM-based prompting effectively guide users through the semi-automated annotation of planning constructs in SysML models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that "an interactive assistant is envisioned to support the annotation of planning constructs" and suggest "techniques based on rule inference or LLM-based prompting may assist in semi-automated annotation."
- Why unresolved: The current workflow requires manual application of stereotypes by users; no such assistant has been implemented or evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and empirical evaluation of an annotation assistant measuring annotation accuracy, completeness, and time savings compared to fully manual annotation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the extraction and mapping of instance-level product information from external engineering tools to the MBSE environment be fully automated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the extraction and mapping of instance-level product information remains partially manual" and state "further automation is needed in linking engineering data to planning tasks."
- Why unresolved: The current Phase III requires manual transfer of product data from 3DExperience into the modeling environment; no automated interface exists.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working interface between external product data tools and the MBSE environment that automatically extracts, transforms, and annotates instance-level data with minimal manual intervention.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the quantifiable reduction in manual effort and modeling time when using the automated PDDL generation approach compared to creating planning descriptions manually?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims the method "reduces manual effort" but provides no quantitative comparison or user study measuring actual time savings, error reduction, or effort metrics.
- Why unresolved: No controlled experiments or comparative evaluations were conducted to measure the efficiency gains of the automated approach versus baseline manual methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled user study comparing time, error rates, and cognitive load between engineers using the proposed method versus manual PDDL creation for equivalent planning tasks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the proposed method scale to larger, more complex production systems beyond the single aircraft assembly case study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The evaluation is limited to one case study involving a single robotic cell with 27 types, 21 predicates, 3 functions, and 12 actions. Scalability to industrial-scale systems with hundreds of elements is untested.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not demonstrate application to larger systems or analyze computational complexity and usability degradation as model size increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the method to at least two additional case studies of varying complexity, including a large-scale production system, with analysis of transformation time, model navigation overhead, and planner performance.

## Limitations
- Case study model is only partially described, requiring manual reconstruction for replication
- Integration details between modeling tool and transformation engine are incomplete
- Validation limited to two planners on a single industrial scenario without broader comparative analysis

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The core methodology of using SysML profiles to annotate planning semantics is well-documented and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** The template-based transformation approach is feasible but requires additional configuration details for full replication
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the approach to other domains and planners remains untested

## Next Checks
1. Implement the complete case study model from paper descriptions and validate PDDL generation against the provided examples
2. Test the transformation pipeline with alternative planners (e.g., Fast Downward) to assess compatibility
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the OCL constraints to evaluate robustness when model specifications change
