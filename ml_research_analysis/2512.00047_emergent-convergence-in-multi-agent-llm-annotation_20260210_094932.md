# Emergent Convergence in Multi-Agent LLM Annotation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.00047
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00047
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: Multi-agent LLM discussions show increasing lexical convergence and semantic compression over interaction rounds, with asymmetric influence patterns emerging between models.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a simulation framework for multi-agent LLM discussions in qualitative coding tasks, examining how artificial annotators converge on semantic codes through interaction. The study generates 7,500 discussions across different group sizes (2, 3, 5) and rounds (1-5), producing over 125,000 utterances to track convergence patterns. Results demonstrate that lexical agreement (measured by ROUGE scores) increases with interaction rounds, while intrinsic dimensionality of code embeddings decreases, indicating semantic compression. The framework reveals asymmetric influence patterns between models and shows that confidence proxies increase over time without corresponding increases in toxicity or sentiment changes.

## Method Summary
The simulation framework implements a multi-agent discussion system where LLM models interact as annotators, generating utterances in structured turns. Each discussion involves group sizes of 2, 3, or 5 agents across 1-5 rounds, with models alternating between proposer and receiver roles. The system tracks code stability, semantic self-consistency, confidence, toxicity, and geometric properties of output embeddings. ROUGE scores measure lexical convergence between model outputs, while intrinsic dimensionality quantifies semantic compression in embedding space. The framework also analyzes asymmetric influence patterns and monitors sentiment and syntactic complexity to ensure controlled interactions.

## Key Results
- ROUGE scores increase monotonically with interaction rounds, showing clear lexical convergence
- Intrinsic dimensionality of code embeddings decreases over rounds, indicating semantic compression
- Asymmetric influence patterns emerge between models, with some consistently shaping others' outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-turn interaction enables emergent convergence through iterative refinement and negotiation-like behaviors. As models exchange ideas, they progressively align their semantic representations while maintaining controlled syntactic complexity. The asymmetric influence patterns suggest that certain models act as anchors or leaders in the discussion, guiding the group toward consensus. The framework captures these dynamics without requiring explicit role prompting, allowing natural emergence of leader-follower relationships based on model capabilities and interaction history.

## Foundational Learning

**ROUGE Score Calculation**: Measures lexical overlap between model outputs; needed to quantify convergence, quick check via example score calculation between two similar texts.

**Intrinsic Dimensionality**: Captures semantic compression in embedding space; needed to understand information efficiency gains, quick check by comparing pre/post discussion embedding dimensions.

**Embedding Space Geometry**: Analyzes how semantic representations evolve; needed to track abstract convergence patterns, quick check by visualizing embedding clusters before/after discussions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Multi-Agent Discussion Engine -> Utterance Generator -> ROUGE Analyzer -> Embedding Extractor -> Dimensionality Calculator -> Output Metrics

**Critical Path**: The discussion engine and utterance generator form the core, with convergence metrics depending on successful model interactions and output generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Simulated interactions vs. real human dynamics (speed and control vs. ecological validity); quantitative metrics vs. qualitative understanding (measurable convergence vs. interpretability).

**Failure Signatures**: Low ROUGE score improvement indicates poor interaction design; dimensionality increase suggests semantic drift; inconsistent influence patterns may reveal model capability mismatches.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run single-round discussions to establish baseline convergence metrics
2. Compare convergence rates across different model combinations
3. Test sensitivity to group size variations while holding rounds constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Simulation framework may not capture full complexity of human annotator dynamics and power relationships
- Reliance on ROUGE scores may miss semantically equivalent but lexically divergent agreements
- Limited model combinations tested (only specific pairs of GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Lexical convergence patterns and geometric dimensionality reduction findings are well-supported by extensive simulation data.

**Medium Confidence**: Asymmetric influence patterns and negotiation behaviors are suggestive but require further validation.

**Low Confidence**: Practical implications for real-world annotation workflows remain speculative without human evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing model-converged codes against expert human annotations
2. Apply the framework to actual qualitative datasets rather than simulated text samples
3. Test convergence patterns with additional model combinations including open-source alternatives
