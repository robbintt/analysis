# Modeling Professionalism in Expert Questioning through Linguistic Differentiation
## Quick Facts

- Introduces linguistic framework for modeling professionalism in expert questioning with 96% classification accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study develops a linguistic framework to model professionalism in expert questioning, using financial analyst questions as a testbed. By annotating structural and pragmatic features including discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types, the authors demonstrate these elements strongly correlate with human judgments of professionalism and question origin (human vs. LLM-generated). A Random Forest classifier trained solely on these interpretable features achieves 96% accuracy, outperforming SVM and gemini-2.0-flash baselines. The results show professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured through linguistically grounded modeling.

## Method Summary
The study employs a mixed-methods approach combining manual annotation of financial analyst questions with machine learning classification. Researchers first annotate questions for 20 linguistic features including discourse regulators, prefaces, question types, and pragmatic functions. These annotations are then used to train and evaluate a Random Forest classifier, which is compared against SVM and LLM-based baselines. Human judgments of professionalism serve as ground truth for validation.

## Key Results
- Random Forest classifier achieves 96% accuracy in distinguishing professional from non-professional questions
- Linguistic features show strong correlation with both human judgments and question origin
- Conciseness and readability emerge as key indicators of professionalism, challenging assumptions about complexity
- Model outperforms both traditional ML (SVM) and LLM-based baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach succeeds by operationalizing professionalism through observable linguistic markers rather than abstract concepts. By focusing on structural and pragmatic features that can be systematically annotated, the framework creates a bridge between human perception of professionalism and machine-readable patterns. The emphasis on conciseness and readability aligns with expert communication principles, where clarity and efficiency are valued over complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- Discourse Regulators (why needed: signal question structure and intent; quick check: identify words like "firstly," "secondly," "finally")
- Pragmatic Functions (why needed: capture communicative purpose; quick check: classify as information-seeking, clarification, or challenge)
- Structural Complexity (why needed: measure question organization; quick check: count subordinate clauses and embedded questions)
- Readability Metrics (why needed: quantify accessibility; quick check: apply Flesch-Kincaid or similar measures)
- Question Origin Detection (why needed: validate model against known differences; quick check: compare human vs. LLM-generated patterns)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Financial Questions -> Annotation Pipeline -> Feature Extraction -> Random Forest Classifier -> Professionalism Score
**Critical Path:** Question Collection → Manual Annotation → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Validation → Deployment
**Design Tradeoffs:** Prioritized interpretability over complexity, choosing a feature-based Random Forest over black-box neural approaches. This enables transparent analysis of which linguistic features drive classifications but may miss subtle patterns.
**Failure Signatures:** Model may misclassify domain-specific jargon as unprofessional, struggle with cross-cultural variations in professional discourse, or fail when linguistic markers don't align with actual expertise.
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing each feature to identify most critical predictors 2) Cross-domain validation on medical/legal questions 3) Temporal analysis of how professional questioning evolves across earnings seasons

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on financial analyst questions may limit generalizability to other professional domains
- Dataset from earnings call transcripts may not represent full spectrum of professional questioning contexts
- Annotation process relies on specific linguistic features that may not capture all aspects of professionalism
- Relatively small number of features (20) in Random Forest model could miss nuanced patterns

## Confidence
- High confidence: Correlation between linguistic features and human judgments, superiority of Random Forest classifier
- Medium confidence: Generalizability to other professional domains, comprehensiveness of linguistic feature set
- Low confidence: Assumption that conciseness and readability universally indicate professionalism across all contexts

## Next Checks
1. Replicate study using question-answer pairs from different professional domains (medical consultations, legal depositions) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct longitudinal study examining how linguistic features of professional questioning evolve over time within organizations
3. Perform ablation study on Random Forest model to identify most critical features for classifying professionalism
