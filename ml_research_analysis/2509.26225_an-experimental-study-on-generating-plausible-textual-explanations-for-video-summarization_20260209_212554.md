# An Experimental Study on Generating Plausible Textual Explanations for Video Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26225
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26225
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLaVA-OneVision generates plausible textual explanations for video summarization; fragment-level description followed by summarization yields highest plausibility scores

## Executive Summary
This study investigates generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization outcomes by integrating the LLaVA-OneVision large multimodal model with an existing multi-granular explanation framework. The authors propose evaluating plausibility through semantic overlap between textual descriptions of visual explanations and corresponding video summaries using SBERT and SimCSE sentence embeddings. Experimental results using CA-SUM on SumMe and TVSum datasets show that while attention-based explanations are most faithful, LIME-based explanations are more plausible when condensed to single fragments. However, when explanations include three fragments, the most faithful attention-based explanations also become the most plausible. The study identifies that generating fragment-level descriptions followed by summarization produces more plausible explanations than describing all fragments together.

## Method Summary
The framework extends a multi-granular explanation framework by integrating LLaVA-OneVision for generating natural language descriptions of visual explanations. CA-SUM pre-trained models generate video summaries, while explanation methods (attention-based and LIME-based) identify influential fragments. LLaVA-OneVision-7B with 4-bit quantization generates textual descriptions using specific prompts. Plausibility is evaluated by computing cosine similarity between sentence embeddings (SBERT and SimCSE) of explanation descriptions and video summary descriptions. Faithfulness is measured using Disc+ (Kendall's correlation). Two approaches are tested: Approach 1 describes all fragments together in one prompt, while Approach 2 generates individual fragment descriptions followed by summarization.

## Key Results
- Attention-based explanations achieve highest faithfulness scores across all experiments
- LIME-based explanations show higher plausibility than attention-based when using single fragments
- When using three fragments, attention-based explanations become both most faithful and most plausible
- Approach 2 (fragment-level descriptions followed by summarization) consistently produces higher plausibility scores than Approach 1

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Semantic Alignment via Embedding Space Proximity
A Large Multimodal Model generates textual descriptions for both visual explanations and video summaries, which are converted into dense vector representations using SBERT and SimCSE. The cosine similarity between these vectors serves as the plausibility metric. This mechanism assumes sentence embedding models reliably capture semantic relevance between video-derived textual descriptions.

### Mechanism 2: Explanatory Detail Level Modulates Faithfulness-Plausibility Alignment
The relationship between faithfulness and plausibility depends on explanation granularity. Condensed explanations (single fragment) show misalignment where higher faithfulness doesn't imply higher plausibility. Detailed explanations (three fragments) align these metrics, likely because multiple faithful fragments provide complete semantic context.

### Mechanism 3: Fragment-Level Generation with Summarization for Optimal Plausibility
Generating descriptions for each fragment individually and then summarizing (Approach 2) yields higher plausibility than describing all fragments together (Approach 1). This hierarchical process preserves more detail and semantic nuance from each fragment compared to a single complex summarization task.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Video Summarization as a Frame/Fragment Selection Task**
  - Why needed: The framework operates on video summarization network output (CA-SUM), which selects key-fragments based on importance scores
  - Quick check: What is the fundamental output of the video summarization network that needs explanation?

- **Concept: Faithfulness vs. Plausibility in Explainable AI (XAI)**
  - Why needed: The research question hinges on distinguishing faithfulness (explanation accuracy) from plausibility (human alignment)
  - Quick check: Would an explanation revealing model reliance on data artifacts be high faithfulness, high plausibility, or neither?

- **Concept: Sentence Embeddings and Cosine Similarity**
  - Why needed: Plausibility evaluation relies entirely on this NLP technique to map text to high-dimensional vectors
  - Quick check: What does higher cosine similarity between explanation and summary embeddings signify?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Video Summarization Network (CA-SUM) -> Explanation Generator (Attention/LIME) -> Large Multimodal Model (LLaVA-OneVision) -> Plausibility Evaluator (SBERT/SimCSE)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Run CA-SUM to get video summary (top-3 fragments)
  2. Run Explanation Generator to get visual explanation (top-1 or top-3 fragments)
  3. Feed summary and explanation fragments into LLaVA-OneVision using chosen approach
  4. Obtain textual descriptions for both
  5. Compute plausibility score using sentence embedding model

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Granularity (1 vs. 3 fragments): Condensed explanations are less computationally intensive but misalign faithfulness-plausibility; detailed explanations align metrics better but require more processing
  - Text Generation Approach (Approach 1 vs. 2): Approach 1 is faster but less plausible; Approach 2 is more plausible but involves multiple LMM calls increasing latency and cost
  - Explanation Method (Attention vs. LIME): Attention is more faithful but may be less plausible for condensed explanations; LIME is model-agnostic but may be less faithful

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low Plausibility, High Faithfulness: Model decisions based on semantically irrelevant features (e.g., "Clever Hans" effect)
  - Consistently Low Similarity Scores: LMM generation failures or embedding space mismatches
  - Hallucination in Explanations: LMM generates plausible but factually incorrect details undermining plausibility validity

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement Approach 1 pipeline on SumMe subset, verify similarity scores in [0,1] range
  2. Generate visual explanations with k=1 and k=3 fragments, compare faithfulness (Disc+) and plausibility
  3. Implement Approach 2, compare plausibility scores against Approach 1 for k=3 case, monitor LMM inference time

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Does automated semantic overlap metric (SBERT/SimCSE) correlate with human assessment of explanation plausibility?
  - Basis: Authors define plausibility as human reasoning alignment but evaluate using automated similarity without human validation
  - Resolution: User study correlating human plausibility ratings with computed semantic overlap scores

- **Open Question 2:** Do findings regarding optimal explanation generation approach generalize to other video summarization architectures and LMMs?
  - Basis: Experiments restricted to CA-SUM and LLaVA-OneVision
  - Resolution: Replicate experiments using alternative summarization models and LMMs to verify fragment-then-summarize superiority

- **Open Question 3:** How does the number of influential fragments (k) affect faithfulness-plausibility trade-off?
  - Basis: Study identifies flip between k=1 and k=3 but doesn't test intermediate or higher values
  - Resolution: Parameter sweep varying k (1-10) to plot faithfulness versus plausibility trajectory

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on semantic similarity between LMM-generated descriptions, which may not fully capture human judgment of plausibility
- Findings based on two specific video datasets (SumMe and TVSum) with short consumer video characteristics
- LLaVA-OneVision model introduces potential hallucinations affecting both explanations and evaluation
- Computational costs of proposed approach, particularly multiple LMM calls in Approach 2, are not addressed

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Semantic Alignment): Medium confidence - methodology sound but human validation untested
- Mechanism 2 (Detail Level Alignment): High confidence - directly supported by experimental results
- Mechanism 3 (Fragment-Level Generation): Medium confidence - experimental results support claim but computational costs unanalyzed

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation validation comparing human plausibility ratings with embedding-based plausibility scores across different explanation granularities
2. Test complete pipeline on third video dataset with different characteristics (longer videos, different domains) to verify generalization
3. Measure and compare inference time and costs for Approach 1 versus Approach 2, calculating plausibility improvement per computational resource unit
