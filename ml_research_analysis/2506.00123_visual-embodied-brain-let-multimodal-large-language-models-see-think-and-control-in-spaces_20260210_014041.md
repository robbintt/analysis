# Visual Embodied Brain: Let Multimodal Large Language Models See, Think, and Control in Spaces
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00123
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: VeBrain achieves +5.6% improvement on MMVet and +50% gains on legged robot tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VeBrain, a unified framework that integrates multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and robotic control into a single model. The key innovation is reformulating robotic control as text-based tasks in 2D visual space, specifically keypoint detection and embodied skill recognition, rather than direct action policy learning. This approach enables VeBrain to maintain strong multimodal capabilities while adding control abilities. The framework includes a novel robotic adapter that converts textual control signals into executable motion policies.

## Method Summary
VeBrain uses a novel reformulation approach where robotic control tasks are converted into text-based 2D visual space tasks through keypoint detection and embodied skill recognition. The framework is trained on VeBrain-600k, a dataset of 600k instruction samples covering multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and control tasks. A robotic adapter translates textual commands into motion policies, enabling the model to execute physical actions. The training process combines human annotation with semi-automated data generation using multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Key Results
- +5.6% improvement on MMVet benchmark compared to Qwen2.5-VL
- +50% average gains on legged robot tasks
- Excels at both 2D multimodal tasks and 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing complex embodied tasks into three simpler components: multimodal understanding, visual-spatial reasoning, and robotic control. By reformulating control as 2D text-based tasks rather than direct policy learning, the model can leverage existing multimodal reasoning capabilities. The robotic adapter serves as a bridge between textual commands and physical actions, maintaining the unified architecture while enabling control functionality.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal understanding: Why needed - to process and interpret various input modalities; Quick check - performance on MMVet benchmark
- Visual-spatial reasoning: Why needed - to navigate and understand 3D environments; Quick check - performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks
- Robotic control reformulation: Why needed - to enable control without sacrificing multimodal capabilities; Quick check - success rate on control tasks
- Keypoint detection: Why needed - to identify important spatial locations in 2D space; Quick check - accuracy on keypoint localization
- Embodied skill recognition: Why needed - to map visual observations to control actions; Quick check - recognition accuracy on skill identification
- Robotic adapter design: Why needed - to translate textual commands into physical motions; Quick check - execution success rate

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Multimodal Input -> Understanding Module -> Spatial Reasoning Module -> Control Module -> Robotic Adapter -> Physical Actions

Critical path: The understanding and spatial reasoning modules must successfully process inputs before the control module can generate appropriate commands, which the robotic adapter then executes.

Design tradeoffs: The choice to reformulate 3D control as 2D text-based tasks simplifies the learning problem but may limit expressiveness for complex physical interactions.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on tasks requiring fine-grained physical manipulation, failure to generalize beyond training distribution, degraded performance with sensor noise.

First experiments:
1. Test multimodal understanding on MMVet benchmark
2. Evaluate spatial reasoning on 3D navigation tasks
3. Assess control capability on basic legged robot locomotion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond VeBrain-600k training domains remains uncertain
- Real-world deployment in unstructured environments not validated
- Semi-automated data generation may introduce quality inconsistencies
- Robotic adapter performance in noisy environments unproven

## Confidence
- Multimodal understanding improvements: High confidence
- 2D visual space reformulation effectiveness: Medium confidence
- Robotic control capability generalization: Medium confidence
- Dataset quality and coverage: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Deploy VeBrain on a physical robot in unstructured environments to test real-world robustness and measure performance degradation compared to controlled benchmarks
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies removing the multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to quantify its contribution to the +50% improvement on legged robot tasks
3. Evaluate VeBrain's performance on tasks requiring cross-modal reasoning beyond the VeBrain-600k training distribution to assess true generalization capability
