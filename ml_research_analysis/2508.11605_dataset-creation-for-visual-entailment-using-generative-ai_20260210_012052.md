# Dataset Creation for Visual Entailment using Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11605
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11605
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Synthetic data trained classifiers achieve F1 scores of 0.686 on SNLI-VE and 0.384 on SICK-VTE, only slightly lower than real data trained models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of creating large, high-quality datasets for visual entailment tasks, which are typically labor-intensive to produce manually. The authors propose generating synthetic data by using the premise text from the SNLI textual entailment dataset as prompts for the Stable Diffusion image generator, replacing each textual premise with a corresponding image. They evaluate the quality of the generated images both intrinsically (via CLIP-based similarity metrics) and extrinsically (by training visual entailment classifiers on the synthetic data and testing on real datasets).

## Method Summary
The authors generate synthetic visual entailment data by prompting Stable Diffusion (using the Realistic Vision v51 checkpoint) with premise captions from the SNLI dataset to create corresponding images. The generated images are evaluated intrinsically using CLIP feature similarity metrics including cosine similarity distributions and recall@k/precision@k scores. Extrinsically, they train a multi-layer perceptron classifier on fused CLIP feature vectors (combining premise and hypothesis embeddings through concatenation, element-wise sum, difference, and product) and evaluate on SNLI-VE and SICK-VTE test sets. The training uses 100 epochs with selection based on dev set performance.

## Key Results
- Classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve F1 score of 0.686 on SNLI-VE test set versus 0.703 for real data trained models
- Cross-dataset evaluation shows F1 score of 0.384 on SICK-VTE with synthetic training data versus 0.400 with real data
- CLIP similarity between generated and original images shows normal distribution with mean ~0.465 and standard deviation ~0.085

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the strong semantic understanding of both Stable Diffusion for image generation and CLIP for cross-modal feature extraction. By using textually similar but visually distinct premises from SNLI as prompts, the method generates images that preserve the semantic content while providing the visual modality needed for entailment tasks. The CLIP-based evaluation ensures that generated images maintain semantic similarity to their source captions, while the classifier training demonstrates that these synthetic image-text pairs can effectively substitute for manually curated visual entailment data.

## Foundational Learning
- Visual entailment task: Understanding that VE requires determining logical relationships between images and text, which differs from pure image classification
- CLIP model capabilities: Essential for both feature extraction and cross-modal similarity measurement between generated images and hypotheses
- Stable Diffusion prompt engineering: Critical for generating semantically faithful images from textual premises
- Feature fusion strategies: Necessary for combining premise and hypothesis representations effectively for classification

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Stable Diffusion -> Image Generation -> CLIP Feature Extraction -> MLP Classifier -> Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path**
Premise text → Stable Diffusion generation → CLIP feature extraction → Feature fusion → MLP classification → F1/accuracy metrics

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Using SNLI premises provides abundant training data but may not capture all VE-specific visual concepts
- CLIP-based evaluation offers scalable quality assessment but may not capture all aspects of image quality
- MLP classifier is simple but may limit performance compared to more complex architectures

**Failure Signatures**
- Low CLIP similarity scores indicate poor semantic alignment between generated images and source premises
- Large performance gaps between synthetic and real trained models suggest quality issues with generated data
- Poor cross-dataset generalization indicates overfitting to specific visual patterns in synthetic data

**3 First Experiments**
1. Generate a small sample of Stable Diffusion images from SNLI premises and qualitatively assess semantic alignment
2. Compute CLIP similarity metrics between generated and original images to establish baseline distributions
3. Train MLP classifier on synthetic data and evaluate on SNLI-VE test set to measure performance impact

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, loss function, activation functions, dropout) could affect classifier performance
- Unspecified CLIP model variant may impact feature extraction quality and consistency
- Stable Diffusion inference parameters (steps, guidance scale, scheduler) are not specified, potentially affecting image quality

## Confidence
- High confidence in the methodology framework and evaluation approach (intrinsic CLIP similarity metrics and extrinsic classifier performance)
- Medium confidence in the reported performance numbers, pending verification of exact implementation details
- Low confidence in the absolute quality of generated images without direct inspection of samples

## Next Checks
1. Verify CLIP similarity metrics by computing the cosine similarity distribution between generated and original images, expecting a mean around 0.465 with standard deviation around 0.085
2. Reproduce the MLP classifier training with specified fusion method and hidden layer size, comparing F1 scores on SNLI-VE test set
3. Generate a small sample of Stable Diffusion images from SNLI premises to qualitatively assess whether the generated images preserve the semantic content of the original captions
