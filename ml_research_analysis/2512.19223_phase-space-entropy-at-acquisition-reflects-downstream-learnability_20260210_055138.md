- Primary result: Introduces phase-space entropy measure that predicts downstream learnability from acquisition policy

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel phase-space entropy measure that quantifies how acquisition policies affect the joint spatial-spectral structure of signals. The measure, based on Husimi distribution and band-normalized entropy change (∆SB), demonstrates that smaller entropy changes correlate with better downstream learnability across multiple domains including vision, MRI, and MIMO communications. The framework enables zero-training acquisition design by predicting which sampling patterns will yield the most learnable representations.

## Method Summary
The method defines phase-space entropy using a Husimi distribution that captures joint spatial and spectral information of acquired signals. The entropy change (∆SB) is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the acquired signal and the original signal, normalized by bandwidth. This measure is then correlated with downstream learnability by training models on data acquired using different policies and measuring performance. The framework is validated through experiments showing that periodic sampling increases entropy via spectral folding while random sampling preserves it, and that ∆SB can effectively guide acquisition policy selection without requiring model training.

## Key Results
- Periodic sampling increases phase-space entropy via coherent spectral folding, while random sampling preserves it
- |∆SB| correlates with downstream learnability across vision, MRI, and MIMO domains
- ∆SB discriminates between sampling geometries better than conventional distortion proxies
- Framework enables zero-training acquisition design (e.g., selecting MRI masks without model training)
- Validated with over-the-air MIMO measurements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The phase-space entropy captures the structural information loss during acquisition by measuring changes in the joint spatial-spectral distribution. When acquisition policies introduce aliasing or structural distortion, the Husimi distribution becomes more spread out, increasing entropy. This entropy increase reflects the loss of coherent structure necessary for downstream learning tasks. The band-normalization ensures the measure is invariant to signal power changes, focusing on structural rather than amplitude effects.

## Foundational Learning
- Husimi distribution: Quasi-probability representation in phase space that captures both position and momentum information; needed for joint spatial-spectral analysis
- Spectral folding: Aliasing effect when sampling below Nyquist rate; quick check: occurs when fs < 2fmax
- Entropy measures: Quantify uncertainty/disorder in distributions; needed to capture information loss
- Learnability metrics: Measures of how well models can extract useful representations; quick check: downstream task performance
- Band normalization: Scaling by frequency bandwidth; needed for comparison across different signal types

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Signal -> Husimi Transform -> Entropy Calculation -> ∆SB Measure -> Learnability Correlation
Critical path: Acquisition policy → signal → Husimi distribution → entropy → ∆SB → downstream performance prediction
Design tradeoffs: Computational complexity vs accuracy (full Husimi vs approximations), normalization methods, choice of entropy metric
Failure signatures: High ∆SB not correlating with poor learnability (suggests other factors dominate), computational intractability for high-dimensional signals, sensitivity to noise
First experiments: 1) Compare periodic vs random sampling entropy changes on simple signals, 2) Correlate ∆SB with MNIST classification accuracy under different acquisition masks, 3) Validate MIMO channel estimation performance prediction using entropy measure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond the limitations discussed in the limitations section.

## Limitations
- Limited validation on real-world noisy or adversarial conditions
- Assumes Husimi-based entropy captures all relevant structure for downstream tasks
- Relationship between |∆SB| and learnability lacks formal proof for arbitrary tasks
- Computational cost for high-dimensional signals not addressed

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Experimental demonstrations of periodic vs random sampling effects and ∆SB discrimination between sampling geometries
- Medium Confidence: Zero-training acquisition design capability requiring more diverse scenario validation
- Medium Confidence: Cross-domain learnability correlation needing theoretical guarantees

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on real-world noisy datasets (clinical MRI with motion artifacts, wireless channels with interference)
2. Evaluate ∆SB predictive power across different downstream architectures (GNNs, transformers)
3. Conduct ablation studies on Husimi components and test simplified approximations for computational efficiency
