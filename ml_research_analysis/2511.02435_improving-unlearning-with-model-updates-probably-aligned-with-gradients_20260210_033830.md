# Improving Unlearning with Model Updates Probably Aligned with Gradients

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02435
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02435
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Improves unlearning efficacy and efficiency compared to baselines using feasible updates based on gradient alignment probabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the machine unlearning problem by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem. The authors introduce feasible updates—parameter update directions that help with unlearning while preserving utility—based on masking and statistical guarantees from batch processing. The method involves selecting parameters to update using a focus vector derived from the probability that gradients agree on sign, incorporating estimation noise from batches. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN with VGG16 and ResNet18 show the approach improves unlearning efficacy and efficiency compared to baselines like SalUn and NGPlus, achieving lower membership inference attack scores and faster convergence to desired unlearning accuracy. The method can be plugged into existing first-order unlearning techniques.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to machine unlearning by introducing feasible updates, which are parameter update directions that simultaneously promote unlearning and preserve model utility. The key innovation is the use of a focus vector that identifies which parameters to update based on the probability that their gradients agree on sign across batches, incorporating estimation noise from batch processing. This focus vector is derived from statistical guarantees that certain update directions are more likely to be beneficial for unlearning. The method can be integrated with existing first-order unlearning techniques, making it a flexible addition to the unlearning toolbox. Experiments demonstrate improved performance on standard benchmarks compared to baseline methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves lower membership inference attack scores compared to SalUn and NGPlus baselines
- Demonstrates faster convergence to desired unlearning accuracy on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets
- Shows consistent improvements in unlearning efficacy while maintaining model utility across VGG16 and ResNet18 architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by identifying parameter updates that are probabilistically aligned with both unlearning and utility preservation goals. By calculating the probability that gradients agree on sign across batches, the approach identifies which parameters are most likely to contribute to effective unlearning when updated. This statistical approach accounts for estimation noise inherent in batch processing, providing a more robust selection of update directions. The focus vector acts as a filter that prioritizes parameters where gradient consensus is highest, ensuring that updates are both targeted and likely to be effective for removing specific data influences while maintaining overall model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input data -> Batch gradient computation -> Focus vector calculation -> Parameter selection -> Feasible update application -> Unlearning evaluation

**Critical path:** The critical computational path involves calculating batch gradients, computing the focus vector based on gradient sign agreement probabilities, selecting parameters based on the focus vector, and applying feasible updates. This path must be executed efficiently to make the method practical for large-scale models.

**Design tradeoffs:** The approach trades off between computational overhead (calculating focus vectors and probability distributions) and unlearning effectiveness. More sophisticated statistical analysis could improve unlearning but would increase computational cost. The method also assumes that gradient agreement is a reliable proxy for beneficial update directions, which may not hold in all scenarios.

**Failure signatures:** Poor unlearning performance may manifest as: (1) high membership inference scores indicating residual information about removed data, (2) significant utility degradation suggesting over-aggressive updates, or (3) slow convergence indicating ineffective parameter selection. The method may also fail when gradient landscapes are highly non-convex or when batch sizes are too small to provide reliable gradient estimates.

**First experiments:**
1. Implement focus vector calculation on a simple linear regression model with known gradients to verify the probability computation
2. Test parameter selection mechanism on a small CNN with CIFAR-10 subset to validate the update strategy
3. Compare membership inference scores before and after applying feasible updates on a pre-trained model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on empirical validation with specific architectures (VGG16, ResNet18) and datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN) raises questions about generalization to other domains and larger models
- Statistical guarantees for gradient agreement are based on batch processing assumptions that may not hold for highly non-convex loss landscapes common in deep learning
- Limited theoretical justification for the focus vector mechanism's effectiveness across diverse scenarios and data distributions

| Statistical analysis of gradient alignment | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the method across diverse architectures (Transformers, LSTMs) and domains (NLP, time-series) to assess generalizability beyond computer vision
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the focus vector mechanism versus the feasible update framework
3. Evaluate performance under varying data poisoning scenarios and noisy labels to test robustness of the gradient alignment approach
