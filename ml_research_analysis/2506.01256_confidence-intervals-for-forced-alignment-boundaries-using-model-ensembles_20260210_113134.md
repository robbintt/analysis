# Confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries using model ensembles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01256
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01256
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Neural network ensemble produces 97.85% confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries with width correlating to error magnitude

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for deriving confidence intervals for forced alignment boundaries using neural network ensemble techniques. The approach uses ten independently trained neural networks to perform alignment, then calculates the median boundary as the point estimate and uses order statistics to derive 97.85% confidence intervals. Tested on Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble method shows slight improvement over single-model alignment and provides uncertainty estimates that correlate with boundary error. The confidence intervals are output in both Praat TextGrids and JSON formats, offering researchers a tool to identify potential alignment errors and assess uncertainty in boundary placement.

## Method Summary
The method trains ten independent neural network models (3 LSTM layers with 128 units each) using 19.07 hours of training data from TIMIT and Buckeye corpora. Each model performs forced alignment on test utterances, producing boundary time estimates. For each boundary, the median of the ten estimates serves as the point estimate, while the 2nd lowest and 9th highest values form a 97.85% confidence interval using order statistics. The system outputs results in Praat TextGrid point tiers and JSON formats, with evaluation comparing ensemble performance against single-model baselines.

## Key Results
- Ensemble method shows slight improvement over single-model alignment in boundary error rates
- Confidence interval width correlates with boundary error magnitude, particularly for difficult transitions
- Vowel-vowel and similar acoustically ambiguous transitions show wider confidence intervals
- JSON format provides better programmatic access to confidence intervals than Praat point tiers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using the median of ensemble boundary estimates improves robustness against cascading alignment errors.
- Mechanism: Ten independently trained neural networks each produce boundary placements for the same utterance. The median of these placements serves as the point estimate, which is resistant to outliers compared to the mean. Forced aligners can produce extreme outliers from maladaptive acoustic model behaviors; the median naturally downweights these.
- Core assumption: The training process yields models that differ meaningfully from each other (via random initialization and stochastic training), creating a distribution of reasonable boundary estimates rather than identical outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble"
  - [section 3.2] "the median is robust to outliers. As a category, forced aligners can have extreme outliers from cascading errors"
  - [corpus] Related work on ensembles (Credal Ensemble Distillation) discusses uncertainty quantification benefits but in different domains; no direct corpus support for forced alignment specifically.
- Break condition: If all ten models converge to nearly identical predictions (low variance ensemble), confidence intervals become too narrow to be informative, though median still provides point estimate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Order statistics from a 10-model ensemble produce approximately 97.85% confidence intervals for boundary placement.
- Mechanism: After obtaining ten boundary time estimates for each segment boundary, sort them by value. The 2nd lowest and 9th highest values form the confidence interval bounds. This non-parametric approach requires no distributional assumptions and naturally handles asymmetric uncertainty.
- Core assumption: The ensemble boundaries can be treated as a sample of estimates drawn from some underlying distribution of plausible boundary placements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics"
  - [section 2.2] "using the 2nd and 9th ordered values... as the extremes will produce an approximately 97.85% confidence interval"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus connection; ensemble uncertainty work (SOMBRERO, Credal Ensemble) addresses boundary/uncertainty topics but not this specific order-statistics technique.
- Break condition: If the ensemble size changes (n ≠ 10), the order statistic indices must be recalculated for the desired confidence level.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Confidence interval width correlates with alignment difficulty and can serve as an error diagnostic.
- Mechanism: Segment transitions that are acoustically ambiguous (vowel-vowel, vowel-approximant, affricate-fricative) produce wider confidence intervals across the ensemble, reflecting genuine model uncertainty. Researchers can use wide intervals as flags for manual review.
- Core assumption: Model disagreement on boundary placement reflects genuine acoustic ambiguity rather than model failure alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "uncertainty estimates that correlate with boundary error"
  - [section 3.2, Figure 2] "sequences that are typically assumed to be difficult to segment do indeed show greater widths, indicating greater uncertainty"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus validation; this is an empirical finding specific to this paper.
- Break condition: Models can be confidently wrong—the interval may be narrow but the boundary incorrect if all models share a systematic bias.

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Order statistics for non-parametric confidence intervals
- Why needed here: Deriving confidence intervals without assuming normal distribution of boundary errors; the 2nd/9th of 10 ordered values gives ~97.85% CI.
- Quick check question: If you had 20 models instead of 10, which ordered values would you use for approximately 95% coverage?

### Concept: Forced alignment boundary derivation from probability sequences
- Why needed here: Understanding that boundaries represent the latest time point where current segment has higher cumulative probability than next segment, not simply where one phone probability exceeds another.
- Quick check question: Why does the paper specify "latest moment" rather than "first moment" where the next segment becomes more probable?

### Concept: Ensemble diversity requirements
- Why needed here: Recognizing that ensemble benefits require meaningful model variation; identical models provide no uncertainty information.
- Quick check question: What training variations create diversity across the ten models in this system?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Input features (MFCCs + deltas) -> 10 independent LSTM models -> Dynamic programming decoder -> Boundary extraction -> Ensemble aggregation (median + order statistics) -> Output formats (Praat TextGrid + JSON)

### Critical path
1. Extract MFCCs from audio → 2. Run all 10 models independently → 3. Decode each model's output against transcription → 4. Extract boundary time points from each decode → 5. For each boundary: sort 10 estimates, take median as point estimate, take 2nd/9th as CI bounds → 6. Write outputs

### Design tradeoffs
- Computational cost: 10× inference time increase; parallelizable but requires 10× memory for model weights
- Point tier vs interval tier: Paper uses Praat point tiers for CI representation, which cannot visually connect CI to specific segment boundaries—JSON format preferred for programmatic access
- Dictionary vs reference transcription: Dictionary-based alignment introduces ~5-8ms additional mean error due to pronunciation mismatches

### Failure signatures
- Very narrow CIs on grossly wrong boundaries indicate systematic ensemble bias
- Very wide CIs (>50ms) on clear segment transitions suggest training problems or feature extraction issues
- Missing/extra segments in dictionary-based alignment require DTW evaluation rather than direct boundary comparison

### First 3 experiments
1. Run single model vs ensemble on held-out test files; compare mean absolute boundary error to verify ensemble improvement
2. Calculate CI width distribution across segment transition types (vowel-vowel, stop-vowel, etc.) to validate that phonetically difficult transitions show wider intervals
3. Set a CI width threshold (e.g., >20ms) and measure precision/recall for identifying boundaries with error >20ms from ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the uncertainty and boundary placement of a neural network ensemble compare to the variation observed in an ensemble of human annotators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 7 states, "It may also prove useful to see how the ensemble of models compares with an ensemble of human annotators."
- Why unresolved: The current study evaluates the ensemble against a single "ground truth" transcription from corpora, which does not capture the variability inherent in human segmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the width of model-derived confidence intervals against the inter-annotator agreement ranges of multiple human labelers on the same speech data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Bayesian neural networks provide equivalent or superior uncertainty estimates for forced alignment without the computational cost of training multiple models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 8 suggests, "Future research should explore other techniques by which estimates of uncertainty for alignments could be derived. One such example might be using Bayesian neural networks..."
- Why unresolved: The proposed ensemble method requires approximately ten times the computational resources of a single model, creating a trade-off between uncertainty estimation and feasibility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing a forced aligner using a Bayesian neural network and comparing its boundary error rates and uncertainty calibration against the ensemble method on the TIMIT and Buckeye corpora.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does dynamically changing the alignment resolution after placing an initial boundary improve the definition of a plausible boundary region?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 8 cites an anonymous reviewer's suggestion to "dynamically change the alignment resolution after placing the initial boundary" to better identify plausible regions.
- Why unresolved: The current system uses a fixed linear interpolation method to place boundaries, which may not optimally reflect the acoustic probability landscape around the boundary.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the standard interpolation method against a multi-pass adaptive resolution method to see if the latter narrows confidence intervals without increasing error.

## Limitations

- Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer) are not specified, making exact replication difficult
- Extended CMU dictionary with custom proper nouns is not provided, though alternatives could be used
- Computational cost of 10× inference time creates practical limitations for large-scale deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- Median ensemble provides more robust point estimates than single models
- Order statistics from 10-model ensemble produce approximately 97.85% CIs
- CI width correlates with boundary error magnitude
- Vowel-vowel and similar transitions show wider CIs reflecting genuine uncertainty

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- Ensemble method shows slight improvement over single-model alignment (statistically significant but small effect size)
- JSON format is more suitable for programmatic CI access than Praat point tiers
- DTW evaluation is necessary when comparing dictionary vs reference transcriptions

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Specific computational cost estimates (10× inference time) - actual overhead depends on hardware and parallelization
- Exact CI width thresholds for error flagging - optimal thresholds not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical significance test**: Perform paired t-tests on boundary errors between single-model and ensemble alignments across all test utterances to confirm the reported "slight improvement" is statistically significant.

2. **CI calibration analysis**: For boundaries with known errors, calculate the actual coverage rate of the 97.85% CIs (percentage of times ground truth falls within the CI bounds) to validate the claimed confidence level.

3. **Ensemble size sensitivity**: Repeat the analysis with ensemble sizes of 5, 15, and 20 models to determine the optimal number needed for reliable uncertainty estimates and whether 10 models is the minimum effective size.
