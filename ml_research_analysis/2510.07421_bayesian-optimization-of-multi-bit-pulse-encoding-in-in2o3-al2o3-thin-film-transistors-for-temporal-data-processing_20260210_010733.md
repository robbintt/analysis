- Primary result: Bayesian optimization improved 6-bit pulse encoding nDoS from -55 to -8.97 in In2O3/Al2O3 TFTs

## Executive Summary
This work presents a Bayesian optimization framework to systematically optimize pulse encoding parameters for high-bit temporal data processing in solution-processed In2O3/Al2O3 thin-film transistors. The method addresses the challenge of maximizing state distinguishability across 64 possible 6-bit pulse sequences by exploring a five-dimensional parameter space including pulse period, base gate voltage, gate pulse amplitude, drain voltage, and duty cycle. The optimization significantly improves normalized degree of separation (nDoS) from log(nDoS) = -55 to -8.97, demonstrating enhanced computational performance in physical reservoir computing systems. The study also shows that a 4-bit optimization model can effectively guide 6-bit optimization, reducing experimental overhead while maintaining performance.

## Method Summary
The approach employs Gaussian Process Regression with Matern 5/2 kernel and Automatic Relevance Determination to model the relationship between five pulse parameters and the normalized degree of separation (nDoS). Bayesian optimization uses batch Upper Confidence Bound acquisition (q=5, β=1.0) to propose parameter sets for evaluation, starting from 20 Latin Hypercube samples and continuing for five optimization rounds. Each condition applies all 64 six-bit pulse sequences to the TFT, extracting final current values to compute nDoS relative to an ideal 6-bit separability threshold of 4.38×10^-114. A device reset protocol involving 300ms relaxation at base gate voltage followed by 3s negative bias stress ensures measurement repeatability between sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieved log(nDoS) = -8.97 for 6-bit encoding, representing a 46-fold improvement over initial conditions (log(nDoS) = -55)
- 4-bit optimization model successfully guided 6-bit optimization, with the best 4-bit condition achieving log(nDoS) = -9.23 when applied to 6-bit tasks
- SHAP analysis identified gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage as the most influential parameters for state distinguishability
- Demonstrated transferability of optimization results across different bit depths while maintaining computational performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging Bayesian optimization to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional parameter space of pulse encoding, systematically exploring trade-offs between pulse parameters to maximize state distinguishability. The Gaussian Process Regression model captures the complex, nonlinear relationships between pulse parameters and nDoS, enabling informed predictions about unexplored regions of the parameter space. The batch Upper Confidence Bound acquisition strategy balances exploration of uncertain regions with exploitation of promising areas, accelerating convergence to optimal conditions. The device reset protocol ensures measurement repeatability, preventing state drift from compromising the optimization process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Physical Reservoir Computing**: Why needed - Provides the computational framework for temporal data processing using material dynamics. Quick check - Verify the reservoir state updates follow the nonlinear dynamics equation.
- **Degree of Separation (DoS)**: Why needed - Quantifies the distinguishability between different pulse sequence outputs. Quick check - Confirm DoS calculation matches the provided equation using test current values.
- **Normalized DoS (nDoS)**: Why needed - Enables comparison across different bit depths by normalizing measured separability to ideal values. Quick check - Validate nDoS computation against the theoretical ideal values for 4-bit and 6-bit encodings.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Why needed - Efficiently explores high-dimensional parameter spaces with limited experimental resources. Quick check - Verify the acquisition function selects points that balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Why needed - Provides uncertainty quantification for predictions in unexplored parameter regions. Quick check - Confirm prediction uncertainty increases for regions far from training data.
- **Latin Hypercube Sampling**: Why needed - Ensures initial parameter space coverage for robust optimization starting points. Quick check - Verify initial samples span the full parameter ranges without clustering.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Physical TFT Reservoir -> Pulse Sequence Generator -> Current Measurement System -> Bayesian Optimization Engine -> Parameter Set Generator

### Critical Path
Parameter Set Generation -> Pulse Application -> Current Extraction -> nDoS Computation -> GPR Model Update -> Next Parameter Proposal

### Design Tradeoffs
- Batch size q=5 balances exploration speed against computational overhead
- Matern 5/2 kernel captures medium-length correlations while maintaining smoothness
- 3-second reset protocol ensures repeatability but adds latency
- 20 initial LHS samples provide broad coverage versus computational cost

### Failure Signatures
- Local optima trapping: Acquisition function consistently proposes similar parameter regions
- Poor model fit: Large discrepancies between predicted and measured nDoS values
- Device drift: Current values change between repeated measurements of identical sequences
- Convergence stalling: Minimal improvement in log(nDoS) across multiple optimization rounds

### First 3 Experiments
1. Verify baseline nDoS computation by applying identical pulse sequences and confirming consistent results
2. Test GPR model accuracy by comparing predictions to measurements for a held-out parameter set
3. Validate reset protocol effectiveness by measuring current stability across repeated baseline sequence applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can lower-bit models (e.g., 4-bit) effectively guide the optimization of encoding depths significantly beyond 6 bits (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit)?
- Can this Bayesian optimization framework improve state distinguishability in physical reservoirs with fundamentally different nonlinear dynamics, such as memristors or electrochemical transistors?
- Is the method compatible with high-speed, continuous processing given the required reset protocol between pulse sequences?

## Limitations
- Convergence criteria for Bayesian optimization rounds are not quantitatively defined
- Exact current measurement timing within pulse sequences is unspecified
- Statistical significance of near-identical performance between 4-bit and 6-bit optimized conditions is not established
- Reset protocol's effectiveness in fully restoring device state is assumed but not empirically validated

## Confidence
- High confidence: The Bayesian optimization framework implementation and its application to pulse parameter optimization are well-described and reproducible
- Medium confidence: The comparative performance between 4-bit-guided and 6-bit-optimized conditions, given the small performance difference (-9.23 vs -8.97)
- Low confidence: The quantitative impact of the reset protocol on measurement reproducibility due to lack of baseline current validation data

## Next Checks
1. Implement a quantitative convergence metric (e.g., improvement <1% over 2 consecutive rounds) and validate that the same optimal condition is identified
2. Systematically vary the current measurement timing within pulse sequences to quantify its impact on nDoS values
3. Perform repeated baseline current measurements before each pulse sequence to empirically verify the reset protocol's effectiveness in restoring device state
