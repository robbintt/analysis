# Multi-Plasticity Synergy with Adaptive Mechanism Assignment for Training Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.13673
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13673
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** Multi-plasticity framework achieves 99.52% MNIST, 97.22% DVS-Gesture accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a biologically inspired training framework for Spiking Neural Networks that integrates three distinct learning mechanisms (STBP, Hebbian learning, and SBP) through a learnable adaptive fusion system. The framework emulates neurotransmitter co-release by allowing these mechanisms to cooperatively modulate membrane potential updates while preserving their individual update dynamics. The approach significantly improves both accuracy and robustness across static and dynamic datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining inference-time efficiency.

## Method Summary
The method implements a LIF neuron architecture with three parallel weight sets ($W_1$, $W_2$, $W_3$) trained by different plasticity rules. During each timestep, membrane potential is computed using a weighted fusion of contributions from all three mechanisms, with learnable coefficients ($\lambda_i$) determining their relative influence. STBP updates $W_1$ via surrogate gradients, Hebbian learning updates $W_2$ locally based on spike correlations, and SBP updates $W_3$ using signals from Hebbian updates. After training, weights are merged into a single tensor for inference, maintaining deployment efficiency while benefiting from the multi-mechanism training phase.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.52% accuracy on MNIST and 97.22% on DVS-Gesture
- Outperforms single-mechanism approaches across all tested datasets
- Demonstrates superior robustness to Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise
- Shows better resilience to cropping perturbations compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Membrane Potential Co-Modulation via Parallel Plasticity Pathways
The framework enables multiple distinct learning mechanisms to simultaneously modulate the same membrane potential accumulation, providing richer representational dynamics than any single mechanism alone. Each mechanism preserves its independent update dynamics while their outputs fuse at the membrane potential level, capturing complementary features through weighted summation.

### Mechanism 2: Learnable Adaptive Fusion Coefficients
Learnable scalar parameters ($\lambda_i$) per mechanism are jointly optimized with network weights, enabling task-adaptive balancing that outperforms fixed weighting schemes. This allows the network to discover optimal mechanism combinations for specific datasets and training phases, rather than relying on static coefficients.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Mechanism Signal Reuse for Guided Plasticity
Global error signals from STBP guide optimization of local Hebbian and SBP parameters, while SBP reuses Hebbian weight changes as its learning signal. This creates beneficial interdependence between mechanisms without collapsing into a single learning rule, improving convergence and stability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Dynamics**
  - Why needed: The entire framework operates on membrane potential updates within LIF neurons. Understanding $U^{t,l} = \rho_m(U^{t-1,l} - S^{t-1,l}V_{th}) + I^{t,l}$ is essential for interpreting multi-mechanism fusion.
  - Quick check: If membrane decay $\rho_m = 0.5$ and no spike occurs, what happens to $U$ at the next timestep?

- **Surrogate Gradient Method**
  - Why needed: STBP relies on replacing the non-differentiable spike function derivative with a rectangular surrogate. Understanding this approximation is crucial for debugging gradient flow.
  - Quick check: Why can't standard backpropagation be directly applied to the spike function $\Theta(U - V_{th})$?

- **Hebbian Learning Principle**
  - Why needed: One of three core mechanisms implementing correlation-driven local plasticity without global labels. Understanding the weight update $W_2^{t,l} = W_2^{t-1,l}e^{-dt/\tau_w} + \eta_l S^{t,l-1}(\rho(U^{t,l}) + \beta_l)$ is essential.
  - Quick check: In pure Hebbian learning without decay or normalization, what happens to weights over time?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input → Spiking Encoders (layers 1 to N) → Each layer has 3 parallel weight tensors $W_1^l, W_2^l, W_3^l$ → Membrane potential $U^{t,l}$ computed via Eq. 3 with fused input current from Eq. 5 → Three plasticity modules (STBP for $W_1$, Hebbian for $W_2$, SBP for $W_3$) → Fusion layer with $\lambda_i$ parameters → Inference-time merge: $W^l = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i W_i^l$

- **Critical path:** Forward pass accumulates membrane potential using fused inputs (Eq. 5) → Within timesteps, Hebbian $W_2$ updates occur immediately after spike computation → Backward pass computes STBP gradients for $W_1$ and all $\lambda_i$ → SBP $W_3$ updates use Hebbian $\Delta W_2$ → After training, merge weights for inference

- **Design tradeoffs:** Training memory vs. inference efficiency (3x weight tensors during training, 1x for inference) → Flexibility vs. complexity (more mechanisms = more hyperparameters) → Biological plausibility vs. optimization power (STBP less biologically plausible but provides strong gradients)

- **Failure signatures:** $\lambda_i$ collapse (all weight assigned to one mechanism → reverts to single-mechanism performance) → Divergent Hebbian weights (if $\eta_l$ too high or $\tau_w$ too low, $W_2$ grows unbounded) → SBP signal degradation (if Hebbian updates are too small/noisy, SBP's reused signal provides no useful learning)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train on MNIST with all three mechanisms, compare against ablated versions (remove one mechanism at a time) to verify each contributes to final accuracy
  2. Compare learnable $\lambda_i$ vs. fixed equal weights vs. hand-tuned weights on Fashion-MNIST to confirm adaptive fusion provides measurable gain
  3. Evaluate trained model on Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise at multiple levels, compare degradation curve against STBP-only baseline to validate robustness claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the MPSL framework scale effectively to ImageNet-level complexity and deep residual architectures?
- **Basis in paper:** The evaluation is restricted to relatively small datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, DVS-Gesture) and shallow CNNs.
- **Why unresolved:** The training phase requires storing three separate weight matrices ($W_1, W_2, W_3$), creating a $3\times$ memory overhead that may limit deep network feasibility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance and memory benchmarks on ImageNet using deep Spiking ResNets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the framework integrate learning rules with conflicting optimization trajectories without destabilization?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors claim "architectural generality" but validate only three specific mechanisms (STBP, Hebbian, SBP).
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the learnable fusion parameter is sufficient to mitigate conflicts between rules with opposing gradient directions or timescales.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments combining antagonistic plasticity rules (e.g., heterosynaptic vs. Hebbian) to test stability.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Do the learnable fusion coefficients ($\lambda$) converge to stable equilibria or adapt dynamically to input statistics?
- **Basis in paper:** The ablation study demonstrates the superiority of learnable coefficients but does not visualize their temporal behavior.
- **Why unresolved:** Understanding $\lambda$ dynamics is crucial for distinguishing between a static weighted average and a continuously adaptive gating mechanism.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Visualization of $\lambda$ trajectories over training epochs and analysis of their correlation with input complexity.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks explicit specification of global optimizer type and learning rates for weight and parameter updates, which are critical for reproducibility.
- No details provided on parameter initialization strategies for weights or learnable modulation coefficients.
- Cross-mechanism signal reuse (SBP using Hebbian updates) is proposed but not empirically validated for its contribution versus potential instability.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** MNIST (99.52%) and DVS-Gesture (97.22%) accuracy results; ablation study showing learnable fusion coefficients outperform fixed weights
- **Medium Confidence:** CIFAR-10 results (89.44%) and robustness claims against noise/cropping; mechanism interaction benefits lack direct empirical separation
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability beyond tested datasets; long-term stability of learnable learning rates in Hebbian rule; biological plausibility of the full multi-plasticity framework

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation studies isolating each mechanism's contribution on Fashion-MNIST to verify claimed synergy
2. Test model stability under varying learning rates for both global optimizer and learnable coefficients to identify potential divergence conditions
3. Evaluate performance degradation curves under Gaussian noise and salt-and-pepper noise at multiple intensity levels to validate robustness claims against single-mechanism baselines
