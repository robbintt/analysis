# Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10825
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825
- Authors: Anindya Bijoy Das; Shahnewaz Karim Sakib
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LLM-based recommendations exhibit significant demographic, cultural, and contextual biases, but prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation can effectively mitigate these disparities.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates bias in LLM-based recommendation systems for music, movies, and books across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, Gemini). The study reveals that demographic descriptors, cultural contexts, and intersecting identities amplify bias in recommendations, with certain genres disproportionately suggested to specific groups. The authors propose and validate two mitigation strategies—prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation—which significantly reduce bias metrics (SPD, EOD, DI) across fairness-related questions. The work demonstrates that even simple interventions can address deeply ingrained biases in LLM recommendations.

## Method Summary
The study systematically generates recommendations using context-less (CLG) and context-based (CBG) prompts across diverse demographic descriptors. Recommendations are classified into genres using a GPT-based classifier, and bias is quantified using statistical metrics (SPD, DI, EOD, JSD). Mitigation strategies include fairness-aware prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a curated neutral knowledge base. The process involves: (1) generating recommendations for varied demographic and contextual prompts, (2) classifying items into genres, (3) computing fairness metrics, and (4) applying and evaluating mitigation strategies.

## Key Results
- Demographic biases: Females receive more romance movies, while North Americans are suggested more sci-fi content.
- Contextual amplification: Socioeconomic and personality contexts amplify biases (e.g., affluent individuals receive more sci-fi).
- Mitigation effectiveness: Prompt engineering and RAG significantly reduce bias metrics (SPD, DI, EOD) across fairness-related questions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Demographic and cultural bias in LLM recommendations stems from skewed training data that over-represents mainstream content.
- Mechanism: Training corpora disproportionately feature Western, mainstream, and majority-group content. The model learns statistical associations between demographic descriptors and specific content genres during pretraining. At inference, demographic cues in prompts activate these learned associations, yielding skewed genre distributions (e.g., females receive more romance movies, North Americans more sci-fi).
- Core assumption: The model's learned representations directly influence recommendation outputs in a predictable, patternable way.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options."
  - [section] Figure 4 and related text show gender-based (romance vs. thriller), age-based (hip-hop vs. blues), and occupation-based (fiction vs. biography) disparities.
  - [corpus] Limited direct corpus support; neighbor papers address gender/cultural bias but do not confirm the specific training-data skew mechanism for this dataset.
- Break condition: If the training data were balanced across groups, or if the model were explicitly debiased during pretraining/finetuning, this mechanism would weaken or break.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding contextual information can amplify existing biases by providing additional signal correlated with stereotypical patterns in training data.
- Mechanism: Contexts such as socioeconomic status, personality, or residence provide extra conditioning that the model uses to retrieve associated patterns. If these patterns are skewed in training (e.g., affluent associated with sci-fi, impoverished with drama), recommendations become more stereotypical than in context-less prompts.
- Core assumption: Contextual attributes are non-uniformly represented and correlated with specific content in the training corpus.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section IV-B and Figure 10 show that affluent individuals receive more sci-fi/fantasy, while impoverished individuals receive more drama/biographies; introverts get more blues/classical, extroverts more hip-hop.
  - [abstract] "Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases."
  - [corpus] Related works confirm context-dependent bias amplification in recommendation systems but do not validate this exact mechanism for these models.
- Break condition: If contextual factors were decorrelated from content preferences in training data, or if prompts explicitly instructed the model to ignore stereotypical associations, amplification would reduce.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a neutrally curated knowledge base reduces bias by grounding responses in explicitly balanced content.
- Mechanism: A curated list of 200 items per domain (movies, songs, books), selected for cultural and demographic neutrality, is queried to retrieve the top-10 contextually relevant items. These items are injected into the prompt, providing a balanced informational framework that constrains the model's generation away from its internal biased representations.
- Core assumption: The curated list is sufficiently neutral and diverse, and the retrieval step reliably surfaces relevant items without introducing new bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] Section V-B and Figure 15 show reduced Jensen-Shannon divergence post-RAG. Table I reports SPD reductions, e.g., from 0.90 to 0.16 for historical fiction recommendations.
  - [abstract] "We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively."
  - [corpus] Neighbor papers mention RAG for fairness but do not validate the neutrality of the curated list for these specific domains.
- Break condition: If the "neutral" knowledge base contains residual biases, or if the retrieval model prioritizes popularity over diversity, the mechanism could fail or partially backfire.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fairness metrics (SPD, DI, EOD):**
  - Why needed here: These quantify group-level disparities in recommendations; the paper uses them to measure bias before and after mitigation.
  - Quick check question: Given two groups with different rates of receiving a "favorable" recommendation, which metric directly measures the difference in those rates?

- **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD):**
  - Why needed here: JSD quantifies dissimilarity between genre distributions across demographic groups, enabling comparison of bias severity.
  - Quick check question: Why is JSD preferred over Kullback-Leibler divergence when comparing distributions symmetrically?

- **Context-less vs. Context-based Generation (CLG vs. CBG):**
  - Why needed here: The paper systematically compares bias when prompts lack context (CLG) versus include socioeconomic, personality, or residence cues (CBG).
  - Quick check question: Which framework is more likely to surface implicit intersectional biases, and why?

- **Normalized Fraction:**
  - Why needed here: This metric measures the proportion of recommendations in a specific genre going to one group relative to all groups, enabling cross-group comparisons.
  - Quick check question: If 30 students, 20 musicians, and 10 athletes receive 60, 50, and 30 rock recommendations respectively, what is the normalized fraction for musicians?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** LLM (GPT, LLaMA, Gemini) -> Prompt template (CLG or CBG) -> Raw recommendations -> Genre classifier (GPT-based) -> Genre distribution per group -> Fairness metric computation (SPD, DI, EOD, JSD). Mitigation branches: fairness-aware prompt engineering or RAG with neutral knowledge base.

- **Critical path:** (1) Design diverse, demographically varied prompts; (2) Generate recommendations consistently across groups; (3) Classify recommendations into genres reliably; (4) Compute and interpret fairness metrics; (5) Implement and validate mitigation strategies.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Using GPT as genre classifier trades scalability and consistency for potential annotation bias vs. human labeling. The choice of three contexts (personality, area, SES) balances coverage with experimental tractability. RAG's curated list size (200 items) trades neutrality curation effort against retrieval diversity.

- **Failure signatures:** Classifier accuracy >90% in distinguishing groups based solely on recommendations (Table I); SPD or EOD approaching 1.0; DI near 0; high JSD between groups indicating divergent distributions.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run CLG prompts across gender/age/occupation combinations, compute normalized fractions and JSD to quantify baseline demographic bias.
  2. Extend to CBG with personality, area, and SES contexts; compare metrics to CLG to measure context-driven amplification or mitigation.
  3. Apply prompt-engineering and RAG mitigation; recompute SPD, DI, EOD, and JSD to quantify improvement and identify edge cases where metrics degrade.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the proposed bias mitigation strategies (prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation) impact the accuracy and utility of the recommendation system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "investigating the accuracy-fairness trade-off is crucial to ensure effective and equitable AI systems."
- Why unresolved: The paper quantifies improvements in fairness metrics (SPD, DI, EOD) but does not measure potential degradation in recommendation relevance or quality (e.g., using metrics like precision or NDCG) caused by the interventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A simultaneous evaluation of both fairness metrics and standard recommendation accuracy metrics (such as Hit Rate or NDCG) on the same dataset before and after applying the mitigation strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational overhead and scalability of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy for real-time, large-scale recommendation applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the computational overhead associated with the RAG-approach require careful consideration" and explicitly call for future work to "explore the scalability of these strategies."
- Why unresolved: The study validates RAG on a curated list of 200 items for experimental prompts but does not assess the latency or resource costs required to maintain and query a knowledge base in a production environment with millions of items.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks measuring inference latency, memory usage, and retrieval time for the RAG pipeline when scaled to a standard industry-sized item corpus.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the reliance on LLMs (specifically GPT) as proxy annotators for genre classification introduce systematic errors that affect the fairness evaluation results?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section III-B states, "we use GPT as a proxy annotator for genre labeling," while admitting that "LLM-based classifiers may reflect training-data biases and genre ambiguity."
- Why unresolved: The fairness analysis depends entirely on these genre labels. If the annotating model has a bias against classifying niche or non-Western genres correctly, the measured "unfairness" or "bias" in the recommendation models could be an artifact of the annotation process rather than the recommender itself.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validation study comparing the LLM-generated genre labels against a human-annotated ground truth dataset to determine if classification errors correlate with specific demographic or cultural descriptors.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do bias mitigation strategies perform when applied to non-binary gender identities and more granular intersectional demographics (e.g., specific ethnicities combined with age)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion acknowledges the study "focused on binary gender groups and limited demographic factors" and suggests future research "explore fairness across a broader range of racial, ethnic, and socio-economic groups."
- Why unresolved: The current experimental design relies on binary gender descriptors (Male/Female) and broad cultural regions; therefore, the effectiveness of prompt engineering or RAG for non-binary users or highly specific intersectional identities remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the prompt datasets to include non-binary gender options and finer-grained racial/ethnic descriptors, followed by re-evaluation of the fairness metrics (SPD, DI, EOD) for these new groups.

## Limitations
- Reliance on GPT-based genre classification may introduce systematic labeling biases.
- Neutrality of the curated RAG knowledge base is not independently validated.
- Fixed demographic descriptors may not capture intersectional nuances beyond tested combinations.

## Confidence
- **High**: SPD, DI, EOD metric reductions post-mitigation; classifier accuracy >90% in distinguishing groups
- **Medium**: JSD-based bias quantification; demographic group disparities
- **Low**: Neutrality of curated RAG knowledge base; robustness of genre classification system

## Next Checks
1. Replicate bias quantification using human-annotated genre labels on a random 10% sample to validate GPT classifier accuracy
2. Test RAG mitigation with multiple curated knowledge bases of varying demographic balance to assess dependency on assumed neutrality
3. Run 5-generation Monte Carlo simulation per prompt to measure variance in fairness metrics and classifier distinguishability
