# Optimizing Tensor Train Decomposition in DNNs for RISC-V Architectures Using Design Space Exploration and Compiler Optimizations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01996
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01996
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a design space exploration methodology for optimizing fully connected layers in deep neural networks using tensor train decomposition on RISC-V architectures

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for optimizing tensor train (TT) decomposition in fully connected layers of deep neural networks (DNNs) on RISC-V architectures. The approach combines three key techniques: pruning the design space based on FLOPs/memory trade-offs using shape alignment, applying heuristics to remove inefficient inference solutions, and leveraging compiler optimizations to enhance T3F layers' performance on RISC-V processors. The methodology demonstrates significant improvements in both search efficiency and inference performance, addressing the unique challenges of implementing TT decomposition on resource-constrained RISC-V architectures.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology employs a three-pronged approach to optimize TT decomposition for DNNs on RISC-V architectures. First, it prunes the design space by analyzing FLOPs and memory trade-offs through shape alignment, eliminating suboptimal configurations early in the process. Second, it applies heuristics to identify and remove inefficient inference solutions that would not meet performance requirements. Finally, it implements compiler optimizations specifically tailored for T3F (Tensor Train Format) layers on RISC-V processors. This systematic approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining model accuracy, making it particularly suitable for edge devices and resource-constrained environments where RISC-V architectures are increasingly deployed.

## Key Results
- Design space reduction of up to 92x through pruning and heuristic elimination
- 3x faster inference compared to IREE and 8x faster than Pluto for the same compressed models
- End-to-end speedups averaging 12x compared to uncompressed models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of this approach stems from its systematic elimination of suboptimal design configurations combined with targeted compiler optimizations. By leveraging shape alignment to identify and remove inefficient solutions early in the design process, the methodology significantly reduces the search space while preserving high-performance configurations. The compiler optimizations are specifically tailored to the characteristics of TT decomposition and the architectural features of RISC-V processors, enabling more efficient execution of tensor operations. This dual approach of intelligent pruning and architecture-specific optimization creates a synergistic effect that maximizes both search efficiency and inference performance.

## Foundational Learning
- Tensor Train (TT) decomposition: A tensor factorization technique that represents high-dimensional tensors in a compressed format; needed to understand the core optimization target and its computational characteristics
- RISC-V architecture: An open-source, modular processor architecture; needed to comprehend the optimization targets and constraints specific to this platform
- Design Space Exploration (DSE): The systematic evaluation of design alternatives to identify optimal configurations; needed to understand the methodology for navigating the vast space of possible TT decompositions
- T3F (Tensor Train Format): The specific implementation format for TT decomposition used in this work; needed to understand the data structures and operations being optimized
- FLOPs/Memory trade-offs: The balance between computational operations and memory usage; needed to understand the optimization criteria used for design space pruning
- Shape alignment: A technique for optimizing tensor operations by aligning tensor dimensions; needed to understand how the methodology identifies and eliminates inefficient configurations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
User -> Dataset/Architecture Selection -> Design Space Generation -> Pruning & Heuristics -> Compiler Optimization -> Optimized Model

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from design space generation through pruning and heuristic elimination to compiler optimization. The most time-consuming steps are typically the initial design space generation and the pruning process, as these involve evaluating numerous configurations. The compiler optimization phase, while crucial for final performance, generally has less impact on the overall optimization timeline.

Design Tradeoffs:
The primary tradeoff involves balancing search space reduction against the risk of eliminating potentially optimal solutions. Aggressive pruning may miss some high-performance configurations but significantly reduces computation time. Conversely, conservative pruning preserves more options but increases search time. The methodology must also balance the computational overhead of design space exploration against the performance gains achieved through optimization.

Failure Signatures:
Common failure modes include over-aggressive pruning that eliminates viable solutions, inadequate consideration of RISC-V-specific constraints leading to suboptimal compiler optimizations, and insufficient validation of pruned solutions against accuracy requirements. Failures in the pruning phase may result in missing optimal configurations, while failures in compiler optimization may lead to inefficient execution despite good design choices.

First Experiments:
1. Baseline evaluation: Implement and benchmark standard TT decomposition on RISC-V without optimization to establish performance baselines
2. Design space pruning validation: Test the pruning methodology on a small, controlled design space to verify its effectiveness and accuracy preservation
3. Compiler optimization isolation: Implement and benchmark individual compiler optimizations to understand their isolated impact on performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focus on fully connected layers only, without addressing convolutional layers which are more prevalent in modern DNNs
- Evaluation limited to synthetic and MNIST datasets, raising questions about generalizability to larger, real-world models
- Comparison framework focuses on specific optimization methods (IREE and Pluto) without broader benchmarking against other state-of-the-art approaches

## Confidence
- Design space pruning effectiveness: Medium confidence (results show significant reduction but limited dataset diversity)
- Compiler optimization improvements: Medium confidence (RISC-V specific results but limited architecture diversity)
- End-to-end speedups: Medium confidence (synthetic/MNIST results may not scale to larger models)

## Next Checks
1. Testing on larger, real-world datasets and more complex DNN architectures to validate scalability
2. Evaluating the approach on different RISC-V implementations to assess architecture portability
3. Benchmarking against a broader range of optimization frameworks and techniques to establish relative performance
