# Multiplayer Information Asymmetric Bandits in Metric Spaces
## Quick Facts

- Extends Lipschitz multiplayer bandits to metric spaces with information asymmetry

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses multiplayer bandits with information asymmetry in metric spaces, where players may not observe each other's actions, rewards, or both. The authors extend algorithms from finite-armed bandits to continuous spaces using uniform discretization and adaptive discretization via the zooming algorithm. Three problem settings are considered: asymmetry in actions, rewards, and both. Theoretical regret bounds are derived for each setting, showing that information asymmetry can be partially mitigated through algorithmic design.

## Method Summary
The paper extends existing Lipschitz bandit algorithms to metric spaces with information asymmetry. For problems with asymmetry in actions or rewards, uniform discretization is combined with the zooming algorithm. When asymmetry exists in both actions and rewards, the authors develop a modified approach. The zooming algorithm with adaptive discretization provides improved bounds by dynamically adjusting the discretization level based on observed rewards. The theoretical analysis carefully accounts for the communication constraints imposed by information asymmetry.

## Key Results
- For action or reward asymmetry: regret bound of $O\left(T^{\frac{2Md+1}{2Md+2}}L^{\frac{Md}{Md+1}}(\log T)^{\frac{1}{2(Md+1)}}\right)$
- For both action and reward asymmetry: near-optimal bound of $O\left(T^{\frac{2Md+1}{2Md+2}}L^{\frac{Md}{Md+1}}(\log T)^{\frac{1}{Md+1}}\right)$
- Zooming algorithm with adaptive discretization achieves $O\left(T^{\frac{Md+1}{Md+2}}(c\log T)^{\frac{1}{Md+2}}\right)$

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by leveraging the Lipschitz continuity of reward functions to enable effective exploration in continuous spaces. The zooming algorithm adapts discretization based on observed rewards, focusing computational resources on promising regions. Information asymmetry is handled by carefully designing communication protocols that respect the constraints while still enabling coordination. The uniform discretization approach provides a baseline that matches single-player bounds when asymmetry is limited to actions or rewards.

## Foundational Learning
- **Lipschitz continuity**: Smoothness assumption on reward functions; needed for generalization across the metric space; check by verifying reward function satisfies Lipschitz condition
- **Metric spaces**: Generalization beyond Euclidean spaces; needed for broader applicability; check by confirming distance function satisfies metric properties
- **Information asymmetry**: Players have different information about actions/rewards; needed to model realistic communication constraints; check by verifying which information channels are available
- **Uniform discretization**: Partitioning continuous space into finite grid; needed for extending finite-armed algorithms; check by ensuring grid resolution is appropriate
- **Zooming algorithm**: Adaptive discretization based on observed rewards; needed to reduce computational complexity; check by monitoring discretization level changes

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Metric space -> Discretization module -> Action selection -> Reward observation -> Update module
- **Critical path**: Discretization of space → Action selection based on exploration/exploitation → Reward observation and sharing (if possible) → Update of estimated values and discretization
- **Design tradeoffs**: Uniform discretization provides simpler implementation but suffers from curse of dimensionality; zooming algorithm is more complex but adapts to problem structure
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance with high-dimensional spaces using uniform discretization; communication overhead in partial observation settings; sensitivity to Lipschitz constant estimation
- **First experiments**: 1) Test algorithm with known Lipschitz constant on synthetic smooth functions 2) Evaluate zooming algorithm's adaptive behavior on varying reward landscapes 3) Compare uniform vs adaptive discretization on high-dimensional problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes known Lipschitz constant L, which may not be available in practice
- Curse of dimensionality affects uniform discretization approach in high-dimensional spaces
- No empirical validation of theoretical bounds provided
- Limited discussion of computational overhead for the zooming algorithm

## Confidence
- Theoretical bounds and proofs: High confidence
- Extension of finite-armed algorithms to metric spaces: Medium confidence
- Comparison to single-player bounds: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Implement the algorithms with varying dimensionalities to empirically verify the dependence on d and test the curse of dimensionality effects
2. Conduct experiments comparing the zooming algorithm's adaptive discretization versus uniform discretization in terms of both regret and computational efficiency
3. Evaluate algorithm performance under partial knowledge scenarios where the Lipschitz constant L is unknown or must be estimated online
