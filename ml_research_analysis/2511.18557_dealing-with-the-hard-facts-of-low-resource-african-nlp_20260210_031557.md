# Dealing with the Hard Facts of Low-Resource African NLP

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.18557
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18557
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: 612 hours of spontaneous Bambara speech collected, 423 hours high-quality segments, achieving up to 37% WER reduction with ultra-compact (114M) and small (600M) ASR models

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to developing Bambara automatic speech recognition systems in a low-resource setting. The authors collected 612 hours of spontaneous speech through facilitated recordings, processed 423 hours of high-quality segments, and developed a semi-automated transcription pipeline. Their work demonstrates that iterative human-model-in-the-loop annotation can achieve 112% improvement in annotation throughput while producing high-quality training data. The resulting ultra-compact (114M) and small (600M) monolingual models show significant WER reductions on in-domain data, though human evaluation reveals systematic gaps between automatic metrics and native speaker judgments.

## Method Summary
The method involves collecting Bambara speech through mobile app recordings with trained facilitators, preprocessing with Silero VAD for segmentation and SNR estimation, and implementing a semi-automated transcription pipeline using pre-trained ASR models followed by human correction. Two models were fine-tuned: soloni-114m (Fast-Conformer encoder with hybrid CTC/TDT decoders) and QuartzNet (18M parameters). Training used NVIDIA NeMo toolkit with specific hyperparameters on 4 A100 GPUs. The soloni-114m model was trained for 110k steps then 100k steps with bf16 precision, while QuartzNet used 65k steps with Novograd optimizer.

## Key Results
- Iterative human-model-in-the-loop annotation achieved 112% improvement in annotation throughput (17× real-time factor)
- CTC outperformed TDT at 30h training data; TDT surpassed CTC at 98h with 28.58% vs 29.05% WER on in-domain test
- Human evaluation revealed systematic gaps between automatic metrics and native speaker judgments, especially for disfluencies and proper names
- Ultra-compact (114M) and small (600M) models achieved up to 37% WER reduction on in-domain data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Iterative human-model-in-the-loop annotation accelerates transcription throughput while improving subsequent model quality.
- Mechanism: Pre-transcription with an initial model (soloni-v0) reduces human annotator workload; corrected outputs finetune a second model (soloni-v2), which then generates higher-quality pre-transcriptions for remaining data. This yielded a 112% improvement in annotation throughput (from 36× to 17× real-time factor).
- Core assumption: Error patterns in model outputs are sufficiently consistent that human correctors can validate faster than transcribing from scratch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Human reviewers corrected and validated the transcriptions, enabling rapid production at a 17× real-time factor."
  - [Section 5.2] "Using soloni-v2 instead of soloni-v0 yielded a 112% improvement in the rate at which human-corrected transcriptions could be produced."
  - [corpus] Related work (NaijaVoices, arXiv:2505.20564) similarly emphasizes facilitated collection but does not report comparable iterative annotation speedups.
- Break condition: If pre-transcription error rates exceed ~50% WER, correction time may approach de novo transcription time, negating speed gains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hybrid CTC/TDT dual-decoder training provides complementary supervision signals that improve robustness across data regimes.
- Mechanism: The soloni-114m model jointly trains a Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT, autoregressive) and a CTC decoder (non-autoregressive) with shared encoder. At smaller data scales (30h), CTC outperformed TDT; at 98h, TDT surpassed CTC on in-domain test (28.58% vs 29.05% WER).
- Core assumption: Shared encoder benefits from diverse gradient signals, and decoder choice can be data-dependent at inference time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 4] "soloni-114m-tdt-ctc-v0 uses a Fast-Conformer encoder and a hybrid decoding setup with two independent but jointly trained decoders."
  - [Section 5.1] "The CTC branch lost its edge over TDT when we increased training data from 30h to 98h, confirming that autoregressive architectures outperform non-autoregressive ones when we scale training data."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison for CTC/TDT hybrid architectures in low-resource African ASR was found.
- Break condition: If training data is highly variable or poorly normalized, joint optimization may introduce conflicting gradient signals, degrading both decoders.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Intentional dataset simplification (noise reduction, code-switching suppression) improves baseline model quality at the cost of real-world robustness.
- Mechanism: Collection guidelines emphasized clean recording environments and minimized French code-switching. Result: 71.75% of recordings in "High" or "Very High" SNR categories, enabling strong in-domain performance but reduced out-of-domain robustness.
- Core assumption: A clean, homogeneous corpus provides a stable foundation before tackling noisier, code-switched data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Section 3.1] "The objective was to gather homogeneous data that would simplify training and provide a baseline."
  - [Section 6/7] "Models trained exclusively on this corpus may exhibit a noticeable drop in performance when deployed in real world contexts with inherent noise, fluent code-switching, and diverse accents."
  - [corpus] WAXAL (arXiv:2602.02734) and Swivuriso (arXiv:2512.02201) report similar collection protocols emphasizing domain-focused, facilitated recording.
- Break condition: If deployment contexts diverge significantly (urban noise, heavy code-switching), domain adaptation or augmented training data becomes necessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
  - Why needed here: Silero VAD segments raw recordings into speech chunks (0.24–30s), removing silence and inaudible regions before transcription.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why VAD-based SNR estimation better reflects ASR difficulty than whole-waveform SNR?

- Concept: **CTC vs Autoregressive Decoding**
  - Why needed here: The paper compares CTC (non-autoregressive) and TDT (autoregressive) decoders, showing their relative performance shifts with data scale.
  - Quick check question: Why might an autoregressive decoder outperform CTC given sufficient training data?

- Concept: **WER/CER Limitations for Oral Languages**
  - Why needed here: Human evaluation revealed systematic gaps between automatic metrics and native speaker judgments, especially for disfluencies and proper names.
  - Quick check question: What types of errors might yield low WER but poor human acceptability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection -> VAD preprocessing -> Pre-transcription -> Human correction -> Model finetuning -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Recording quality (SNR, facilitator training) determines downstream annotation efficiency
  2. VAD segmentation quality affects segment duration distribution and transcription granularity
  3. Pre-transcription accuracy governs human correction throughput
  4. Finetuning data quality (human-corrected) drives final model performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Clean vs realistic data: Homogeneous collection simplifies training but limits real-world robustness
  - Model size vs deployment: QuartzNet (18M) enables offline mobile use; soloni (114M) achieves better WER
  - CTC vs TDT decoding: CTC faster at inference; TDT better with more data
  - Code-switching handling: `[cs]` tag simplifies vocabulary but sacrifices linguistic realism

- Failure signatures:
  - High WER on proper names, disfluencies, overlapping speech (Section 5.2)
  - Performance drop on Nyana Eval (noisier, multi-speaker) vs Afvoices Test
  - Human evaluators rating models lower despite better WER (soloni-v2 vs soloni-v1)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline finetuning**: Finetune soloni-114m on 98h human-corrected data; evaluate CTC and TDT decoders separately on Afvoices Test and Nyana Eval.
  2. **Ablation on segment duration**: Filter out segments <1s; measure impact on WER/CER and training convergence.
  3. **Domain shift probe**: Train on ANV data; test on held-out jeli-asr street interviews to quantify clean-to-noisy generalization gap.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can automatic evaluation metrics be modified or weighted to better correlate with native speaker judgments on disfluencies and code-switching in Bambara ASR?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors state "automatic metrics do not always align with native speaker judgments, especially on disfluencies and code-switching"; soloni-v2 achieved better WER but was judged less robust than soloni-v1.
- Why unresolved: Paper documents the misalignment but proposes no alternative metrics or corrections.
- What evidence would resolve it: New metrics validated against large-scale human evaluation showing improved correlation over standard WER/CER.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What domain adaptation techniques most effectively transfer clean-data Bambara ASR models to real-world noisy environments with natural code-switching?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Limitations section states models "may exhibit a noticeable drop in performance when deployed in the real world" and practitioners "must anticipate the need for a targeted domain adaptation."
- Why unresolved: Paper intentionally collected controlled data; no adaptation experiments conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of adaptation strategies (augmentation, mixed-domain fine-tuning) on authentic Malian deployment data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How well does this Bambara ASR pipeline transfer zero-shot or with minimal data to mutually intelligible Manding languages (Malinke, Dioula, Mandinka)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Conclusion states "Future work will extend this approach to other Manding languages" with 40M potential speakers across these languages.
- Why unresolved: Transfer experiments not yet conducted despite linguistic proximity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Zero-shot and few-shot evaluation on test sets from each related language with error analysis.

## Limitations
- Clean, homogeneous data collection prioritizes annotation efficiency over ecological validity, limiting generalization to real-world deployment contexts
- 98-hour training set remains modest compared to high-resource languages, with performance degrading notably on challenging benchmarks
- Systematic gaps between automatic metrics and native speaker judgments, especially for disfluencies and proper names, suggest current evaluation protocols may not capture deployment-relevant quality

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Iterative human-model-in-the-loop annotation throughput improvements (112% speedup with soloni-v2), dataset characteristics (612h collected, 423h high-quality segments, VAD-based SNR distribution), and baseline model performance on in-domain Afvoices Test (CTC outperforming TDT at 30h, TDT outperforming CTC at 98h).
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about model robustness on Nyana Eval (38.07% WER for soloni-114m vs 53.34% for Parakeet base) and QuartzNet deployment suitability (18M parameters, 1.3% WER on Afvoices Test), given the dataset's homogeneous nature and limited environmental variability.
- **Low confidence**: Extrapolation of current evaluation findings to broader Bambara ASR deployment contexts and the long-term sustainability of the annotation workflow without ongoing facilitator training and quality control.

## Next Checks

1. **Deployment simulation**: Test soloni-114m and QuartzNet models on field recordings from urban markets and informal gatherings (not in training data) to quantify real-world performance degradation and identify specific failure modes (code-switching, background noise, speaker variability).

2. **Evaluation protocol expansion**: Conduct human evaluation studies comparing model outputs against reference transcriptions for proper names, disfluencies, and code-switched segments, developing weighted error metrics that better reflect native speaker acceptability than standard WER/CER.

3. **Annotation efficiency scaling**: Measure annotation throughput when pre-transcribing with soloni-v2 on progressively larger datasets (250h, 500h) to determine whether the 112% improvement holds or diminishes as model error patterns become more diverse and correction time increases.
