# Can LLMs Translate Human Instructions into a Reinforcement Learning Agent's Internal Emergent Symbolic Representation?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24259
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24259
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs can partially translate human instructions into hierarchical RL agent symbolic representations but struggle with granularity, tool use, and lack true symbolic grounding.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can translate human natural language instructions into the emergent symbolic representations learned by hierarchical reinforcement learning agents. The authors evaluate four prominent LLMs (GPT, Claude, Deepseek, Grok) across symbolic partitions generated by the STAR algorithm in Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Results demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit some ability to map instructions to symbolic region sequences, their performance degrades significantly with increased partition granularity and task complexity. The study reveals that current LLMs rely on surface-level patterns rather than genuine symbolic grounding, with particularly poor performance on tasks involving tool use and object manipulation.

## Method Summary
The study employs the STAR hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to generate symbolic partitions in Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Four LLMs (GPT, Claude, Deepseek, Grok) are prompted to translate human instructions into symbolic region sequences based on these partitions. Translation accuracy is evaluated using a modified G-BLEU metric that rewards partial correctness in symbolic sequence prediction. The evaluation includes 18 tasks across two environment types, with instructions varying in complexity and tool-use requirements. The study also conducts mismatch experiments where instructions are paired with incorrect symbolic partitions to test grounding capabilities.

## Key Results
- Translation accuracy decreases systematically as symbolic partition granularity increases
- LLMs perform significantly worse on tool-use tasks involving block pushing compared to pure navigation
- Mismatch experiments show comparable performance to aligned scenarios, indicating surface-level pattern matching rather than true symbolic grounding
- Performance varies considerably across different LLM models and task complexities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that LLMs process symbolic representations through pattern matching rather than genuine semantic understanding. The hierarchical structure of STAR's symbolic partitions provides a structured representation space, but LLMs fail to establish meaningful connections between linguistic concepts and symbolic regions. This mechanistic limitation becomes more apparent as the symbolic space becomes more granular, requiring finer distinctions that exceed the LLMs' pattern-matching capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

### Symbolic Representation Learning
- Why needed: Provides interpretable abstractions from raw state observations
- Quick check: Verify symbolic regions correspond to meaningful environmental features

### Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
- Why needed: Enables temporal abstraction and long-horizon planning
- Quick check: Confirm subgoal decomposition improves task completion rates

### Instruction-Representation Alignment
- Why needed: Bridges human language and machine-understandable symbolic states
- Quick check: Test whether translated symbolic sequences enable successful task execution

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Human Instructions -> LLM Translation Module -> Symbolic Region Sequence -> STAR Agent -> Environment Actions

### Critical Path
Instruction parsing → Symbolic mapping → Sequence generation → Environment execution

### Design Tradeoffs
- Granularity vs. interpretability: Finer partitions increase expressiveness but reduce LLM translation accuracy
- Task complexity vs. model capability: Tool-use tasks exceed current LLM symbolic reasoning capacity
- Evaluation metrics: G-BLEU rewards partial correctness but may not capture semantic alignment

### Failure Signatures
- High G-BLEU on mismatched instruction-partition pairs indicates surface-level pattern matching
- Systematic degradation with partition granularity reveals limitations in fine-grained symbolic reasoning
- Poor tool-use performance indicates inability to model environment state changes

### First Experiments
1. Vary partition granularity systematically to map performance degradation curves
2. Test mismatch scenarios across different instruction types to quantify pattern-matching vs. grounding
3. Compare LLM performance against rule-based symbolic translation baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can grounding mechanisms (e.g., Vision-Language-Action models) enable more reliable alignment between human language and agent internal symbolic representations?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the Discussion: "While we believe that LLMs lack grounding, Vision-Language-Action models are bound to address these limitations in the future" and conclude that "Future research must focus on bridging this gap through enhanced grounding mechanisms."
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs rely on surface-level patterns rather than true symbolic grounding, as evidenced by mismatched instruction-partition experiments yielding comparable results to aligned scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing that VLAs or grounded models achieve higher and more consistent G-BLEU scores across partition granularities, with performance that degrades appropriately under mismatch conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can translation systems be designed to handle dynamic environment changes induced by tool use and object manipulation?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes "LLMs struggle particularly with tasks involving tool use like block pushing" and "fails to understand using tools to interact with the environment."
- Why unresolved: The Ant Fall "after block" phase shows persistently low G-BLEU scores across all partitions, indicating LLMs cannot capture environment state changes from tool interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified architecture or prompting strategy that maintains or improves translation accuracy in the "after block" phase comparable to navigation-only phases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What evaluation metrics beyond G-BLEU could better capture semantic correctness and ordering sensitivity in symbolic sequence translation?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge G-BLEU "rewards partial correctness" but note that LLM outputs "do not necessarily reflect the true symbolic planning process," suggesting the metric may not fully assess semantic alignment.
- Why unresolved: High G-BLEU scores on mismatched instruction-partition pairs indicate the metric may not adequately penalize symbolic misalignment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between G-BLEU scores and task execution success rates, or development of metrics that weight region-sequence ordering more heavily.

## Limitations

- Evaluation framework relies on specific STAR algorithm partitions, limiting generalizability to other symbolic representation methods
- Fixed instruction set may not capture full linguistic variability and ambiguity present in natural human language
- Ground-truth symbolic trajectories represent one possible solution path, potentially biasing evaluation
- Model-specific performance differences suggest architectural factors significantly influence translation capabilities

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Translation accuracy decreases with increasing symbolic partition granularity; LLMs struggle with tool-use tasks like block pushing

**Medium Confidence:** LLMs rely on surface-level patterns rather than true symbolic grounding; performance inconsistency across trials and participants

**Low Confidence:** Broader implications about fundamental limitations in current LLMs' capacity for representation alignment

## Next Checks

1. Cross-architecture validation: Repeat translation task evaluation using symbolic representations from alternative hierarchical RL algorithms (e.g., HIRO, HAC) to assess generalizability beyond the STAR algorithm.

2. Instruction variability study: Expand the instruction set to include paraphrases, ambiguous descriptions, and instructions with varying levels of detail to better understand LLM robustness to linguistic variation.

3. Alternative trajectory evaluation: Develop a metric that accounts for semantically equivalent but syntactically different symbolic sequences to determine if current performance gaps reflect true understanding limitations or evaluation methodology constraints.
