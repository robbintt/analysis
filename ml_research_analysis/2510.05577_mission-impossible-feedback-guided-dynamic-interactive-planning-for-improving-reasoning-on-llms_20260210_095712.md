# Mission Impossible: Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning for Improving Reasoning on LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05577
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05577
- Authors: Dong Yan; Gaochen Wu; Bowen Zhou
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: FGDIP achieves 54.47% F1 on HotpotQA and 70.05% on StrategyQA, outperforming best baselines by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FGDIP, a dynamic multi-hop reasoning framework that overcomes the limitations of fixed-action approaches in open-domain tasks. It starts by extracting key entities, then uses depth-first search with real-time feedback and historical error analysis to iteratively refine reasoning paths. Step and Answer Evaluators guide the process by assessing node feasibility and answer relevance, ensuring systematic convergence toward correct solutions. Experiments show FGDIP achieves 54.47% F1 on HotpotQA and 70.05% on StrategyQA, outperforming the best baselines by 5.03% and 7.25%, respectively. The method also generalizes to closed-domain reasoning tasks, demonstrating adaptability across problem types.

## Method Summary
FGDIP employs a dynamic interactive planning approach that combines entity extraction, depth-first search, and real-time feedback mechanisms. The framework uses Step and Answer Evaluators to assess intermediate reasoning nodes and final answers, respectively. Historical error analysis informs path refinement, while the system iteratively builds reasoning chains through iterative feedback loops. The approach differs from fixed-action methods by adapting its reasoning strategy based on intermediate results and feedback, allowing for more flexible and accurate multi-hop reasoning.

## Key Results
- Achieves 54.47% F1 score on HotpotQA, outperforming best baselines by 5.03%
- Achieves 70.05% accuracy on StrategyQA, outperforming best baselines by 7.25%
- Demonstrates generalization capability across both open and closed-domain reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its dynamic adaptation capabilities. By incorporating real-time feedback and historical error analysis, FGDIP can correct its reasoning path mid-process rather than committing to a potentially flawed trajectory. The Step Evaluator provides immediate feedback on intermediate reasoning nodes, preventing the accumulation of errors, while the Answer Evaluator ensures final outputs meet quality standards. This iterative refinement process, combined with depth-first search that can backtrack when necessary, allows the system to explore multiple reasoning paths efficiently and converge on correct solutions more reliably than static approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-hop reasoning: Required for answering complex questions that need information from multiple sources; quick check: can the system connect two or more pieces of evidence
- Depth-first search: Enables systematic exploration of reasoning paths; quick check: does the search exhaust all relevant branches before backtracking
- Real-time feedback mechanisms: Allows dynamic correction of reasoning paths; quick check: can the system identify and correct errors during the reasoning process
- Entity extraction: Critical for identifying relevant information in open-domain tasks; quick check: can the system accurately identify key entities from text
- Historical error analysis: Enables learning from past mistakes to improve future performance; quick check: does the system maintain and utilize error logs effectively

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Entity Extractor -> Step Evaluator -> DFS Engine -> Answer Evaluator -> Historical Error Database

Critical path: Problem → Entity Extraction → DFS Search → Step Evaluation → Answer Evaluation → Output

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational efficiency for accuracy by performing iterative refinement, but this enables higher quality reasoning through error correction. The depth-first search approach may miss optimal paths in some cases but provides systematic exploration.

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include getting stuck in local optima during DFS, Step Evaluator providing insufficient feedback, or Historical Error Database failing to capture relevant patterns. The system may also struggle with questions requiring extremely long reasoning chains.

First experiments: 1) Run FGDIP on simple single-hop questions to verify basic functionality, 2) Test Step Evaluator alone on intermediate reasoning steps to assess feedback quality, 3) Evaluate DFS performance with synthetic error patterns to validate error correction capabilities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only two datasets (HotpotQA and StrategyQA), restricting generalizability claims
- Results focus on only two metrics (F1 and accuracy) without exploring robustness to adversarial examples
- Closed-domain results presented with less detail and fewer comparative baselines

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Experimental results on evaluated datasets | High |
| Improvements over baselines | Medium |
| Generalization across diverse reasoning tasks | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Cross-dataset validation: Evaluate FGDIP on additional multi-hop reasoning datasets (e.g., QASC, WikiHop) to verify generalization claims and assess performance consistency across different question types and domains.

2. Ablation study on feedback mechanisms: Systematically disable Step Evaluator and Answer Evaluator components separately to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains and verify that the reported improvements aren't solely due to increased computational budget.

3. Scalability and efficiency analysis: Measure computational overhead (tokens processed, inference time) of FGDIP compared to baseline approaches across varying question complexity levels to assess practical deployment feasibility and identify performance bottlenecks.
