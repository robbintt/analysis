core_contribution: This paper presents BLOOMQA, a framework that automatically generates
  large-scale, psychometrically validated benchmarks from domain guidelines without
  relying on human-authored exam banks. It uses LLM-assisted extraction of best practices
  from expert-authored guidelines, converts them into violation-based scenarios, and
  expands them into Bloom taxonomy-enriched MCQs and multi-turn dialogues.

# Automated Benchmark Generation from Domain Guidelines Informed by Bloom's Taxonomy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.20253
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20253
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework generates 60,000+ MCQs and 15,000+ dialogues from domain guidelines, achieving 60-97% discrimination across domains

## Executive Summary
BLOOMQA is an automated framework that generates large-scale, psychometrically validated benchmarks from domain guidelines without requiring human-authored exam banks. The approach uses LLM-assisted extraction of best practices from expert-authored guidelines, converts them into violation-based scenarios, and expands them into Bloom taxonomy-enriched MCQs and multi-turn dialogues. Applied to teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, BLOOMQA demonstrates strong model discrimination and reveals domain-specific effects on LLM reasoning performance.

## Method Summary
BLOOMQA extracts best practices from domain guidelines using LLM assistance, then converts these practices into violation-based scenarios where models must identify incorrect applications. The framework enriches these scenarios with Bloom's taxonomy levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) to create comprehensive MCQs and multi-turn dialogues. The process involves systematic mapping from guideline content to cognitive levels, automated scenario generation, and psychometric validation to ensure benchmark quality and discriminative power.

## Key Results
- Generated 60,000+ MCQs and 15,000+ dialogues across teaching, dietetics, and caregiving domains
- Achieved 60-97% of practices showing significant model discrimination ability
- Revealed non-intuitive LLM behaviors, including better performance on higher-order reasoning for some models
- Fine-tuned models showed consistent gains, particularly in teaching domain applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the structured nature of domain guidelines, which contain explicit best practices that can be systematically converted into assessment scenarios. By using violation-based scenarios rather than correct examples, the benchmarks test practical application and error detection - key competencies in professional domains. The Bloom taxonomy enrichment ensures coverage across cognitive levels, while automated generation enables scalability and reproducibility without human bias from existing exam banks.

## Foundational Learning

**Bloom's Taxonomy** - Hierarchical framework of cognitive skills from basic recall to creative synthesis. Needed to structure assessment across reasoning levels; quick check: can identify which level "design a lesson plan" versus "recall multiplication tables" belongs to.

**Psychometric Validation** - Statistical methods to ensure assessment quality and fairness. Needed to confirm benchmarks measure what they intend and discriminate between model capabilities; quick check: can explain item difficulty and discrimination indices.

**Domain Guidelines Structure** - Expert-authored documents containing best practices and standards. Needed as source material for automated benchmark generation; quick check: can distinguish between guidelines, textbooks, and general documentation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Domain Guidelines -> LLM Extraction -> Best Practices -> Violation Scenarios -> Bloom Enrichment -> MCQs/Dialogues -> Psychometric Validation

**Critical Path**: The core workflow flows from guideline extraction through scenario generation to final benchmark creation, with psychometric validation as the quality gate.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Automation vs. accuracy (LLM-generated content may contain errors), scalability vs. nuance (systematic approach may miss domain subtleties), and taxonomy mapping precision vs. coverage completeness.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor guideline quality leads to irrelevant scenarios, incorrect Bloom level assignments reduce cognitive validity, and insufficient validation results in non-discriminative benchmarks.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test LLM extraction accuracy on sample guidelines, 2) Validate Bloom taxonomy mapping with domain experts, 3) Run pilot discrimination analysis with small LLM set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on discrimination ability without examining construct validity for measuring practical competencies
- Relies on single LLM (GPT-4) for guideline extraction, raising reproducibility concerns with different models
- Tested only on limited set of commercial LLMs and fine-tuned models, lacking comparison to human-authored benchmarks

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Framework's ability to generate large-scale MCQs and dialogues from guidelines, basic discrimination results showing model performance differences

**Medium confidence**: Bloom taxonomy enrichment approach and observed effects on model performance, given complexity of mapping guidelines to cognitive levels

**Low confidence**: Claim that BLOOMQA enables truly generalizable evaluation of contextualized reasoning, due to lack of cross-domain validation and construct validity evidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct expert review of sample generated MCQs and dialogues to assess content validity and appropriateness for measuring practical domain competencies

2. Test generated benchmarks against broader range of LLMs and traditional human-authored benchmarks to establish relative difficulty and discriminative power

3. Perform inter-model consistency checks by generating benchmarks using different LLMs and comparing resulting assessment quality and domain coverage
