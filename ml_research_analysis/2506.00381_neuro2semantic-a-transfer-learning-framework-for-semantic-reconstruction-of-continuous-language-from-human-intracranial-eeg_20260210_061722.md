# Neuro2Semantic: A Transfer Learning Framework for Semantic Reconstruction of Continuous Language from Human Intracranial EEG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.00381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00381
- Reference count: 0
- Reconstructs continuous language semantics from 30 minutes of iEEG with BLEU 0.079 and BERTScore 0.195

## Executive Summary
Neuro2Semantic addresses the challenge of decoding continuous language semantics from intracranial EEG recordings, overcoming limitations of prior classification-based approaches by enabling unconstrained text generation. The method employs a two-phase transfer learning framework: first, an LSTM adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings using contrastive loss; second, a Vec2Text corrector module generates natural language from these aligned embeddings. The approach achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of training data, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in low-data settings.

## Method Summary
The Neuro2Semantic framework processes stereotactic EEG recordings from three epilepsy patients who listened to podcast-style speech. The method extracts high-gamma band (70-150 Hz) envelope via Hilbert transform, downsampling to 100 Hz, and segments neural data by sentence timestamps. A two-phase transfer learning approach is employed: Phase 1 trains an LSTM adapter to align neural embeddings with text embeddings from the pre-trained text-embedding-ada-002 model using a contrastive plus triplet margin loss; Phase 2 freezes this adapter and fine-tunes a Vec2Text corrector to generate natural language from the aligned neural embeddings. The system is trained on approximately 30 minutes of data and evaluated using BLEU and BERTScore metrics with leave-one-out cross-validation.

## Key Results
- Achieves BLEU score of 0.079 and BERTScore of 0.195 on semantic reconstruction task
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.6% and 8.8% respectively in low-data settings
- Demonstrates effective zero-shot generalization to unseen semantic content
- Shows scalability with increased data and electrode coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging transfer learning to bridge the gap between neural signals and semantic representations. The LSTM adapter learns to map variable-length neural segments to fixed-dimensional embeddings that align with pre-trained text embeddings, effectively translating neural activity patterns into semantic space. The Vec2Text corrector then learns to generate natural language from these aligned embeddings, enabling reconstruction of continuous speech content rather than discrete classifications.

## Foundational Learning
- iEEG signal processing: Extracting high-gamma envelope from raw neural recordings provides the temporal dynamics needed for semantic decoding
- Contrastive learning: Aligning neural and text embeddings in a shared semantic space enables cross-modal translation
- Text embedding models: Using pre-trained embeddings provides a rich semantic representation space for alignment
- Sequence-to-sequence modeling: Converting aligned embeddings back to natural language requires capturing sequential dependencies
- Transfer learning: Adapting pre-trained models to neural data enables effective learning from limited examples

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** iEEG preprocessing -> LSTM adapter -> Vec2Text corrector -> Text generation

**Critical Path:** High-gamma envelope extraction → LSTM adapter alignment → Vec2Text fine-tuning → BLEU/BERTScore evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The two-phase approach trades off computational efficiency for modularity - separating alignment from generation allows focused optimization but requires careful hyperparameter coordination between phases

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Low cosine similarity between neural and text embeddings after Phase 1 indicates alignment failure
- Vec2Text generating generic or repetitive text suggests insufficient adapter convergence or embedding variance
- Performance plateaus with additional electrodes may indicate suboptimal channel selection

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate baseline alignment by computing cosine similarity between neural and text embeddings before and after Phase 1 training
2. Test adapter architecture sensitivity by comparing single-layer vs multi-layer LSTM performance on alignment metrics
3. Evaluate electrode selection impact by training with random vs significance-selected channel subsets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can transformer-based architectures outperform the LSTM adapter in the alignment phase when trained on larger datasets?
- Does the current decoding performance generalize to non-clinical populations given the small sample size?
- What are the optimal electrode coverage patterns for semantic decoding?

## Limitations
- Small sample size (3 subjects) and clinical population limit generalizability to healthy brains
- Critical architectural details like LSTM configuration and triplet loss parameters are underspecified
- No ablation studies demonstrating the specific contribution of the transfer learning approach versus baseline model capacity

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Task formulation and overall transfer learning framework concept; hyperparameter values provided (α=0.25, τ=0.1, 100 epochs, batch 8)
- **Medium confidence**: Reported performance metrics and relative improvement claims; the two-phase methodology description
- **Low confidence**: Critical architectural details (LSTM configuration, triplet loss parameters, electrode selection criteria, Vec2Text initialization)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test a simplified ablation with a single-layer unidirectional LSTM using mean pooling to establish baseline alignment performance before adding architectural complexity
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the α parameter in the alignment loss to verify the 0.25 weighting is optimal versus pure contrastive or triplet loss
3. Perform electrode-wise ablation studies to quantify the impact of the "significance selection" preprocessing step on final reconstruction quality
