- Primary result: Introduces Kandinsky 5.0, a family of high-resolution image and video generation models with up to 19B parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance in visual quality and motion dynamics.

## Executive Summary
Kandinsky 5.0 introduces a family of high-resolution image and video generation models designed to overcome computational and scalability challenges in generative AI. The framework includes Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite (6B parameters), Video Lite (2B parameters), and Video Pro (19B parameters), all based on a unified Diffusion Transformer (CrossDiT) architecture. Key innovations include the Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention (NABLA) mechanism, which reduces attention computation complexity by up to 2.7x while maintaining quality, and a multi-stage training pipeline combining pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, distillation, and reinforcement learning-based post-training.

## Key Results
- Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite outperforms Sora and Wan in visual fidelity on MovieGen benchmark
- Video Pro variant excels in both visual quality and motion dynamics
- NABLA mechanism reduces attention computation complexity by up to 2.7x while maintaining quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Kandinsky 5.0 leverages a unified Diffusion Transformer (CrossDiT) architecture that enables efficient processing of both images and videos through a shared framework. The key innovation is the Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention (NABLA) mechanism, which optimizes attention computation by focusing on relevant spatial blocks rather than full-resolution attention maps. This reduces computational complexity from O(N²) to approximately O(N^1.5) while preserving visual quality. The multi-stage training pipeline, combining pre-training on curated datasets, supervised fine-tuning, distillation from larger models, and reinforcement learning-based post-training, ensures the models learn both general visual generation capabilities and specific motion dynamics. The use of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and residual connections in the transformer blocks helps maintain temporal consistency in video generation while preserving high-resolution detail.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Transformers**: Why needed - Enables iterative refinement of image/video quality through denoising steps. Quick check - Model generates progressively cleaner outputs over denoising steps.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Why needed - Captures long-range dependencies in visual data. Quick check - Visual quality improves with attention scaling.
- **Multi-stage Training**: Why needed - Allows progressive learning from general to specific generation capabilities. Quick check - Performance improves across training stages.
- **Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning**: Why needed - Optimizes models for human preference and specific metrics. Quick check - Human evaluation scores improve post-RL.
- **Hardware-aware Optimization**: Why needed - Enables efficient deployment across different GPU configurations. Quick check - Memory usage scales predictably with model size.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Tokens -> CrossDiT Blocks -> NABLA Attention -> Residual Connections -> Output Tokens

**Critical Path**: Input encoding → CrossDiT transformer blocks → NABLA attention computation → Feature refinement → Output generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture prioritizes visual quality over generation speed, using 50-100 denoising steps. The NABLA mechanism trades some attention coverage for significant computational efficiency. The unified CrossDiT approach sacrifices some modality-specific optimizations for training and deployment simplicity.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor temporal consistency in generated videos, loss of fine detail at high resolutions, or excessive artifacts in complex scenes may indicate attention mechanism issues or insufficient training data diversity.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test single-image generation quality at various resolutions. 2) Evaluate video generation with simple motion patterns. 3) Benchmark attention computation time with and without NABLA.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the unified CrossDiT architecture compare to specialized models for specific modalities?
- What are the limitations of the NABLA mechanism in capturing very long-range dependencies?
- How does the multi-stage training approach scale to even larger model sizes?

## Limitations
- High computational requirements for training and inference
- Potential bias in generated content based on training data
- Limited evaluation of long-form video generation capabilities

## Confidence

## Next Checks
1. Verify computational efficiency claims by benchmarking attention computation with and without NABLA on representative datasets
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each training stage on final model performance
3. Test model robustness across diverse input prompts and evaluate for potential bias in generated outputs
