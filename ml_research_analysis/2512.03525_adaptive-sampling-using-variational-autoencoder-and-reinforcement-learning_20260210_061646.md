# Adaptive sampling using variational autoencoder and reinforcement learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03525
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03525
- Reference count: 13
- One-line primary result: VAE-RL adaptive sensing significantly outperforms optimal sensor placement and VAE with random sampling on MNIST reconstruction quality.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an adaptive sparse sensing framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) generative prior with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve signal reconstruction from limited measurements. Unlike classical compressed sensing (CS), which relies on generic bases and random sampling, or optimal sensor placement (OSP), which uses fixed linear patterns, the proposed method adaptively selects informative measurement locations for each signal using a learned policy. The RL agent is trained via proximal policy optimization (PPO) to sequentially choose where to sample next, guided by reconstruction performance measured through a pretrained CNN classifier. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that the VAE-RL approach significantly outperforms both OSP and VAE-based random sampling in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM), producing sharper and more accurate reconstructions by concentrating measurements on digit-specific strokes.

## Method Summary
The framework couples a pretrained VAE decoder (serving as a generative prior) with a PPO-based RL agent that sequentially selects pixel locations to measure. The agent observes the current reconstruction, chooses a measurement location, acquires the measurement, re-optimizes the latent code to fit the new data, and receives a reward based on downstream classification accuracy. The VAE is trained offline on the full dataset, then its decoder is frozen and used to constrain reconstructions. The RL policy learns to maximize classification accuracy by strategically placing measurements where they most reduce reconstruction uncertainty for each specific signal.

## Key Results
- VAE-RL achieves significantly lower MSE and higher SSIM than both OSP (POD-QR) and VAE with random sampling across 20-60 measurements on MNIST.
- The method concentrates measurements on semantically important regions (digit strokes) rather than uniformly distributed locations.
- Adaptive sampling with generative priors provides sample efficiency gains over classical CS approaches that rely on generic sparsity assumptions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Generative Prior Constrains Signal Manifold
A learned nonlinear generative prior restricts reconstructions to plausible signals, improving sample efficiency over generic bases. The VAE decoder G maps a low-dimensional latent space (k=64) to the signal space. Reconstruction solves for latent code z that best explains measurements via ẑ = argmin_z ||CG(z) - y||² (Eq. 6). This implicitly encodes domain structure without hand-crafted sparsity assumptions. If test signals fall outside the training distribution, the manifold constraint may bias reconstructions toward incorrect priors.

### Mechanism 2: Sequentially Adaptive Measurement Selection
An RL policy learns to place measurements where they maximally reduce reconstruction uncertainty for each specific signal. At each step t, the policy network observes the current partial reconstruction (state s_t) and selects a pixel location to measure (action c_t). The measurement is acquired, the latent code is re-optimized, and a reward is issued based on classification correctness. PPO updates the policy to favor high-return trajectories (Eq. 19). If the initial probe measurements (m_p random points) are insufficient for the policy to infer structure, subsequent selections may be uninformative.

### Mechanism 3: Classification-Based Reward Signal
Using downstream classification accuracy as reward guides the agent to select perceptually salient regions. A pretrained CNN classifies the current reconstruction. The agent receives +1 for correct classification, -1 otherwise. This directly ties measurement selection to semantic reconstruction quality rather than pixel-wise error. If reconstructions are misclassified for reasons unrelated to sampling (e.g., classifier bias), reward signal becomes noisy and policy learning degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**
  - Why needed here: The VAE provides the generative prior G(z) that constrains reconstructions. Understanding the encoder-decoder structure, latent space regularization (KL divergence), and how to sample from the decoder is essential.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the decoder can be used independently of the encoder for reconstruction?

- **Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - Why needed here: The RL agent uses PPO to learn the sampling policy. Understanding the clipped objective (Eq. 19), advantage estimation, and policy gradient basics is required to debug training instability.
  - Quick check question: What problem does the clipping parameter ε solve in PPO?

- **Concept: Compressed Sensing and Sparsity**
  - Why needed here: The paper positions itself against classical CS and OSP. Understanding ℓ₁ regularization, underdetermined systems, and why random measurements can suffice provides context for the improvements claimed.
  - Quick check question: Why does classical CS require sparsity in some transform basis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VAE Encoder -> 64-dim latent -> VAE Decoder (G) ; Pretrained CNN -> Reward ; Policy Network (Conv encoder + action/value heads) -> Action (pixel location) -> Measurement acquisition -> Latent optimization -> Reconstruction -> CNN classification

- **Critical path**: 1. Train VAE on full dataset (20 epochs). 2. Freeze VAE decoder. 3. Train RL policy with PPO. 4. At inference: acquire m_p probe measurements → iterate m_a adaptive steps (policy selects, measure, re-optimize z, compute reward).

- **Design tradeoffs**: Probe budget m_p vs. adaptive budget m_a: More probe measurements stabilize initial state but reduce adaptive capacity. Latent dimension (k=64): Larger captures more detail but increases reconstruction optimization cost. Reward choice: Classification-based reward is semantically meaningful but indirect; MSE-based reward is direct but may not align with perceptual quality.

- **Failure signatures**: Policy collapse: Agent repeatedly selects same pixel (check action entropy during training). Poor generalization: High reward on training digits, low on test digits (indicates overfitting to training manifold). Reconstruction divergence: Latent optimization fails to converge (check learning rate, initialization).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Baseline sanity check: Train VAE, verify reconstruction quality on full images (no sampling). Confirm decoder is competent before adding RL. 2. Ablation on m_p: Sweep probe measurements {5, 10, 20, 50} with fixed m_a=40. Plot MSE vs. m_p to find minimum viable probe. 3. Reward comparison: Replace classification reward with MSE-based reward. Compare final SSIM/MSE to isolate the effect of semantic vs. pixel-wise supervision.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the proposed framework maintain its efficiency and reconstruction quality when applied to higher-resolution images and more complex datasets?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that "extending the framework to higher-resolution images and more complex datasets would test the scalability of both the VAE prior and the RL policy."
- Why unresolved: The experiments are conducted exclusively on the low-resolution MNIST dataset (28x28 pixels), leaving the method's performance on high-dimensional data unproven.
- Evidence: Successful application of the VAE-RL framework to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100 or medical imaging) without excessive computational cost or training instability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can alternative generative models, such as diffusion models or GANs, provide superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the VAE in this adaptive sensing context?
- Basis in paper: The conclusion suggests that "exploring alternative generative models such as diffusion models or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may further improve reconstruction fidelity."
- Why unresolved: The study relies solely on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which tends to produce blurry reconstructions due to the Gaussian loss assumption; sharper priors have not been tested within the RL loop.
- Evidence: A comparative study showing that a diffusion-based prior yields lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores than the VAE baseline for the same number of measurements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can uncertainty quantification be formally integrated into the policy to enable risk-aware measurement selection?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that "incorporating uncertainty quantification into the generative model or the policy could enable risk-aware measurement selection."
- Why unresolved: The current Reinforcement Learning agent bases decisions on a deterministic reconstruction state, ignoring the confidence level of the generative model's output.
- Evidence: A modified agent that utilizes latent space variance to guide sampling, resulting in robust reconstruction quality even when initial measurements are noisy or ambiguous.

## Limitations
- The method's generalization beyond MNIST (e.g., to natural images or other domains) remains unproven, as does its performance with different latent dimensionalities or probe budgets.
- The computational cost of iterative latent optimization at each adaptive step could be prohibitive for real-time applications.
- The classification-based reward signal effectiveness depends heavily on the pretrained CNN's ability to generalize to partially reconstructed images—a potential weakness not thoroughly validated.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The VAE provides a valid generative prior that constrains reconstructions to the training manifold. The PPO implementation with classification reward is technically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The sequential adaptive sampling policy learns meaningful measurement strategies that outperform random sampling and OSP on MNIST. The improvement is statistically significant but may not generalize.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about semantic saliency of selected measurements and the general applicability of classification-based rewards to other domains. The assumption that classification accuracy is a reliable proxy for reconstruction quality is plausible but untested.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate the trained policy on out-of-distribution digits (e.g., rotated, scaled, or corrupted MNIST samples) and other datasets (e.g., Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10) to assess robustness and identify failure modes.

2. **Ablation on Reward Design**: Replace the classification-based reward with direct MSE improvement per step. Compare final reconstruction quality and policy behavior to isolate whether semantic or pixel-wise supervision is more effective.

3. **Probe Budget Sensitivity**: Systematically sweep the number of initial probe measurements (m_p) from 5 to 50 with fixed adaptive budget (m_a=40). Plot reconstruction MSE vs. m_p to identify the minimum viable probe for stable policy performance.
