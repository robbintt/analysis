## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods across the machine learning pipeline for healthcare applications. The study identifies a gap in systematic evaluation of UQ methods across different pipeline stages, particularly in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Through a systematic review of recent literature, the authors categorize UQ methods by domain, dataset, and task, and analyze their integration into each stage of the ML pipeline. The survey highlights the most popular UQ techniques used in healthcare, such as Bayesian neural networks, ensemble methods, and evidential deep learning, while also exploring novel approaches from other domains with potential for medical applications.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes 40+ papers to create a conceptual framework mapping uncertainty quantification techniques to pipeline stages. The methodology involves categorizing UQ methods (Bayesian, Ensemble, Evidential) and analyzing their application across data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Key comparisons include Monte Carlo Dropout vs. Deep Ensembles vs. Evidential Deep Learning. The framework leverages 94 open-source healthcare datasets (ACDC, MIMIC-IV, ISIC) as reference points but does not release original data or code.

## Key Results
- Identifies systematic gaps in UQ evaluation across pipeline stages
- Categorizes UQ methods by domain, dataset, and task integration
- Highlights Bayesian neural networks, ensemble methods, and evidential deep learning as dominant approaches
- Emphasizes need for holistic uncertainty management at each pipeline stage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Bayesian Deep Learning for Uncertainty Estimation
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty through probability distributions over network weights. This enables principled uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference, where sampling from weight distributions produces varied predictions whose variance indicates model uncertainty. The mechanism assumes approximate inference methods faithfully represent the true posterior and that training data is representative of deployment conditions.

### Mechanism 2: Ensemble Diversity for Robust Uncertainty
Deep ensembles provide reliable uncertainty estimates by aggregating predictions across independently trained models. Prediction disagreement across ensemble members indicates higher uncertainty, particularly effective for detecting out-of-distribution samples. The mechanism assumes diversity across ensemble members reflects true predictive uncertainty rather than training artifacts.

### Mechanism 3: Conformal Prediction for Calibrated Confidence
Conformal prediction provides distribution-free confidence intervals with statistical guarantees, enabling principled risk management. Based on calibration data, it constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true label with user-specified probability. The mechanism assumes calibration data is exchangeable with test data.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Epistemic vs. Aleatoric Uncertainty**
  - Why needed here: Critical for determining whether uncertainty can be reduced with more data (epistemic) or is inherent to the problem (aleatoric); guides clinical decision-making and data collection priorities.
  - Quick check question: Given a model with high uncertainty on rare disease cases, would collecting more labeled examples likely reduce this uncertainty? If yes, it's primarily epistemic.

- **Concept: Model Calibration**
  - Why needed here: Calibrated confidence estimates (e.g., 80% confidence corresponds to 80% accuracy) are essential for clinical trust; miscalibrated models provide misleading uncertainty signals.
  - Quick check question: If your model outputs 70% confidence on average for positive predictions, but only 50% of those predictions are actually positive, is the model well-calibrated?

- **Concept: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection**
  - Why needed here: Clinical deployment often encounters data from different hospitals, patient populations, or imaging equipment; OOD detection flags cases where model predictions are unreliable.
  - Quick check question: A model trained on MRI scans from Hospital A is deployed at Hospital B with different scanner protocols. Should uncertainty estimates increase, and which mechanism would best capture this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation
- **Critical path:** Data preprocessing (ensuring clean, well-labeled inputs) → Model training (selecting appropriate UQ method based on computational constraints and clinical requirements) → Evaluation (calibration and OOD testing on held-out data representing deployment conditions)
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - BNNs: Strong uncertainty quantification but high computational cost; suitable for offline analysis, not real-time inference
  - Ensembles: Good balance of performance and uncertainty quality; requires 5-10× training and inference resources
  - EDL: Single-pass inference with uncertainty; may produce overconfident estimates without regularization
  - Conformal prediction: Post-hoc method requiring calibration data; provides guarantees but sensitive to distribution shift
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Overconfident predictions on OOD data (uncertainty estimates don't increase appropriately)
  - Miscalibrated confidence (high confidence predictions frequently wrong)
  - Inconsistent uncertainty across demographic subgroups (fairness/bias issues)
  - Uncertainty decomposition fails (cannot distinguish epistemic from aleatoric sources)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline calibration check:** Train a standard model on your clinical dataset; evaluate calibration using Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score; compare against MC Dropout baseline (5-10 forward passes)
  2. **OOD detection benchmark:** Hold out data from a different hospital/patient population; evaluate whether uncertainty estimates (entropy, ensemble variance) correlate with prediction errors on this OOD set
  3. **Ensemble vs. BNN comparison:** Train a 5-model ensemble and a BNN (via MC Dropout or variational inference) on the same task; compare calibration, uncertainty quality, and computational cost on a validation set with known distribution shift

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we design a unified framework that systematically integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) across all stages of the machine learning pipeline—preprocessing, training, and evaluation—rather than in isolation?
The authors identify that UQ is typically applied in isolation (mostly during training), leading to "uncertainty propagation and compounded errors." Current research is fragmented; few studies analyze method efficacy across different development stages simultaneously, making it difficult to mitigate uncertainty holistically.

### Open Question 2
What standardized evaluation protocols are necessary to ensure the clinical reliability and reproducibility of UQ methods in healthcare?
The paper notes the "lack of standardized evaluation frameworks" and inconsistent metrics. Evaluation currently relies on indirect task performance rather than direct uncertainty metrics like calibration or Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, leading to inconsistent clinical translation.

### Open Question 3
How can UQ methods be refined to distinguish clinically actionable uncertainty from data noise or measurement artifacts?
The authors state that distinguishing true uncertainty (aleatoric/epistemic) from noise is crucial but currently underdeveloped. No consensus exists on clinically meaningful UQ metrics, and many approaches lack the input needed to differentiate ambiguity from data errors.

## Limitations
- Analysis relies heavily on conceptual categorization rather than empirical benchmarking across methods
- Coverage may be biased toward surveyed papers' focus areas, potentially underrepresenting emerging techniques
- Computational complexity claims for BNNs and ensembles are based on literature consensus rather than systematic measurement

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The conceptual framework mapping UQ methods to pipeline stages; identification of key UQ techniques (BNNs, ensembles, EDL); general characterization of epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty relevance to healthcare
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative claims about method performance (e.g., ensembles vs. MC Dropout calibration); computational cost assessments; claims about clinical applicability
- **Low confidence**: Specific quantitative comparisons between methods; effectiveness of novel techniques without extensive validation; generalizability across all healthcare domains

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical benchmarking**: Implement and compare MC Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and EDL on a standard medical imaging task (e.g., ACDC dataset) to validate the survey's qualitative performance rankings

2. **Distribution shift evaluation**: Test whether uncertainty estimates actually correlate with prediction errors on out-of-distribution clinical data (different hospitals, patient populations) as claimed

3. **Computational cost analysis**: Systematically measure inference time and resource requirements for each UQ method on representative hardware to validate the claimed tradeoffs between accuracy and computational expense
