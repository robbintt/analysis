# A Modified VGG19-Based Framework for Accurate and Interpretable Real-Time Bone Fracture Detection

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.03739
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03739
- **Reference count:** 19
- **Primary result:** Modified VGG-19 model achieves 99.78% classification accuracy and AUC of 1.00 for bone fracture detection

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a modified VGG-19 framework for bone fracture detection that combines advanced image preprocessing with deep learning to achieve exceptional accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The approach addresses limitations in existing models by incorporating CLAHE, Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection to enhance X-ray image quality and facilitate feature extraction. The model includes Grad-CAM for explainable AI, generating visual heatmaps to highlight areas responsible for predictions. Deployed as a real-time web application, the framework provides diagnostic feedback within 0.5 seconds, offering healthcare professionals a fast, accurate, and interpretable tool for bone fracture detection.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a modified VGG-19 architecture enhanced with sophisticated preprocessing techniques to improve bone fracture detection from X-ray images. The preprocessing pipeline includes CLAHE for contrast enhancement, Otsu's thresholding for binarization, and Canny edge detection to highlight structural details. The modified VGG-19 model is trained on these preprocessed images to classify fractures with high accuracy. Grad-CAM is integrated to provide visual interpretability by generating heatmaps that highlight regions contributing to model predictions. The entire system is deployed as a real-time web application using Flask, enabling healthcare professionals to receive diagnostic feedback in under 0.5 seconds.

## Key Results
- Modified VGG-19 model achieves 99.78% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00
- Real-time inference capability delivers results within 0.5 seconds via web application
- Grad-CAM interpretability successfully generates visual heatmaps highlighting fracture regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages deep learning's ability to automatically extract hierarchical features from enhanced X-ray images, while interpretability through Grad-CAM builds clinical trust by visualizing prediction rationale. The preprocessing techniques (CLAHE, Otsu's thresholding, Canny edge detection) enhance image quality and emphasize fracture-related features, making them more distinguishable for the CNN. The modified VGG-19 architecture, known for its effectiveness in image classification, is adapted to focus on the specific characteristics of bone fractures in X-ray imagery.

## Foundational Learning

**CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):** Local contrast enhancement technique that prevents over-amplification of noise while improving visibility of features. *Why needed:* X-ray images often have poor contrast between fracture lines and surrounding bone tissue. *Quick check:* Compare contrast enhancement results across different clipping limits.

**Otsu's Thresholding:** Automatic binarization method that finds optimal threshold separating foreground and background based on image histogram. *Why needed:* Simplifies image data by separating bone structures from background, reducing computational complexity. *Quick check:* Verify threshold selection produces clean bone segmentation.

**Canny Edge Detection:** Multi-stage algorithm for detecting edges with optimal signal-to-noise ratio. *Why needed:* Highlights fracture lines and structural discontinuities that may indicate breaks. *Quick check:* Adjust sigma parameter to balance edge detection sensitivity.

**Grad-CAM:** Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping technique for visualizing CNN decision regions. *Why needed:* Provides clinical interpretability by showing which image regions influence predictions. *Quick check:* Overlay heatmaps on original images to verify anatomical correspondence.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** X-ray Image → CLAHE → Otsu's Thresholding → Canny Edge Detection → Modified VGG-19 → Classification + Grad-CAM → Web Application

**Critical Path:** Image preprocessing (CLAHE → Otsu → Canny) → Feature extraction (VGG-19 layers) → Classification → Grad-CAM visualization → Web interface

**Design Tradeoffs:** High accuracy achieved through extensive preprocessing may reduce generalization across different X-ray protocols. Real-time deployment requires balancing model complexity with inference speed.

**Failure Signatures:** Over-reliance on preprocessing may cause poor performance on unprocessed images; Grad-CAM heatmaps may highlight non-fracture features if training data contains artifacts.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test model performance on unprocessed X-ray images to assess preprocessing dependency. 2) Evaluate Grad-CAM heatmap accuracy against radiologist annotations. 3) Measure inference time across different hardware configurations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Model performance claims (99.78% accuracy, AUC of 1.00) lack external validation and may reflect dataset-specific characteristics
- Preprocessing steps may introduce bias toward specific imaging conditions, limiting generalizability across different X-ray equipment
- Grad-CAM interpretability has not been clinically validated by radiologists to confirm that highlighted regions correspond to actual fracture features

## Confidence
- Model performance metrics: Medium (internally validated only)
- Preprocessing methodology: Medium (standard techniques but dataset-specific application)
- Interpretability through Grad-CAM: Medium (methodologically correct but not clinically validated)
- Real-time deployment feasibility: Medium (technically feasible but not tested in clinical workflow)

## Next Checks
1. Test the model on multiple external datasets from different hospitals with varying X-ray equipment to assess generalization performance.
2. Conduct a blinded study with radiologists comparing model predictions and heatmaps against expert diagnoses to validate clinical utility.
3. Perform ablation studies to determine the actual contribution of each preprocessing step and the modified VGG-19 architecture to overall performance.
