# Data Quality Challenges in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.00552
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00552
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: 15 data quality dimensions identified across 4 RAG stages through 16 expert interviews, with 73 of 113 challenges concentrated in early extraction/transformation stages

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates data quality challenges in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through 16 semi-structured interviews with IT practitioners. The research identifies 15 distinct data quality dimensions across four sequential RAG processing stages: data extraction, transformation, prompt & search, and generation. A key finding is that data quality challenges are heavily concentrated in the early stages (extraction and transformation), accounting for 73 of 113 total challenges. The study also introduces "accountability" as a new data quality dimension specific to RAG contexts, addressing ownership and compliance issues not captured by traditional frameworks.

## Method Summary
The study employed an inductive qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with 16 RAG practitioners from two large IT service companies. Each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes, with participants averaging 2.5 years of RAG experience. Data analysis followed the Gioia methodology (2013), involving open coding by one author, two 3-hour consensus-building workshops, and iterative aggregation from first-order concepts to second-order themes and ultimately to 15 aggregated data quality dimensions. The researchers adopted Wang & Strong's (1996) data quality terminology for consistency while identifying new challenges specific to RAG systems.

## Key Results
- 15 data quality dimensions identified across 4 RAG stages (extraction, transformation, prompt & search, generation)
- 73 of 113 total challenges concentrated in early RAG stages (extraction and transformation)
- Accountability emerges as new data quality dimension specific to RAG contexts
- Data quality issues propagate sequentially through RAG processing steps, requiring step-aware quality management

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The research demonstrates that data quality challenges in RAG systems are not uniform across processing stages but rather concentrate heavily in early pipeline stages. This concentration occurs because extraction and transformation processes handle the raw data that ultimately feeds the entire RAG system, making these stages critical for downstream quality. The sequential nature of RAG processing means that quality issues created in early stages propagate through subsequent steps, amplifying their impact on final output quality.

## Foundational Learning
**Data Quality Dimensions**: Why needed - Traditional frameworks like Wang & Strong (1996) don't fully capture RAG-specific challenges. Quick check - Review the 15 dimensions identified and compare with existing literature.

**RAG Pipeline Stages**: Why needed - Understanding how data flows through RAG systems is crucial for identifying where quality issues emerge. Quick check - Map each of the 15 dimensions to their respective RAG stage(s).

**Qualitative Research Methods**: Why needed - The study uses inductive coding to discover challenges rather than testing predefined hypotheses. Quick check - Understand Gioia methodology and how it differs from deductive approaches.

**Data Quality Propagation**: Why needed - Issues in early stages compound through the pipeline, affecting final output. Quick check - Identify which dimensions are most likely to propagate and why.

**Accountability Dimension**: Why needed - New concept specific to RAG systems addressing ownership and compliance. Quick check - Compare with traditional data quality dimensions to understand what's novel.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Extraction -> Data Transformation -> Prompt & Search -> Generation

**Critical Path**: The extraction and transformation stages form the critical path for data quality, as 73 of 113 challenges occur in these early stages. Issues here propagate through the entire system.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The sequential nature of RAG processing creates a tradeoff between processing efficiency and quality control. Early-stage optimizations may be more impactful than later-stage fixes, but also more difficult to implement without disrupting the entire pipeline.

**Failure Signatures**: Quality issues manifest as degraded retrieval relevance, incomplete or incorrect generation outputs, and system unreliability. Early-stage failures (extraction/transformation) typically cascade to affect all downstream processes.

**First Experiments**:
1. Map the 15 data quality dimensions to specific technical implementation challenges in a sample RAG system
2. Track data quality metrics at each RAG stage to empirically demonstrate propagation effects
3. Design interventions targeting the top 3 most problematic dimensions and measure their impact on overall RAG performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How do data quality challenges propagate across sequential RAG processing steps, and which cross-step dependencies most strongly predict downstream output quality?
Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Future work should... investigate these cross-dimensional relationships to identify dependencies where DQ issues are created and then propagate through multiple processing stages throughout the RAG system."
Why unresolved: The study examined challenges within individual steps but did not model interactions between steps or measure how upstream issues causally influence downstream quality.
What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal or experimental study tracing specific seeded DQ issues through all four RAG stages, with quantitative metrics linking each upstream challenge to measurable output degradation.

**Open Question 2**: Can quantitative metrics systematically measure the identified DQ challenges and predict RAG system effectiveness?
Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note: "Future research should develop quantitative methods and metrics to systematically measure DQ" and mention RAGAs as a promising but unvalidated starting point with mixed results.
Why unresolved: Current evaluation frameworks like RAGAs show inconsistent alignment with expert assessments, and no validated metrics exist for newly identified dimensions like Accountability or Semantic Integration.
What evidence would resolve it: Development and empirical validation of measurement instruments for each of the 15 dimensions, demonstrated through correlation with both expert judgments and objective RAG performance outcomes.

**Open Question 3**: What mitigation strategies effectively address the identified DQ challenges across different RAG stages?
Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude: "Future work should transition from identifying problems to implementing and assessing solutions for DQ management in RAG."
Why unresolved: This study focused on problem identification through expert interviews; no interventions were designed, implemented, or evaluated.
What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments testing specific interventions (e.g., chunking strategies, provenance tracking, ownership frameworks) targeting high-priority challenges, with pre-post quality measurements.

**Open Question 4**: Do the identified DQ challenges generalize across organizational sizes, industries, and RAG architectures beyond large IT service providers?
Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state: "Future research should confirm whether these DQ challenges are consistent across a broader range of organizations and industries, or if additional challenges emerge in different contexts."
Why unresolved: All 16 expert participants came from two large IT service companies, and 73 of 113 coded challenges concentrated in early stages; it is unknown whether this distribution holds for smaller organizations or different RAG implementations.
What evidence would resolve it: Replication studies across diverse organizational contexts with comparative analysis of challenge frequency, distribution across stages, and emergence of context-specific dimensions.

## Limitations
- Sample limited to 16 practitioners from two large IT service companies, potentially missing industry-specific challenges
- Interview protocol and detailed codebook not fully disclosed, limiting reproducibility
- Qualitative findings based on researcher interpretation, introducing potential subjectivity
- No quantitative validation of the relative severity or frequency of identified challenges

## Confidence
**High**: Identification of 15 data quality dimensions across RAG stages is well-supported by interview data and established methodology
**Medium**: The newly proposed "accountability" dimension is credible but may reflect specific organizational contexts rather than universal RAG challenges
**Medium**: Sequential propagation of quality issues is logically sound but requires empirical validation across more diverse implementations

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a broader sample including RAG practitioners from diverse industries (healthcare, finance, manufacturing) to test generalizability of the 15 dimensions and the accountability concept
2. Conduct a quantitative survey of RAG practitioners to measure the relative frequency and severity of challenges across all four RAG stages, validating the qualitative findings about concentration in early stages
3. Implement a controlled experiment tracking data quality metrics through each RAG processing step to empirically demonstrate how quality issues propagate sequentially through the pipeline
