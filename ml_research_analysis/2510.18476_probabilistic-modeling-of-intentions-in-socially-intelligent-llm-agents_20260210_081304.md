# Probabilistic Modeling of Intentions in Socially Intelligent LLM Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.18476
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18476
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Introduces Bayesian intent modeling framework showing 9.0% improvement on SOTOPIA-All benchmark

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a probabilistic framework for modeling intentions in socially intelligent LLM agents using belief distributions updated through Bayesian inference. The approach enables agents to handle uncertainty in partner intentions without requiring parameter training, providing contextual grounding for dialogue strategies. The framework was evaluated on the SOTOPIA benchmark, demonstrating consistent improvements in multi-dimensional social performance compared to baseline models.

## Method Summary
The framework employs belief distributions over partner intentions that are updated via Bayesian inference after each utterance in dialogue. This probabilistic approach allows agents to maintain uncertainty about partner intentions while progressively refining their understanding throughout interactions. The method leverages the existing capabilities of LLMs without requiring additional training, instead focusing on how to represent and update beliefs about social intentions during conversations.

## Key Results
- Overall score improved by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All benchmark compared to Qwen2.5-7B baseline
- Performance on SOTOPIA-Hard improved by 4.1% relative to baseline
- Framework slightly surpassed an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Bayesian framework works by maintaining probabilistic beliefs about partner intentions that are continuously updated as new conversational evidence arrives. This approach naturally handles uncertainty in social interactions, allowing agents to make decisions even when intentions are ambiguous. By avoiding explicit parameter training, the method leverages existing LLM capabilities while adding a principled way to reason about social intentions.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian inference: Essential for updating beliefs about intentions based on conversational evidence; quick check: verify posterior updates correctly normalize and incorporate new information
- Belief distributions: Required to represent uncertainty in partner intentions; quick check: ensure distributions remain valid probability distributions after updates
- Probabilistic reasoning: Fundamental for handling ambiguity in social interactions; quick check: test framework's performance with varying levels of intention ambiguity
- Dialogue context modeling: Needed to interpret utterances in social context; quick check: verify context incorporation doesn't lead to drift in belief distributions
- Social intelligence benchmarks: Critical for evaluating performance; quick check: validate results across multiple benchmark datasets

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: LLM -> Bayesian updater -> Intention belief distribution -> Dialogue strategy

Critical path: Each utterance is processed by the LLM, beliefs are updated via Bayesian inference, and the resulting intention distribution informs dialogue strategy selection.

Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational overhead of Bayesian updates for improved social reasoning without requiring additional training. This approach leverages existing LLM capabilities but adds complexity to inference-time processing.

Failure signatures: The framework may struggle with highly ambiguous intentions, adversarial partners, or when prior distributions are poorly calibrated. Performance could degrade if Bayesian updates don't properly incorporate new evidence.

First experiments: 1) Test baseline performance without probabilistic modeling to establish baseline improvement; 2) Evaluate framework with synthetic intention data to validate Bayesian updating; 3) Assess performance degradation with intentionally ambiguous partner utterances.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single benchmark (SOTOPIA), limiting generalizability to other social interaction scenarios
- The claim of slightly surpassing an oracle agent requires statistical validation and may not hold across multiple runs
- The effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of prior distributions and likelihood models, which lack extensive validation across diverse contexts

## Confidence
- Claim: 9.0% improvement on SOTOPIA-All - Medium
- Claim: Framework "slightly surpasses" oracle agent - Medium
- Claim: No parameter training required - High for inference layer, Low regarding implicit training effects

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on multiple social interaction benchmarks to assess generalization beyond SOTOPIA
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the probabilistic intent modeling to quantify its specific contribution
3. Evaluate performance when partner intentions are adversarial or highly ambiguous to stress-test the Bayesian updating mechanism
