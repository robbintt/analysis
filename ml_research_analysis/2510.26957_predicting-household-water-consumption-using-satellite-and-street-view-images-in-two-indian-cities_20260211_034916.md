# Predicting Household Water Consumption Using Satellite and Street View Images in Two Indian Cities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.26957
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26957
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: GSV segmentation with geospatial data achieves 0.55 accuracy in predicting household water consumption, approaching survey-based models at 0.59 accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study demonstrates that publicly available imagery—Google Street View semantic segmentation combined with satellite-derived geospatial covariates—can predict household water consumption in Hubballi-Dharwad, India. Under an ordinal classification framework, the model achieves 0.55 accuracy, closely approaching survey-based benchmarks at 0.59 accuracy. The approach leverages visual proxies from streetscape composition (buildings, vegetation, sky) and geospatial indicators (nightlights, population density, building footprints) to infer consumption patterns without costly household surveys.

## Method Summary
The method combines Google Street View semantic segmentation with satellite-derived geospatial covariates to predict household water consumption. Images are processed through EfficientNet-B0 for visual embeddings and ResNet50-dilated for pixel-level segmentation proportions. These features are joined with nightlight intensity, population density, and building footprint data, then classified using LightGBM with ordinal loss. The model operates on 24,366 households in Hubballi-Dharwad, predicting consumption across four tiers (0-8, 8-15, 15-25, >25 KL/month).

## Key Results
- GSV segmentation plus geospatial features achieves 0.55 accuracy for water consumption prediction
- Model performance approaches survey-based benchmarks at 0.59 accuracy
- Error analysis reveals high precision for extreme consumption levels but confusion among middle classes
- Nighttime lights, population density, and building square footage emerge as top three predictive features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GSV semantic segmentation captures visual proxies that correlate with household water consumption through the built environment
- Mechanism: Street-level imagery → pixel-level object classification (buildings, walls, vegetation, sky) → proportion-based feature vectors → gradient boosting classifier → ordinal consumption class
- Core assumption: Exterior visual features reliably proxy household-level infrastructure and behavioral patterns that determine water consumption
- Evidence anchors: GSV segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy); For water consumption, this configuration attains competitive performance (accuracy 0.55, ROC-AUC 0.79); Related work demonstrates GSV-based socioeconomic inference in urban settings
- Break condition: Dense vegetation occlusion, mixed-use zoning where residential exteriors do not reflect internal infrastructure, or informal settlements with ambiguous visual signatures

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population density, building footprints) provide stronger predictive signal than raw image embeddings alone
- Mechanism: Remote sensing data → raster/vector processing → location-aligned numeric features → concatenated with segmentation features → LightGBM ordinal classifier
- Core assumption: Aggregated geospatial proxies at household coordinates reflect individual consumption behavior rather than just neighborhood-level averages
- Evidence anchors: Nighttime lights, population density, and building square footage emerged as the top three contributors; Among the image-based features, satellite-derived nightlight intensity and building footprint showed strong associations with both water consumption and income levels
- Break condition: Low-luminosity regions where nightlights are uniformly minimal; high-rise buildings where footprint area poorly correlates with household count

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ordinal classification preserves consumption-tier ordering, improving accuracy over nominal multiclass approaches
- Mechanism: Consumption brackets → sequence of binary classifiers (threshold at each boundary) → probability reconstruction via conditional chaining → final class assignment
- Core assumption: The underlying consumption distribution is smoothly ordered with monotonic feature relationships across class boundaries
- Evidence anchors: The ordinal loss function decomposes the multiclass problem into a sequence of binary subproblems; Error analysis shows high precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies
- Break condition: Non-monotonic feature effects (e.g., middle-income households in mixed-use buildings with commercial water access showing higher consumption than high-income households in apartments with shared meters)

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transfer learning with CNNs (EfficientNet-B0)**
  - Why needed here: Extracts 256-dimensional visual embeddings from satellite/GSV images without training from scratch, leveraging ImageNet-learned features for urban scene representation
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why global average pooling followed by a linear projection reduces overfitting compared to using raw convolutional feature maps?

- **Concept: Semantic segmentation with ADE20K**
  - Why needed here: Converts unstructured street imagery into interpretable, quantifiable object proportions (e.g., 23% building, 15% vegetation) that serve as model inputs
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, and why does this study use the latter?

- **Concept: SMOTE for class imbalance**
  - Why needed here: Water consumption classes are imbalanced (middle tiers dominant, extremes rare); SMOTE synthetically augments minority classes to improve classifier calibration
  - Quick check question: Why does SMOTE interpolate between minority samples rather than simply duplicating them, and what risk does this introduce for overfitting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Geo-coordinate extraction → API call orchestration → image download → EfficientNet-B0 embeddings → ADE20K segmentation → geospatial join → SMOTE oversampling → LightGBM ordinal training → 5-fold CV evaluation

- **Critical path:** 1. Geo-coordinate extraction from survey → API call orchestration → image download; 2. Parallel feature extraction (embeddings + segmentation + geospatial join); 3. Feature concatenation → SMOTE oversampling → LightGBM ordinal training; 4. Validation: accuracy + ROC-AUC across income and water consumption tasks

- **Design tradeoffs:** Frozen vs. fine-tuned CNN: Authors use frozen weights for scalability; fine-tuning could improve domain adaptation but requires labeled imagery; Segmentation proportions vs. raw embeddings: Segmentation provides interpretability; embeddings capture latent features but are opaque; GSV-only vs. multimodal: GSV alone underperforms; adding geospatial covariates closes gap to survey benchmarks

- **Failure signatures:** High confusion in middle consumption tiers (8–25 KL): Feature distributions overlap, especially population density and nightlights; Dense vegetation occlusion: Segmentation outputs dominated by "vegetation" class, suppressing building/infrastructure signals; Mixed-use zones: Commercial proximity inflates nightlights without corresponding residential consumption

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Baseline replication: Reproduce the GSV segmentation + geospatial feature set on a held-out 20% split; confirm ~0.55 accuracy and analyze per-class precision/recall; 2. Ablation study: Train models with (a) geospatial features only, (b) GSV segmentation only, (c) combined; quantify marginal contribution of each modality; 3. Error cluster analysis: Spatially cluster misclassified households by ward-level aggregates; test whether adding neighborhood-level priors reduces boundary confusion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can incorporating spatial clustering or neighborhood-level priors reduce the misclassification of households in middle-income and mid-consumption brackets?
- **Open Question 2:** Does refining semantic segmentation to target specific infrastructure (e.g., water tanks, rooftops) improve the prediction of household water consumption?
- **Open Question 3:** To what extent do these image-based models generalize to other cities with diverse urban morphologies?

## Limitations
- Small dataset scope: 24,366 households in a single Indian city limits generalizability to other urban contexts
- Ordinal classification assumption: Assumes monotonic feature-class relationships that may not hold in mixed-use or informal settlements
- Geospatial feature quality: Relies on publicly available datasets whose resolution and accuracy may vary by region
- Imagery bias: GSV coverage may be incomplete or biased toward certain neighborhoods

## Confidence
- **High:** The methodological pipeline (GSV segmentation + geospatial features → LightGBM ordinal) is technically sound and well-documented
- **Medium:** The claim that open-access imagery can approximate survey-based water consumption estimates is supported but limited to a single city context
- **Low:** Generalization to other cities or countries without recalibration remains uncertain due to reliance on city-specific visual and socioeconomic patterns

## Next Checks
1. Cross-city replication: Apply the same pipeline to a different Indian city or similar urban setting to test generalizability of the GSV+geospatial approach
2. Mixed-use zone analysis: Stratify error analysis by land-use type (residential vs. commercial-mixed) to quantify model breakdown in ambiguous visual contexts
3. Feature importance stability: Perform leave-one-feature-out experiments to assess which geospatial or segmentation features are critical across different consumption tiers
