# SEDformer: Event-Synchronous Spiking Transformers for Irregular Telemetry Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.02230
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02230
- Authors: Ziyu Zhou, Yuchen Fang, Weilin Ruan, Shiyu Wang, James Kwok, Yuxuan Liang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art forecasting accuracy on irregular telemetry datasets with >80× lower theoretical energy consumption compared to leading baselines

## Executive Summary
SEDformer introduces a spiking transformer architecture designed specifically for irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) forecasting. By aligning computation to observed events rather than padded uniform grids, it achieves both superior forecasting accuracy and dramatic energy efficiency gains. The model uses Event-Aligned LIF neurons that condition membrane decay on actual inter-event intervals, enabling accurate modeling of irregular time patterns while preserving the sparsity inherent in telemetry data.

## Method Summary
SEDformer processes irregular time series by converting observations into event-synchronous spike trains through a Spike Event Encoder with Event-Aligned LIF neurons. A temporal downsampling module compresses long gaps while preserving salient events, followed by membrane-based linear attention that models dependencies efficiently. The architecture is trained end-to-end using surrogate gradient methods and evaluated on web-traffic datasets under various sparsity levels. Key innovations include interval-dependent neuron decay, event-aligned computation, and linear attention with membrane features.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (HyperIMTS, KAFNet, etc.) on Wiki2000 and WikiArticle datasets across 25%, 50%, and 75% sparsity levels
- Achieves over 80× theoretical energy reduction compared to baselines based on 45nm digital cost model
- Ablation studies show EA-LIF neurons and event-synchronous computation are critical for performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Event-Aligned LIF neurons enable accurate modeling of irregular time intervals by conditioning membrane decay on actual inter-event gaps rather than fixed timesteps. Standard LIF neurons use constant leak coefficient per step, which assumes uniform sampling. EA-LIF replaces this with interval-dependent decay: β^l[t_k] = exp(-Δt_k/τ^l). When Δt_k is large (long silence), β^l[t_k] → 0, causing strong decay and preventing stale information from accumulating. When Δt_k is small (dense burst), β^l[t_k] → 1, preserving temporal continuity. This makes the neuron's memory state explicitly aware of elapsed time between observations.

### Mechanism 2
Event-synchronous spike encoding preserves sparse event semantics while avoiding the computational inflation caused by zero-padding to uniform grids. The SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw IMTS observations into spike trains only at observed event times rather than a padded uniform grid. This exploits the Sparsity-Event Duality: long stretches have sparse/no observations, dense bursts contain most semantic events. By computing only when events occur, the model avoids forcing computation at non-informative padded steps and preserves the semantic meaning of actual observation timing.

### Mechanism 3
Membrane-based linear attention enables O(K') complexity dependency modeling while remaining interval-aware through EA-LIF feature transformations. SED-Attention applies EA-LIF transformations to queries and keys, producing non-negative features that encode interval information. The linear attention kernel trick computes output via pre-aggregated terms, yielding O(K'Hd_h²) complexity instead of O(K'²) for standard attention. Critically, attention scores depend on inter-event intervals on the pooled grid, emphasizing recent dense events and down-weighting attention across long silences.

## Foundational Learning

- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neurons**: Understanding integration, leakage, thresholding, and reset is prerequisite to grasping how interval-conditioning modifies dynamics. Quick check: Given α = 0.5, if membrane potential v[t-1] = 0.6 and input x[t] = 0.4, what is the pre-spike membrane potential m[t] before thresholding?

- **Surrogate Gradient Training**: The Heaviside step function in spike generation has undefined gradients; surrogate gradients enable backpropagation through discrete spikes. Quick check: Why can't gradients flow through a Heaviside function directly, and what property must a surrogate function satisfy?

- **Linear Attention / Kernel Trick**: SED-Attention achieves O(K') complexity by decomposing attention into Σ φ(k)^T v and Σ φ(k)^T terms. Quick check: In standard attention, complexity is O(n²d) for n queries and n keys. How does the kernel trick φ(q)^T φ(k) with pre-aggregation reduce this to O(nd²)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw IMTS (T, X, M) → [SED-SE] → Conv1×k → log-gate (interval) → EA-LIF → Event-synchronous spikes S ∈ R^{K×D×C} → [EPTD] → MaxPool(stride s) → Compressed spikes S' ∈ R^{K'×D×C}, pooled timestamps T' → [SED-ST blocks × L] → Embedding + Time Encoding → SED-Attention (EA-LIF Q/K) + FFN → X^{(L)} ∈ R^{K'×D×d} → [MTA] → Masked aggregation over events → z[d] ∈ R^d per variate → [Decoder] → MLP(z_j ⊕ TE(q_j^r)) → Predictions x̂_j^r

- Critical path: **EA-LIF interval conditioning** → If β^l[t_k] computation is incorrect (e.g., using wrong Δt, not normalizing by τ^l, or not masking unobserved steps), the entire event-synchronous property fails, causing both accuracy loss and efficiency degradation. The time constant τ^l = softplus(η^l) + 1 must remain positive and learnable.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Pooling stride (EPTD)**: Smaller stride preserves more event detail but increases K' and compute; larger stride compresses aggressively but may remove short bursts. Paper finds stride 4-8 optimal.
  - **Number of SED-ST blocks**: Deeper improves representation but saturates quickly; L=1-2 often sufficient.
  - **Time constant τ**: Too small over-reacts to noise in bursts; too large retains stale context across gaps.
  - **Spiking vs. dense tensors**: Theoretical energy savings require sparsity-aware runtimes; dense GPU backends may not realize full gains.

- Failure signatures:
  - **All-zero spikes**: Threshold v_th too high or input scaling misconfigured; neurons never fire.
  - **No accuracy gain over baselines on dense data**: Expected—SED advantage requires actual sparsity; verify dataset has irregular gaps.
  - **Gradients NaN/Inf**: Surrogate gradient slope α_ste too steep, or membrane potentials exploding; check normalization in SED-Attention.
  - **Energy not improving**: Spike firing rate ρ_ℓ too high; SEDformer still computes at most steps. Verify EPTD is active and stride > 1.
  - **Prediction ignores long gaps**: Decay β^l[t_k] may not be applied correctly; confirm Δt_k is actual elapsed time, not just step index.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Validate EA-LIF decay behavior**: Create synthetic IMTS with known gaps; verify membrane potential decays as exp(-Δt/τ) between events and that long silences produce near-zero states while dense bursts accumulate. Visualize spike trains.
  2. **Ablation study replication**: Run SEDformer with/without EA-LIF, with/without EPTD, and with/without SED-Attention. Compare MSE/MAE on Wiki2000 at 50% sparsifying rate; expect largest degradation from SED-ST removal.
  3. **Efficiency scaling analysis**: Measure SOPs/FLOPs and theoretical energy across sparsifying rates (25%, 50%, 75%) on both Wiki datasets. Verify that SEDformer's advantage increases with sparsity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can theoretical energy reduction be realized on actual neuromorphic hardware?** The authors plan to explore deployment on low-power hardware and neuromorphic backends to further translate spike sparsity into practical efficiency gains. Current energy results are theoretical estimations based on a 45nm digital cost model, not measured consumption on physical hardware.

- **How does SEDformer perform under Missing Not at Random (MNAR) mechanisms?** The model can behave suboptimally under MNAR or structured censoring because training and evaluation primarily assume MCAR-style sparsity. The experimental protocol artificially induces sparsity via independent random masking, which may not reflect real-world telemetry where missingness correlates with system states or events.

- **Can SEDformer be adapted for online learning to handle streaming telemetry data with distribution shift?** The authors list studying online learning for streaming settings with distribution shift as a primary direction for future work. The current architecture utilizes an offline sequence-to-sequence training objective and lacks mechanisms to update weights dynamically during inference as data statistics change.

## Limitations
- Energy efficiency claims are theoretical based on digital cost models rather than measured hardware consumption
- Performance under MNAR missingness patterns remains unexplored, limiting real-world applicability
- No mechanism for online learning or adaptation to streaming data with distribution shift

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| State-of-the-art accuracy on IMTS forecasting | High |
| >80× theoretical energy reduction | High (theoretical basis well-defined) |
| Event-synchronous computation advantage requires actual sparsity | High |
| Linear attention approximation sufficient for most cases | Medium (some long-range dependencies may require quadratic attention) |

## Next Checks

1. **Verify EA-LIF interval decay implementation**: Create synthetic time series with controlled gaps and confirm membrane potentials decay exponentially with actual elapsed time, not step count.

2. **Replicate ablation study results**: Systematically remove EA-LIF, EPTD, and SED-Attention components individually and measure performance degradation on Wiki2000 at 50% sparsity.

3. **Validate energy efficiency scaling**: Measure computational complexity and theoretical energy consumption across different sparsity levels (25%, 50%, 75%) to confirm energy advantage increases with sparsity.
