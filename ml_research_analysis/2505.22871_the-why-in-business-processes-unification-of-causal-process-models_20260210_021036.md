# The WHY in Business Processes: Unification of Causal Process Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22871
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22871
- Reference count: 40
- Addresses unification of causal process models from event logs with missing data and alternating causal conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the fundamental challenge in process mining of unifying multiple causal process models discovered from event logs that contain missing data and alternating causal conditions. The authors extend causal process graphs with gating mechanisms (AND, OR, XOR, and exhaustive OR gateways) to explicitly represent complex alternative execution paths and alternating causal relationships. By partitioning event logs to avoid missing data issues, applying causal discovery within each partition, and then unifying results using a matrix-based algorithm, the approach enables comprehensive modeling of business processes with incomplete information.

## Method Summary
The method addresses the unification problem by first splitting event logs into partitions based on alternating causal conditions to eliminate missing data issues. Within each partition, causal discovery algorithms identify process models. The unification algorithm then merges these models using a matrix-based approach that identifies gateway types (AND, OR, XOR, exhaustive OR) based on the relationship between causal and anti-causal dependencies. This systematic approach captures both alternative execution paths and explicitly represents alternating causal relationships through the extended gating mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Scalability validated across five datasets (three open, two proprietary) with computation times ranging from 0.26 to 118.89 seconds
- Polynomial relationships between activity count and computation time confirmed (cubic: R² = .9209-.9781)
- Correctness of the unification algorithm formally proven
- Practical applicability demonstrated for real-world process mining scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by systematically addressing two core challenges in process mining: missing data and alternating causal conditions. By partitioning event logs, it eliminates missing data within each partition, enabling reliable causal discovery. The matrix-based unification algorithm captures complex process behaviors by identifying gateway types through the relationship between causal and anti-causal dependencies. The extended gating mechanisms provide explicit representation of alternative execution paths and alternating causal relationships, enabling comprehensive process modeling.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event log partitioning** - needed to eliminate missing data within partitions; quick check: verify partitions contain sufficient complete traces
- **Causal discovery algorithms** - needed to identify process models within each partition; quick check: validate discovered models match known process behaviors
- **Matrix-based unification** - needed to systematically merge multiple models; quick check: confirm gateway identification accuracy through known test cases
- **Gateway mechanism extension** - needed to represent complex causal relationships; quick check: validate that all alternative execution paths are captured
- **Alternating causal conditions** - needed to handle process variants; quick check: ensure partitions correctly separate different causal scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Event Log -> Partitioner -> Multiple Causal Discoverers -> Matrix-Based Unifier -> Unified Causal Process Model

**Critical Path:** The most critical path is Partitioner -> Multiple Causal Discoverers -> Matrix-Based Unifier, as errors in partitioning or discovery directly impact unification quality. The partitioning step is crucial because it determines the quality of causal discovery within each partition.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The approach trades computational complexity (cubic relationship with activity count) for comprehensive modeling capability. The partitioning strategy assumes clean separation of alternating causal conditions, which may not always be feasible. Using multiple causal discovery runs increases accuracy but also computational cost.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor partitioning leads to incomplete or inaccurate causal discovery within partitions. Matrix-based unification may fail to correctly identify gateway types when causal relationships are ambiguous or noisy. Performance degradation occurs when activity counts exceed practical limits due to cubic complexity.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test partitioning accuracy on synthetic event logs with known alternating causal conditions
2. Validate gateway identification accuracy using controlled test cases with predetermined gateway types
3. Measure scalability by running the algorithm on progressively larger synthetic datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on proprietary datasets with unknown ground truth, limiting rigorous validation
- Cubic time complexity may become prohibitive for very large process models with hundreds of activities
- Assumes clean separation of alternating causal conditions into partitions, which may not hold in all real-world scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Correctness of the unification algorithm (formally proven)
- Matrix-based gateway identification approach
- Observed polynomial time complexity relationships

**Medium Confidence:**
- Practical applicability across diverse datasets
- Effectiveness of gating mechanisms in capturing complex process behaviors

**Low Confidence:**
- Generalizability to extremely large-scale processes
- Robustness when alternating causal conditions cannot be cleanly separated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments using synthetic datasets with known ground truth to systematically evaluate model accuracy across varying complexity and data quality levels
2. Test the algorithm's performance on processes with more than 100 activities to validate cubic complexity assumption and identify potential bottlenecks
3. Investigate alternative partitioning strategies for cases where alternating causal conditions cannot be cleanly separated, such as overlapping conditions or hierarchical relationships
