core_contribution: The paper introduces FoG, a method that leverages foundation models
  to guide unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning. Unlike prior methods
  that maximize skill diversity without considering human preferences, FoG uses foundation
  models to evaluate states based on human intentions, assigning higher scores to
  desirable states and lower to undesirable ones.

# Guiding Skill Discovery with Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.23167
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23167
- Authors: Zhao Yang; Thomas M. Moerland; Mike Preuss; Aske Plaat; Vincent François-Lavet; Edward S. Hu

- Primary result: FoG uses foundation models to guide unsupervised skill discovery by re-weighting rewards based on human preferences, outperforming 6 baselines on state and pixel-based tasks.

## Executive Summary
FoG introduces a novel method for incorporating human intentions into unsupervised skill discovery by leveraging foundation models to score states. Unlike traditional approaches that maximize skill diversity without considering human preferences, FoG assigns higher scores to desirable states and lower scores to undesirable ones, then uses these scores to re-weight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms. The method is evaluated on both state-based and pixel-based tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art baselines by eliminating undesirable behaviors and aligning skills with specific intentions.

## Method Summary
FoG integrates foundation models into the skill discovery pipeline by using them as evaluators of state desirability. The foundation model provides a score function that rates each state based on human intentions, with higher scores for desirable states and lower scores for undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the intrinsic rewards generated by skill discovery algorithms, effectively biasing the skill learning process toward behaviors that align with human preferences. This approach maintains the unsupervised nature of skill discovery while incorporating human guidance, resulting in diverse skills that are both varied and aligned with specific intentions.

## Key Results
- FoG successfully eliminates undesirable behaviors like flipping in HalfCheetah and hazardous area avoidance in Ant
- In pixel-based tasks, FoG learns diverse skills while avoiding hazardous areas in Cheetah and Quadruped
- FoG discovers complex behaviors such as "twisted" postures in Humanoid that are difficult to define explicitly
- The method demonstrates robustness to noise in the score function and performs well even with imperfect scoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper doesn't provide a detailed mechanism section explaining why this approach works. The method relies on the foundation model's ability to generalize across states and provide meaningful scores that correlate with human preferences, but the specific mechanisms by which this generalization occurs are not elaborated.

## Foundational Learning
- **Foundation Models**: Pre-trained models that can generalize across diverse tasks and provide meaningful evaluations of states based on human intentions.
  - Why needed: To provide a generalizable score function that can evaluate states across different tasks and environments
  - Quick check: Test the foundation model's ability to consistently score similar states similarly across different environments

- **Skill Discovery in RL**: Unsupervised methods for learning diverse behaviors without external rewards
  - Why needed: To generate a broad repertoire of skills that can be used for downstream tasks
  - Quick check: Verify that the base skill discovery algorithm generates diverse skills before adding the score function

- **Reward Re-weighting**: Adjusting the magnitude of rewards based on external criteria
  - Why needed: To bias the skill learning process toward behaviors that align with human preferences
  - Quick check: Test how different re-weighting schemes affect the final skill distribution

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Foundation Model -> Score Function -> Reward Re-weighting -> Skill Discovery Algorithm

**Critical Path**: The foundation model evaluates states and provides scores, which are then used to re-weight the intrinsic rewards from the skill discovery algorithm. This re-weighted reward signal guides the learning process toward skills that are both diverse and aligned with human intentions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades pure diversity maximization for intention-alignment, potentially sacrificing some exploration for more human-relevant skills. The quality of the foundation model's scores directly impacts the final skill quality, creating a dependency on model performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor foundation model scores lead to suboptimal skill discovery, with the algorithm learning skills that don't align with human intentions. Over-reliance on the score function can reduce exploration and lead to premature convergence on limited skill sets.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test FoG on a simple grid-world task with clearly defined good and bad states to verify basic functionality
2. Compare skill diversity with and without score function re-weighting to quantify the impact on exploration
3. Evaluate robustness by adding noise to the foundation model scores and measuring degradation in skill quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance depends heavily on the quality and specificity of the foundation model's ability to distinguish between desirable and undesirable states
- The method requires access to a foundation model that can be adapted to the specific domain, which may not always be available
- Limited quantitative analysis of robustness to noisy score functions and unclear threshold for useful scoring

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology of using foundation models to score states and re-weight skill discovery rewards is technically sound and well-motivated.

**Medium confidence**: The claim of outperforming six state-of-the-art baselines is supported by results, but evaluation focuses on specific task types and may not generalize broadly.

**Low confidence**: Claims about robustness to noisy score functions lack quantitative analysis, and the threshold at which foundation model scores become too noisy is not established.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of foundation model score noise on final skill quality, systematically varying noise levels

2. Test FoG on tasks where human intentions conflict (e.g., balancing exploration with safety) to evaluate how well it handles competing objectives

3. Evaluate transfer performance by training foundation models on one task distribution and applying FoG to a different but related task distribution to assess generalization capabilities
