# The Trajectory Bundle Method: Unifying Sequential-Convex Programming and Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.26575
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26575
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: TBM unifies derivative-free sampling-based methods with sequential convex programming for trajectory optimization, achieving strong constraint satisfaction and optimality comparable to traditional methods while naturally handling nonsmooth dynamics and black-box models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Trajectory Bundle Method (TBM), a unified framework that bridges sequential convex programming and sampling-based trajectory optimization. TBM approximates nonlinear cost and constraint functions by sampling nearby trajectories and linearly interpolating between them, rather than using derivative-based Taylor series expansions. This derivative-free approach naturally handles problems where derivatives are unavailable, expensive, or unreliable, such as with learned dynamics models or contact-rich systems. The method generalizes sample-based methods like MPPI control to support multiple shooting, arbitrary constraints, and general trajectory optimization problems.

## Method Summary
The Trajectory Bundle Method reformulates trajectory optimization as a sequential convex programming problem where cost and constraint functions are approximated using linear interpolation between sampled trajectories. At each iteration, the algorithm samples perturbations around the current trajectory, evaluates the nonlinear functions at these sample points, and constructs piecewise-linear approximations. These approximations are then used to solve a convex subproblem that generates an improved trajectory. The process iterates until convergence, with the sampling strategy adapting to focus on regions of high uncertainty or constraint violation. This approach combines the global exploration benefits of sampling methods with the local convergence properties of sequential convex programming.

## Key Results
- TBM achieves strong constraint satisfaction and optimality comparable to traditional derivative-based methods on benchmark problems
- The method successfully handles nonsmooth dynamics and black-box models without requiring analytical derivatives
- Demonstrated effectiveness on challenging robotics problems including collision avoidance, aggressive quadrotor tracking, and autonomous racing
- Natural integration with learned dynamics models while maintaining robust convergence properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TBM works by leveraging the geometric interpretation of trajectory optimization as finding the intersection of constraint manifolds in trajectory space. By sampling trajectories and constructing piecewise-linear approximations, the method creates a convex feasible region that contains the true feasible set. The linear interpolation between samples provides a conservative approximation that ensures feasibility while allowing for efficient convex optimization. The sampling strategy focuses computational effort where it matters most - near constraint boundaries and regions of high nonlinearity - while maintaining global exploration capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
**Trajectory optimization basics**: Understanding how to formulate optimal control problems as constrained optimization over trajectories (why needed: core problem setup; quick check: can derive Euler-Lagrange equations for simple systems)
**Sequential convex programming**: Knowledge of how to iteratively solve nonconvex problems by convexifying around current solutions (why needed: TBM builds on SCP framework; quick check: understand trust region methods)
**Sampling-based control**: Familiarity with methods like MPPI that use trajectory sampling for control (why needed: TBM generalizes these approaches; quick check: implement basic MPPI on linear system)
**Convex optimization**: Strong grasp of convex problem formulations and solution methods (why needed: each TBM iteration solves a convex subproblem; quick check: solve simple QP with constraints)
**Piecewise-linear approximation**: Understanding how linear interpolation creates convex approximations of nonlinear functions (why needed: core approximation mechanism in TBM; quick check: verify convexity of interpolated functions)

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Trajectory sampler -> Function evaluator -> Linear interpolator -> Convex solver -> Trajectory updater -> Convergence checker
**Critical path**: Initial trajectory -> Sampling loop -> Function evaluation -> Approximation construction -> Convex subproblem solution -> Trajectory update -> Convergence check -> Output
**Design tradeoffs**: Sampling density vs. computational cost, interpolation order vs. approximation accuracy, trust region size vs. convergence speed
**Failure signatures**: Poor constraint satisfaction indicates insufficient sampling near boundaries; slow convergence suggests overly conservative trust regions; divergence may indicate inadequate linear approximations
**First experiments**: 1) Simple linear system with known solution to verify basic functionality, 2) Nonlinear pendulum with analytic gradients to compare against SQP, 3) Contact-rich cartpole to test nonsmooth dynamics handling

## Next Checks
1) Benchmark TBM against traditional SQP methods on a suite of smooth, high-dimensional trajectory optimization problems
2) Test the method with learned dynamics models that have significant prediction uncertainty
