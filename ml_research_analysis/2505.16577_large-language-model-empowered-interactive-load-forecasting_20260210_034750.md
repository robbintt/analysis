- This paper presents a large language model-based multi-agent collaboration framework to support interactive load forecasting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a large language model-based multi-agent collaboration framework for interactive load forecasting that reduces technical barriers for non-expert users. The framework enables natural language interaction throughout the entire forecasting pipeline, from data preparation to model deployment and post-processing. Specialized agents handle distinct stages while communicating via a topic-based messaging system, allowing users to incorporate domain knowledge and contextual insights. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that interactive human guidance improves forecasting accuracy compared to automated approaches, with practical token costs supporting real-world deployment feasibility.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a multi-agent system where specialized agents handle distinct stages of the load forecasting pipeline. Agents communicate through a topic-based messaging system, enabling seamless coordination between data preparation, model selection, and post-processing tasks. The natural language interface allows users to interact with the system using conversational commands, making advanced forecasting capabilities accessible to non-technical users. The architecture supports iterative refinement where human feedback can be incorporated at multiple stages to improve forecast accuracy.

## Key Results
- Interactive human guidance improves forecasting accuracy compared to automated approaches
- Framework achieves lower mean absolute errors on two real-world datasets
- Practical token costs support real-world deployment feasibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from combining LLM capabilities with multi-agent collaboration. Each agent specializes in a specific forecasting stage (data preparation, model selection, post-processing), allowing focused expertise while maintaining overall system coherence through topic-based messaging. Natural language interaction reduces the technical barrier for non-expert users to leverage sophisticated forecasting techniques. The iterative refinement process allows domain knowledge and contextual insights to be incorporated, addressing the limitations of purely automated approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-agent systems**: Why needed - to distribute complex forecasting tasks across specialized components; Quick check - verify each agent handles its designated stage effectively
**Topic-based messaging**: Why needed - to enable coordinated communication between agents without centralized control; Quick check - ensure messages reach appropriate agents and maintain task flow
**Natural language interfaces**: Why needed - to make advanced forecasting accessible to non-technical users; Quick check - test system response to various user input phrasings
**Load forecasting fundamentals**: Why needed - to understand the specific requirements and challenges of electricity demand prediction; Quick check - verify framework addresses key forecasting challenges like seasonality and weather impacts
**Iterative refinement**: Why needed - to incorporate human domain knowledge and improve forecast accuracy; Quick check - measure accuracy improvement with each human interaction cycle

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: User Interface -> Natural Language Processor -> Topic Router -> Data Preparation Agent -> Model Selection Agent -> Post-processing Agent -> Result Generator

**Critical path**: User query → Natural language processing → Agent selection via topic routing → Task execution by specialized agent → Result generation and feedback loop

**Design tradeoffs**: Centralized vs. distributed control (chosen: distributed with messaging), fully automated vs. interactive (chosen: interactive), complex vs. simple user interface (chosen: natural language simplicity)

**Failure signatures**: Agent communication breakdown (detected via message timeout), incorrect task routing (detected via output validation), natural language misinterpretation (detected via confidence scores)

**First 3 experiments**: 1) Test basic load forecasting accuracy on clean dataset, 2) Evaluate system response to natural language queries with domain-specific terminology, 3) Measure accuracy improvement with iterative human feedback

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Experimental evaluation relies on only two real-world datasets, limiting generalizability
- Framework architecture details lack specification of computational requirements and scalability considerations
- Insufficient discussion of error handling mechanisms and performance under varying data quality conditions

## Confidence

High confidence in the core claim that interactive human guidance improves forecasting accuracy over automated approaches, supported by empirical results showing lower mean absolute errors. Medium confidence in the practical token cost assessment, as the paper provides cost metrics but lacks detailed breakdown by forecasting stage and does not address long-term cost implications for continuous deployment. Low confidence in the framework's robustness claims due to insufficient discussion of edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and performance under varying data quality conditions.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct stress testing of the multi-agent messaging system under high-frequency data streams and concurrent user interactions to evaluate scalability and latency characteristics.
2. Expand experimental validation across multiple geographic regions and grid configurations using diverse datasets to assess generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations.
3. Implement comprehensive error handling and fault tolerance testing to evaluate framework resilience when facing incomplete data, network interruptions, or agent failures during live forecasting operations.
