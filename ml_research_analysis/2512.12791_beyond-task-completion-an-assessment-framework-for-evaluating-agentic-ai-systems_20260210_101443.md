# Beyond Task Completion: An Assessment Framework for Evaluating Agentic AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.12791
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12791
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Conventional task completion metrics fail to capture behavioral uncertainties in agentic AI systems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of evaluating agentic AI systems, which combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. The authors identify that conventional evaluation methods relying on binary task completion metrics fail to capture the behavioral uncertainties introduced by the non-deterministic nature of AI models. To address this, they propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars: LLM, Memory, Tools, and Environment. The framework integrates static, dynamic, and judge-based evaluation modes to assess instruction following, safety alignment, memory operations, tool orchestration, and environmental interactions.

Experiments on a CloudOps use case demonstrate that while baseline metrics report task completion, the framework reveals substantial behavioral failures—particularly in tool orchestration (7.67 average failures in multi-agent scenarios) and memory retrieval (recall as low as 13.1% in some cases). Judge-based evaluations further uncovered safety violations and policy non-compliance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties that conventional methods miss.

## Method Summary
The authors propose an Agent Assessment Framework that evaluates agentic AI systems through four pillars: LLM (instruction following, safety alignment), Memory (storage, retrieval, context management), Tools (orchestration, integration, failure handling), and Environment (real-world interaction, state changes). The framework combines three evaluation modes: static testing (pre-deployment verification), dynamic testing (runtime behavior analysis), and judge-based evaluation (human or LLM assessment of outputs). The framework was applied to a CloudOps use case involving infrastructure provisioning and scaling tasks.

## Key Results
- Tool orchestration failures averaged 7.67 in multi-agent scenarios despite reported task completion
- Memory recall rates dropped as low as 13.1% in some cases, revealing critical performance gaps
- Judge-based evaluations identified safety violations and policy non-compliance not captured by conventional metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically decomposing agentic AI evaluation into four operational domains (LLM, Memory, Tools, Environment) and applying appropriate testing modes to each. Static testing verifies baseline capabilities before deployment, dynamic testing captures runtime behaviors and edge cases, and judge-based evaluation provides qualitative assessment of safety and compliance. This multi-modal approach addresses the inherent non-determinism of agentic systems by evaluating both expected behaviors and emergent failure modes.

## Foundational Learning
**Agentic AI Systems** - AI systems that combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform autonomous tasks. Needed to understand the complexity beyond single-model evaluation. Quick check: Can identify the three core components beyond the LLM in any agentic system description.

**Behavioral Uncertainty** - The unpredictable variations in AI system outputs due to non-deterministic model behavior and environmental interactions. Needed to justify why conventional binary metrics are insufficient. Quick check: Can explain how two identical inputs might produce different outputs in agentic systems.

**Multi-modal Evaluation** - Using different testing approaches (static, dynamic, judge-based) to comprehensively assess system behavior. Needed to understand why no single evaluation method suffices. Quick check: Can map each evaluation mode to the types of failures it detects.

**Tool Orchestration** - The coordination and management of multiple tools and agents working together. Needed to understand the complexity in multi-agent scenarios. Quick check: Can identify potential failure points when multiple tools interact.

**Memory Operations** - The processes of storing, retrieving, and managing contextual information in agentic systems. Needed to evaluate the system's ability to maintain context. Quick check: Can distinguish between successful storage and successful retrieval operations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: LLM -> Memory -> Tools -> Environment -> LLM (feedback loop)

**Critical Path**: Input → LLM Processing → Memory Context Retrieval → Tool Selection/Orchestration → Environment Interaction → Output Generation → Judge Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes comprehensive behavioral coverage over evaluation speed, accepting that multi-modal testing increases assessment time but provides more accurate behavioral insights. This tradeoff is justified by the high-stakes nature of agentic AI failures in enterprise contexts.

**Failure Signatures**: Tool orchestration failures manifest as cascading errors across multiple agents, memory retrieval failures appear as context loss and repeated mistakes, safety violations emerge as policy violations in judge-based evaluation, and environment failures show as incorrect state changes or incomplete operations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply framework to a simple single-agent task to validate baseline measurements
2. Test tool orchestration with increasing numbers of tools to identify scaling limits
3. Evaluate memory operations under stress conditions (high context volume, rapid switching)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond the CloudOps use case to other agentic AI contexts
- Framework may not fully capture emergent behaviors in complex multi-agent interactions
- Judge-based evaluations are subjective and may lack consistency across different evaluators

## Confidence
High - Conventional task completion metrics are insufficient for agentic AI systems
Medium - Framework effectively captures runtime uncertainties
Low - Framework generalizability and scalability to larger systems

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to at least two additional domains (e.g., healthcare, autonomous vehicles) to test generalizability and identify domain-specific challenges
2. Conduct a longitudinal study with continuous deployment of the framework to assess its ability to detect and adapt to evolving agentic behaviors over time
3. Perform a large-scale multi-agent simulation to evaluate the framework's performance under high concurrency and complex interaction scenarios, measuring scalability and robustness
