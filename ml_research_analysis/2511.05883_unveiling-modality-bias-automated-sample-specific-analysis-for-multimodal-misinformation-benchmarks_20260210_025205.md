# Unveiling Modality Bias: Automated Sample-Specific Analysis for Multimodal Misinformation Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.05883
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05883
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Automated sample-specific bias analysis for multimodal misinformation benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical issue of modality bias in multimodal misinformation benchmarks through automated sample-specific analysis. The authors propose three complementary bias quantification methods at different granularities: modality benefit (coarse, Shapley value-based), modality flow (medium, saliency-based attention analysis), and modality causal effect (fine, counterfactual reasoning). A human evaluation on 300 samples from Fakeddit and MMFakeBench demonstrates that ensembling these views (multi-view analysis) achieves 79.33% and 83.33% accuracy respectively, outperforming single-view approaches. The analysis shows vulnerability to detector-induced fluctuations when changing misinformation detectors and higher agreement on modality-balanced samples versus biased ones, suggesting practical potential for cleaning biased benchmarks by retaining modality-balanced samples.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a three-pronged approach to quantifying modality bias in multimodal misinformation benchmarks. The first method, modality benefit, uses Shapley values to assess each modality's contribution to misinformation detection at a coarse level. The second, modality flow, employs saliency-based attention analysis to trace how information flows through the multimodal model at a medium granularity. The third, modality causal effect, leverages counterfactual reasoning to understand fine-grained causal relationships between modalities and detection outcomes. These methods are integrated through a multi-view analysis framework that combines the complementary perspectives. The human evaluation involved annotators assessing sample-specific bias using the combined methodology across two benchmark datasets.

## Key Results
- Multi-view analysis (ensembling three bias quantification methods) achieves 79.33% accuracy on Fakeddit and 83.33% on MMFakeBench
- Bias analysis is vulnerable to detector-induced fluctuations when changing misinformation detectors
- Modality-balanced samples show higher agreement between analysis methods compared to biased samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by providing complementary perspectives on modality bias at different granularities. The Shapley value-based approach captures global importance, attention analysis reveals local information flow patterns, and counterfactual reasoning establishes causal relationships. By combining these views, the system can identify consistent bias patterns while mitigating individual method limitations. The vulnerability to detector fluctuations suggests that bias analysis is inherently tied to the specific detector architecture and training, highlighting the importance of considering detector choice in benchmark analysis.

## Foundational Learning
- **Shapley values for feature attribution** - why needed: To quantify each modality's contribution to detection; quick check: Verify attribution sums to total detection score
- **Attention-based saliency mapping** - why needed: To trace information flow through multimodal models; quick check: Confirm saliency maps highlight semantically relevant regions
- **Counterfactual reasoning in multimodal models** - why needed: To establish causal relationships between modalities and outcomes; quick check: Validate counterfactuals preserve semantic content
- **Human evaluation methodology** - why needed: To establish ground truth for automated bias analysis; quick check: Assess inter-annotator agreement
- **Ensemble methods for multi-view analysis** - why needed: To combine complementary bias quantification perspectives; quick check: Test whether ensemble outperforms individual methods
- **Benchmark cleaning via sample selection** - why needed: To improve benchmark quality by removing biased samples; quick check: Evaluate cleaned benchmark performance

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Modality Benefit (Shapley) -> Modality Flow (Attention) -> Modality Causal Effect (Counterfactual) -> Multi-View Ensemble
**Critical path:** Input multimodal samples → Individual bias quantification methods → Ensemble integration → Bias classification
**Design tradeoffs:** Coarse vs. fine-grained analysis vs. computational cost; global vs. local attribution vs. interpretability
**Failure signatures:** Low agreement between methods suggests ambiguous bias; detector-dependent results indicate methodological instability
**First experiments:** 1) Run each method independently on sample dataset; 2) Test ensemble performance vs. individual methods; 3) Evaluate detector sensitivity by changing underlying misinformation detectors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human evaluation based on only 300 samples across two datasets may not generalize
- Performance metrics need replication with larger sample sizes to establish robustness
- Methodology's dependence on specific saliency attribution methods and counterfactual generation techniques introduces uncertainty about generalizability

## Confidence
- **Multi-view analysis performance (79.33%/83.33% accuracy):** High confidence
- **Vulnerability to detector-induced fluctuations:** Medium confidence
- **Higher agreement on modality-balanced samples:** Medium confidence
- **Practical utility for benchmark cleaning:** Low confidence (requires real-world validation)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the human evaluation with at least 1000 samples across multiple diverse multimodal misinformation datasets to assess generalizability
2. Systematically test how different misinformation detector architectures (CNN, Transformer, MLLM-based) affect the bias quantification results
3. Conduct cross-dataset validation by training bias analysis methods on one benchmark and testing on unseen multimodal misinformation datasets to evaluate robustness
