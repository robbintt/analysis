# Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Model Deployment: Evaluating Multi-Armed Bandits in ML Ops Environments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2503.22595
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22595
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** RL-based deployment strategies match or exceed traditional methods in ML Ops environments

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates whether reinforcement learning-based approaches, specifically multi-armed bandit algorithms, can improve model deployment decisions in ML Ops environments compared to traditional methods. The authors test six deployment strategies—including naive deployment, validation-based selection, A/B testing, and three RL approaches (Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling)—across two real-world datasets: a Census dataset for income classification and a highly imbalanced Bank Account Fraud dataset. Results show that RL-based methods, particularly Epsilon-Greedy and UCB, match or exceed traditional approaches in both datasets, with Epsilon-Greedy achieving the highest overall performance on the Fraud dataset (PR-AUC of 0.0690) and A/B testing performing best on the Census dataset (balanced accuracy of 0.6571). The study demonstrates that RL methods provide adaptive model selection that reduces reliance on manual intervention and mitigates risks associated with model drift and overfitting, especially in environments where validation performance does not reliably predict production performance. The findings suggest RL-based deployment strategies offer a more robust solution for dynamic ML Ops environments.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluated six model deployment strategies across two real-world datasets. The strategies included naive deployment (always using the best validation model), validation-based selection (using validation performance to choose models), A/B testing (splitting traffic between models), and three reinforcement learning approaches: Epsilon-Greedy (balancing exploration and exploitation with epsilon parameter), UCB (Upper Confidence Bound, using confidence intervals to balance exploration), and Thompson Sampling (probabilistic approach using beta distributions). The evaluation used a Census dataset for income classification and a highly imbalanced Bank Account Fraud dataset with 5% positive class. Each strategy was tested through simulation, with production performance measured against validation performance to assess the gap between expected and actual results.

## Key Results
- RL-based methods, particularly Epsilon-Greedy and UCB, match or exceed traditional approaches in both datasets
- Epsilon-Greedy achieved the highest overall performance on the Fraud dataset (PR-AUC of 0.0690)
- A/B testing performed best on the Census dataset (balanced accuracy of 0.6571)
- RL methods provide adaptive model selection that reduces reliance on manual intervention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RL-based deployment strategies work by continuously learning from production data rather than relying solely on validation performance. The multi-armed bandit algorithms dynamically adjust which model receives traffic based on real-time performance feedback, allowing them to adapt to concept drift and production-environment differences that validation sets cannot capture. This creates a feedback loop where the deployment system becomes increasingly accurate at selecting the optimal model for current conditions, reducing the risk of deploying models that perform well in validation but poorly in production. The exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in bandit algorithms ensures both discovery of potentially better models and exploitation of known good performers.

## Foundational Learning
The study builds on foundational multi-armed bandit literature, specifically algorithms like Epsilon-Greedy, UCB (Upper Confidence Bound), and Thompson Sampling. These RL approaches draw from reinforcement learning principles where an agent learns optimal policies through interaction with an environment. The work assumes that production environments exhibit non-stationary behavior requiring continuous adaptation, a core tenet of reinforcement learning. The authors leverage the bandit framework's ability to balance exploration (trying different models) with exploitation (using known good models) in uncertain environments, which is particularly valuable when validation data may not accurately represent production conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding
The RL-based deployment system integrates into existing ML Ops pipelines as a traffic routing layer between model registries and production endpoints. The architecture assumes access to validation performance metrics for initial model evaluation, then transitions to real-time performance monitoring in production. The bandit algorithms require storage of cumulative reward statistics for each model and implementation of the specific exploration strategy (epsilon decay for Epsilon-Greedy, confidence bounds calculation for UCB, or beta distribution sampling for Thompson Sampling). The system must support dynamic traffic allocation based on algorithm decisions and provide mechanisms for logging production performance to enable continuous learning. This architecture enables automated model selection without manual intervention, assuming reliable production metrics collection and model serving infrastructure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on only two datasets, limiting external validity across diverse ML applications
- Census dataset results show A/B testing outperforming RL methods in balanced accuracy, suggesting RL approaches may not universally dominate traditional methods
- Highly imbalanced Fraud dataset (5% positive class) raises concerns about potential overfitting to specific class distributions
- Absence of long-term stability analysis and no examination of computational overhead in production environments

## Confidence
**Medium confidence**: RL methods matching or exceeding traditional approaches across both datasets
**Medium confidence**: Epsilon-Greedy achieving highest PR-AUC on Fraud dataset
**Medium confidence**: RL methods reducing manual intervention needs

## Next Checks
1. Test the deployment strategies across 10+ diverse datasets spanning different ML tasks, class distributions, and data volumes
2. Conduct long-term deployment simulations (6+ months) to assess stability under real-world model drift conditions
3. Measure computational overhead and latency impact of RL-based deployment compared to traditional methods in production-like environments
