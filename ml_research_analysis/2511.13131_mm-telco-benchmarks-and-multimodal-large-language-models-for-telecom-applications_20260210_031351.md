# MM-Telco: Benchmarks and Multimodal Large Language Models for Telecom Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.13131
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13131
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces MM-Telco, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark suite and associated models tailored for telecom applications

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MM-Telco, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark suite and associated models tailored for telecom applications. It addresses the gap in domain-specific evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) in telecommunications by providing structured datasets covering 3GPP Release 17 documents, including text-based and image-based tasks such as QA, retrieval, and PCAP analysis. The authors develop a fine-tuned Llama model (Llama-VL-Telco) for telecom image generation and editing, and conduct baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. Results show that fine-tuned models achieve significant performance improvements, particularly in telecom-specific tasks, with Llama 3.1 8B outperforming general-purpose models. The benchmark also reveals weaknesses in current multimodal LLMs, especially in image-based reasoning, guiding future research. Overall, MM-Telco provides a robust framework for evaluating and advancing LLM capabilities in telecom, with practical implications for network management, customer support, and documentation.

## Method Summary
The authors developed MM-Telco by curating 3GPP Release 17 technical documentation into structured datasets covering both text and image modalities. They created three benchmark suites: 3GPPQA (500+ text-based QA pairs across seven categories), 3GPPRetrieval (3000+ text retrieval queries), and 3GPTPCAP (200+ PCAP file analysis questions). For multimodal evaluation, they constructed a telecom image analysis benchmark with 100+ images and associated questions. The team fine-tuned Llama models on telecom-specific data and developed Llama-VL-Telco for image generation and editing tasks. Baseline experiments compared various LLMs and Vision-Language Models across the benchmarks, measuring accuracy, F1 scores, and other task-specific metrics to establish performance baselines and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Results
- Llama 3.1 8B fine-tuned on telecom data outperformed general-purpose models on 3GPPQA benchmark, achieving higher accuracy in telecom-specific knowledge retrieval
- Multimodal models showed significant performance gaps in telecom image analysis tasks, revealing weaknesses in current VLMs for domain-specific visual reasoning
- The 3GPTPCAP benchmark demonstrated that specialized models achieved better performance in network packet analysis compared to general LLMs, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by creating domain-specific pretraining and fine-tuning data that captures the unique terminology, protocols, and visual patterns found in telecommunications. By grounding models in actual 3GPP Release 17 documentation and telecom-specific image datasets, the models learn to recognize and reason about telecom concepts more effectively than general-purpose models trained on web-scale data. The multimodal aspect allows models to process both textual specifications and network diagrams, flowcharts, and packet capture visualizations that are integral to telecom operations.

## Foundational Learning
- **3GPP Standards Framework**: Understanding of 3GPP Release 17 specifications provides the domain knowledge foundation needed for telecom LLM training and evaluation
- **Telecom Protocol Stack**: Knowledge of network layers and protocols (from physical to application) enables proper context for packet analysis and network troubleshooting tasks
- **Vision-Language Integration**: Combining image processing with language understanding allows models to interpret network diagrams, signal processing charts, and equipment schematics
- **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to telecom terminology and concepts through targeted training improves performance on specialized tasks
- **Multimodal Benchmarking**: Evaluating both text and image understanding capabilities provides comprehensive assessment of model capabilities for real-world telecom applications

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw 3GPP Docs → Data Preprocessing → Benchmark Suite Construction → Model Fine-tuning → Evaluation Framework

**Critical Path:** Data curation and preprocessing → Benchmark development → Model fine-tuning → Performance evaluation and analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:** The authors chose to focus on 3GPP Release 17 for standardization and comprehensiveness, though this limits temporal coverage. They prioritized accuracy over model size, using 8B parameter models rather than larger alternatives to balance performance with computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures:** Models may struggle with out-of-distribution telecom scenarios not covered in the 3GPP Release 17 corpus, may exhibit hallucinations when encountering ambiguous technical specifications, and may fail to generalize across different telecom equipment vendors' proprietary implementations.

**First Experiments:**
1. Run baseline evaluations using GPT-4 and Claude on the 3GPPQA benchmark to establish upper bounds for general-purpose model performance
2. Conduct ablation studies testing different fine-tuning dataset sizes to determine optimal training requirements for telecom-specific adaptation
3. Evaluate model performance on cross-release generalization by testing on 3GPP Release 16 documentation after training on Release 17

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation dataset composition (80 QA pairs across 4 categories) appears relatively small for robust generalization claims, particularly given the complexity of telecom protocols
- Experimental results showing Llama 3.1 8B outperforming general-purpose models need verification across additional test scenarios and model sizes to establish reliability
- Evaluation methodology focuses primarily on accuracy metrics without addressing potential hallucination risks in telecom-critical contexts where incorrect information could impact network operations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The need for domain-specific telecom benchmarks and the general architecture of MM-Telco benchmark suite
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance improvements reported for fine-tuned models and the specific accuracy percentages
- **Low Confidence**: Generalization of results across different telecom domains and the practical impact on real-world network management scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Expand validation dataset size and diversity by incorporating additional 3GPP releases and real-world telecom documentation to verify benchmark robustness
2. Conduct ablation studies testing model performance across different fine-tuning dataset sizes to determine optimal training requirements
3. Implement safety and reliability testing specifically focused on hallucination detection in telecom-critical scenarios where incorrect outputs could impact network operations
