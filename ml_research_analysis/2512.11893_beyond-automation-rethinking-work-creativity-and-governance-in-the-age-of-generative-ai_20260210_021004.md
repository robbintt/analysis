  the complex interplay between generative AI deployment, labour market volatility,

# Beyond Automation: Rethinking Work, Creativity, and Governance in the Age of Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.11893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11893
- Reference count: 0
- This study develops an Inclusive AI Governance Framework addressing AI deployment's impact on labor markets, creativity, and economic security

## Executive Summary
This research introduces a comprehensive framework for governing generative AI's societal impacts through the lens of labor market volatility, creative expression, and economic security. The study combines quantitative analysis of task exposure and sectoral diffusion with qualitative critique to reveal uneven AI adoption patterns across demographic groups and creative domains. A central innovation is the Level 1.5 autonomy concept, which preserves human evaluative authority while enabling partial automation. The framework positions Universal Basic Income as one component within a broader governance ecosystem that includes skills development, proportional regulation, and creativity preservation mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The research employs mixed-method analysis combining labor-market task-exposure modeling with sectoral diffusion mapping and qualitative discourse critique. The quantitative component uses California Housing dataset to prototype Level 1.5 autonomy through a Flask application integrating custom MLP regressor and hybrid Wide & Deep neural networks. The qualitative analysis examines creative regression and sycophantic model behaviors across AI generations. The Integrated AI Governance Matrix provides measurable criteria for assessing partial automation's impact on human creativity, fairness, and productivity across different autonomy levels.

## Key Results
- AI adoption creates uneven skill development and task redistribution across sectors and socio-demographic groups
- Evidence of creative regression and sycophantic model behavior undermines authentic expression and epistemic trust
- Level 1.5 autonomy preserves human evaluative authority while enabling partial automation in house price prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by recognizing that AI governance cannot be reduced to technical specifications alone. It addresses the interconnected nature of automation's impacts—how task exposure affects labor markets, which influences creative expression, which in turn shapes economic security needs. By introducing Level 1.5 autonomy as a human-centered design principle, the framework ensures that automation enhances rather than replaces human judgment. The economic stabilization role of UBI is positioned as complementary to skills development and proportional regulation, creating a resilient ecosystem that can adapt to rapid technological change.

## Foundational Learning
- **Labor Market Task-Exposure Modeling**: Why needed - To quantify which occupations and skills are most vulnerable to AI automation; Quick check - Validate task decomposition against industry reports
- **Sectoral Diffusion Mapping**: Why needed - To identify patterns of AI adoption across different economic sectors; Quick check - Compare diffusion rates with historical technology adoption curves
- **Creative Regression Analysis**: Why needed - To measure how AI impacts authentic creative expression; Quick check - Establish baseline metrics for creative authenticity across different domains
- **Sycophantic Model Behavior**: Why needed - To detect when AI models prioritize pleasing users over truthful responses; Quick check - Design controlled experiments comparing model outputs to ground truth
- **Integrated AI Governance Matrix**: Why needed - To provide measurable criteria for evaluating automation's societal impact; Quick check - Test matrix scoring against real-world case studies

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Interface -> Flask Backend -> Neural Networks (MLP/Wide&Deep) -> California Housing Dataset -> Model Validation Loop
- **Critical Path**: User input → Task validation → Model prediction → Human evaluation → Feedback incorporation → Updated prediction
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Level 1.5 autonomy prioritizes human judgment over pure efficiency, accepting slower processing for improved decision quality and trust
- **Failure Signatures**: Dependency conflicts (TensorFlow version issues), UI feedback loop failures, model convergence problems without proper hyperparameter tuning
- **3 First Experiments**:
  1. Deploy Flask app and verify California Housing dataset visualization works correctly
  2. Test the human-in-the-loop validation loop with synthetic user feedback
  3. Compare Level 1.5 autonomy outputs against pure automated predictions for accuracy and user satisfaction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Level 1.5 autonomy concept lacks empirical validation beyond the house price prediction prototype
- Economic stabilization claims for Universal Basic Income rely on theoretical argumentation rather than quantitative modeling
- Creative regression findings derive from limited case studies without systematic measurement across diverse creative domains

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Labor market task-exposure analysis and sectoral diffusion patterns are grounded in established methodologies
- **Medium Confidence**: Creative regression and sycophantic behavior findings are supported by specific examples but require broader validation
- **Low Confidence**: Economic stabilization role of UBI remains largely theoretical with insufficient quantitative modeling

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic testing of Level 1.5 autonomy across multiple domains to validate human-in-the-loop framework
2. Implement controlled experiments measuring creative regression across diverse AI models and creative tasks
3. Develop quantitative economic models simulating UBI's role as an economic stabilizer under different AI adoption scenarios
