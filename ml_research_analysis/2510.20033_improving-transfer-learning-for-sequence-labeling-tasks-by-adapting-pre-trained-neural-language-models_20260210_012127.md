# Improving Transfer Learning for Sequence Labeling Tasks by Adapting Pre-trained Neural Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.20033
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20033
- Authors: David Dukić
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Proposes improved transfer learning methods for sequence labeling by adapting pre-trained neural language models through multi-task learning with external signals, bidirectional decoder modifications, and response-oriented fine-tuning strategies.

## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the challenge of adapting pre-trained neural language models to sequence labeling tasks across different domains. The work proposes three distinct mechanisms to improve transfer learning: a multi-task model incorporating domain-independent signals to mitigate negative transfer, a method to enable bidirectional information flow in autoregressive decoders by removing causal masks in specific layers, and a sequence labeling framework for LLMs using supervised in-context fine-tuning with response-oriented adaptation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that these targeted adaptations consistently outperform strong baselines, particularly in low-resource domain adaptation scenarios.

## Method Summary
The thesis presents three complementary approaches to improve transfer learning for sequence labeling tasks. First, it introduces a multi-task learning framework that couples domain-specific annotations with external domain-independent signals (OIE relations) to reduce distribution shift during domain adaptation. Second, it develops a method to transform autoregressive decoders into effective encoders by selectively removing causal masks in higher decoder layers, enabling bidirectional context utilization. Third, it proposes a sequence labeling framework for autoregressive models using supervised in-context fine-tuning with custom loss masking strategies that focus optimization on response tokens rather than entire prompts. All methods are implemented using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA/QLoRA) to enable experiments with large language models.

## Key Results
- The multi-task model with OIE signal mediation significantly improves domain adaptation performance in low-resource settings compared to standard fine-tuning.
- Selective removal of causal masks in specific decoder layer groups (e.g., configuration "0110") transforms autoregressive models into effective sequence labelers by enabling bidirectional context utilization.
- Response-oriented adaptation strategies in supervised in-context fine-tuning (particularly Multi-response Completion) stabilize training and improve performance when leveraging multiple demonstrations.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Incorporating domain-agnostic external signals into a multi-task model can mitigate negative transfer in low-resource domain adaptation for sequence labeling.
- **Mechanism:** The model aligns domain-specific event trigger annotations with domain-independent Open Information Extraction (OIE) relations, using these universal predicate-argument structures as mediators to reduce distribution shift between source and target domains.
- **Core assumption:** Predicate-argument structures are stable across domains and correlate strongly with target sequence labeling tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions multi-task model with OIE system for negative domain transfer mitigation; Chapter 4 argues coupling triggers with OIE relations achieves better transfer performance.
- **Break condition:** If OIE system fails to extract relations in target domain due to stylistic noise or if target task relies on semantics disconnected from predicate-argument structures.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Removing the causal mask from specific groups of decoder layers allows autoregressive LLMs to function as effective encoders for sequence labeling.
- **Mechanism:** Selectively removing the triangular causal mask in higher decoder blocks allows the model to utilize right-side context during fine-tuning, converting the decoder into a bidirectional encoder for specific layers.
- **Core assumption:** The model can adapt its attention patterns during fine-tuning to incorporate bidirectional information retroactively.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states method enables bidirectional information flow across decoder layers; Chapter 5 notes removing causal mask allows leveraging right-side context with experiments showing higher gains from unmasking layers closer to output.
- **Break condition:** If model scale is too small (<68M parameters) or task inherently requires strict unidirectional generation, removing mask may degrade performance or destabilize training.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Modifying the causal language modeling loss to focus exclusively on response tokens improves LLM adaptation to sequence labeling via supervised in-context fine-tuning.
- **Mechanism:** The framework proposes strategies like "Multi-response Completion" where loss is masked to apply only to output spans (responses) of demonstrations and final query, steering model to prioritize correct labeled output format.
- **Core assumption:** The model can implicitly learn to interpret instruction and in-context examples without explicit supervision on those tokens.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes utilizing autoregressive LLMs through supervised in-context fine-tuning with response-oriented adaptation strategies; Chapter 6 defines MRC loss as masking all tokens except query response and demonstration responses.
- **Break condition:** If context length becomes excessive, model may fail to attend to relevant response tokens effectively, or if instruction is critical for task definition and ignored during loss calculation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Transfer Learning Paradigms (Inductive vs. Transductive)**
  - **Why needed here:** The thesis explicitly structures contributions around these paradigms—Chapter 4 uses transductive transfer (domain adaptation with OIE) while Chapter 6 uses inductive transfer (multi-task learning via SIFT). Distinguishing these explains why different adaptation techniques are applied.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the proposed method require labeled data in the target domain (Inductive) or only in the source domain (Transductive)?

- **Concept: The Pre-train–Fine-tune Discrepancy (Causal vs. Bidirectional)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is central theoretical motivation for Chapter 5. Understanding that encoders (BERT) are bidirectional while decoders (GPT/Llama) are unidirectional explains why standard decoders struggle with sequence labeling and why "mask removal" is proposed.
  - **Quick check question:** Why does a standard autoregressive decoder struggle to classify a token if the label depends on words appearing after that token?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA)**
  - **Why needed here:** The thesis relies heavily on LoRA and QLoRA to make experiments with 7B+ parameter models computationally feasible. Proposed mechanisms are implemented on top of these efficient tuning methods.
  - **Quick check question:** In the context of this thesis, does fine-tuning update the entire pre-trained model weights or a smaller set of injected matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Raw Text → Tokenizer → Embedding Layer → Decoder Blocks (Self-Attention, Feed-Forward, Norm) → Linear Layer (Token Classification) OR LM Head (Generative) → Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Critical path:** 1) Data Preparation: Implement specific prompt formatting for SIFT or OIE label injection for Multi-task. 2) Architecture Intervention: Inject logic to toggle Causal Mask per layer. 3) Optimization Loop: Implement custom DataCollator to mask loss on non-response tokens.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Encoder vs. Decoder: Encoders (RoBERTa) are strong baselines; decoders (Llama) require architectural changes or complex optimization but offer generative flexibility. Unmasking Granularity: Full unmasking often performs worse than selective layer-group unmasking. Context Length: SIFT improves with more shots but LLMs struggle with long contexts.
- **Failure signatures:** Negative Transfer: Performance drops when moving from source to target domain if auxiliary signal is noisy. Catastrophic Forgetting/Instability: If causal mask is removed inappropriately in lower layers or small models, model fails to converge. Instruction Ignorance: If trained without instruction, model may fail to generalize if demonstrations are insufficient.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Comparison: Fine-tune standard RoBERTa-base encoder on target task. 2) Layer-wise Ablation (Decoder): Test "0000" vs "1111" vs "0110" on Llama-2 7B to verify bidirectionality hypothesis. 3) Loss Strategy Ablation (SIFT): Compare "Vanilla CLM" vs "Single-response Completion" vs "Multi-response Completion" on generative setup.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The OIE-mediated approach depends heavily on the quality and coverage of the external signal, which may degrade in target domains with significant stylistic differences.
- The causal mask removal method requires careful hyperparameter tuning to determine optimal layer configurations, with no systematic approach provided beyond grid search.
- The response-oriented adaptation assumes models can implicitly learn task instructions from demonstrations, which may fail if demonstrations are insufficient or instruction contains critical semantic information.

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The general framework of using targeted transfer learning paradigms for sequence labeling tasks is well-established with reproducible experimental results showing improvements over strong baselines.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific mechanisms (OIE mediation, causal mask removal, response-oriented adaptation) are supported by experimental evidence but have narrow operational boundaries and require careful tuning.

**Low Confidence**: The scalability to extremely large models (>70B parameters) and effectiveness in zero-shot or few-shot settings beyond tested configurations remains uncertain, with computational cost-benefit tradeoffs not fully explored.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate OIE-mediated multi-task model across domains with varying stylistic noise and predicate-argument structure availability; test failure modes when OIE system extracts irrelevant or noisy relations.

2. **Systematic Layer Selection**: Develop principled method for determining optimal causal mask removal configurations beyond grid search; investigate whether this can be predicted from model architecture or task characteristics.

3. **Instruction Dependency Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies on SIFT framework to quantify how much instruction content can be omitted while maintaining performance; determine minimum demonstrations required for model to infer task semantics without explicit instruction supervision.
