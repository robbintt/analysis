# Externally Validated Multi-Task Learning via Consistency Regularization Using Differentiable BI-RADS Features for Breast Ultrasound Tumor Segmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.15968
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15968
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on UDIAT dataset (DC=0.81) while providing malignancy classification, using consistency regularization with differentiable BI-RADS features

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of destructive task interference in multi-task learning for breast ultrasound tumor segmentation, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and exhibit poor generalization across clinical centers. The proposed method introduces consistency regularization using differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features to mitigate this interference. The approach computes four morphological features (area, boundary roughness, compactness, and texture) from soft segmentation masks and enforces agreement between predicted malignancy scores and morphology-derived malignancy priors through an MSE loss. The model is trained on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluated on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain).

## Method Summary
The proposed method tackles destructive task interference in multi-task learning by incorporating consistency regularization using differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. The approach computes four morphological features (area, boundary roughness, compactness, and texture) from soft segmentation masks and enforces agreement between predicted malignancy scores and morphology-derived malignancy priors through an MSE loss. The model is trained on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluated on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Results show statistically significant improvements in generalization for segmentation across all external datasets.

## Key Results
- Segmentation performance: UDIAT DC=0.81 vs 0.59 baseline, BUSI DC=0.66 vs 0.56, BUS-UCLM DC=0.69 vs 0.49 (all p<0.001)
- State-of-the-art segmentation performance on UDIAT (DC=0.81), matching specialized single-task methods
- Malignancy classification AUC=0.74-0.79 across external datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages consistency regularization between morphological features derived from segmentation outputs and malignancy predictions. By enforcing agreement between predicted malignancy scores and morphology-derived malignancy priors through an MSE loss, the model learns to produce segmentations that are more consistent with BI-RADS-inspired morphological characteristics of malignant tumors. This reduces destructive task interference by providing a shared representation space where both tasks can benefit from the complementary information encoded in morphological features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-task learning interference**: Why needed - To understand why joint training of segmentation and classification tasks can lead to suboptimal performance; Quick check - Verify that baseline MTL models show degraded performance compared to single-task models
- **BI-RADS morphological features**: Why needed - To provide clinically interpretable features for regularization that capture tumor characteristics relevant to malignancy; Quick check - Confirm that the four features (area, boundary roughness, compactness, texture) are differentiable and computable from soft masks
- **Consistency regularization**: Why needed - To enforce agreement between related outputs and reduce task interference; Quick check - Ensure the MSE loss between malignancy predictions and morphological priors is properly weighted and contributes to convergence

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Encoder -> Segmentation Head + Classification Head <- Morphological Feature Extractor (from segmentation)

**Critical Path**: Input image flows through shared encoder to produce features, which branch to segmentation and classification heads. The segmentation output is processed to extract morphological features, which are then used to compute a malignancy prior that is compared with the classification head output via MSE loss.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (additional morphological feature extraction and consistency loss computation) for improved generalization and reduced task interference. The choice of four specific BI-RADS features represents a balance between capturing clinically relevant morphology and maintaining differentiability.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor segmentation quality would lead to unreliable morphological features, breaking the consistency regularization mechanism. Large domain shifts between training and target datasets may overwhelm the regularization benefits. Overly aggressive regularization (high λ) could force the model toward feature-space solutions that don't generalize well to actual malignancy patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing each morphological feature to quantify individual contributions; 2) Varying the consistency regularization weight λ to find optimal tradeoff; 3) Testing on a held-out subset of the training domain to establish upper performance bounds before external validation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study demonstrates clear improvements in segmentation performance but shows more modest gains in malignancy classification (AUC improvements of 0.02-0.03 across datasets)
- The morphological features used for regularization are hand-crafted and may not capture all relevant tumor characteristics that influence malignancy assessment
- The consistency regularization mechanism may not fully address the underlying domain shift issues between clinical centers

## Confidence
**High confidence in**: External validation methodology and statistical significance of segmentation improvements; the general framework of using differentiable BI-RADS features for consistency regularization; state-of-the-art performance on UDIAT dataset.

**Medium confidence in**: The magnitude of generalization improvements across all three external datasets; the clinical relevance of segmentation improvements without corresponding gains in classification; the optimal weighting of the consistency regularization term (λ=0.5).

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each morphological feature to the consistency regularization performance, and test whether learned features could outperform hand-crafted BI-RADS-inspired features.

2. Perform extensive domain adaptation experiments by systematically varying the proportion of target domain data in training to establish the method's performance across different domain shift scenarios and determine the minimum required target data.

3. Evaluate model robustness to acquisition parameter variations by testing on datasets with known differences in ultrasound machine manufacturers, imaging protocols, or patient populations to better understand the limits of generalization.
