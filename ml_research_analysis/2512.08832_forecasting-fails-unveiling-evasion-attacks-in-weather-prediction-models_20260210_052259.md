# Forecasting Fails: Unveiling Evasion Attacks in Weather Prediction Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.08832
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08832
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Introduces WAAPO framework for generating stealthy adversarial perturbations in weather forecasting models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a framework for generating stealthy adversarial perturbations in weather forecasting models like FourCastNet. The method enforces constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness to ensure perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Experiments using ERA5 data demonstrate that WAAPO can manipulate forecasts to align with adversarial targets, even with small perturbations. Results show that while FourCastNet is robust to random Gaussian noise, targeted attacks can cause significant forecast deviations.

## Method Summary
WAAPO employs a constrained optimization framework that generates adversarial perturbations while maintaining physical realism. The method enforces three key constraints: channel sparsity (limiting the number of affected atmospheric variables), spatial localization (concentrating perturbations in specific geographic regions), and smoothness (ensuring perturbations vary gradually across space). The optimization process uses iterative refinement to find perturbations that minimize forecast error while satisfying these constraints. The framework is tested on ERA5 reanalysis data using FourCastNet, a state-of-the-art weather forecasting model.

## Key Results
- WAAPO achieves PMRG values of 0.105 (patch-based) and 0.565 (channel-based), smaller than random noise yet still impactful
- Targeted attacks cause significant forecast deviations while random Gaussian noise is less effective
- Perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible despite being adversarial
- FourCastNet shows vulnerability to targeted attacks despite robustness to random noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
WAAPO works by exploiting the sensitivity of deep learning weather models to carefully crafted perturbations. By constraining the perturbations to be sparse, localized, and smooth, the method ensures they remain physically plausible while still being effective at manipulating model outputs. The optimization framework iteratively refines perturbations to maximize their impact on forecast accuracy while minimizing their detectability.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Data -> WAAPO Framework -> Constrained Optimization -> Adversarial Perturbations -> FourCastNet -> Forecast Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the iterative optimization loop where perturbations are generated, applied to input data, evaluated through FourCastNet, and refined based on forecast deviations from target outcomes.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational complexity for stealth and physical realism. More constraints mean more realistic perturbations but require more optimization iterations. The balance between attack effectiveness and imperceptibility is carefully managed through the constraint parameters.

**Failure Signatures:**
- If perturbations are too large, they become detectable through physical inconsistency checks
- If constraints are too strict, the optimization may fail to find effective perturbations
- If the target forecast is physically impossible, the method may produce unrealistic results

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test WAAPO on simple synthetic weather data to verify basic functionality
2. Apply WAAPO to historical weather events to assess real-world applicability
3. Compare WAAPO's effectiveness against baseline attack methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experiments limited to single model (FourCastNet) and dataset (ERA5), limiting generalizability
- Physical realism claims not extensively validated against meteorological constraints
- Computational cost and scalability of optimization framework not discussed
- Practical feasibility of implementing such attacks in real-world systems not addressed

## Confidence
- High confidence: Technical implementation of WAAPO and demonstration of effectiveness on tested model
- Medium confidence: Claims about physical realism and imperceptibility of perturbations
- Low confidence: Generalizability of results to other models and real-world scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Test WAAPO on multiple weather forecasting models and diverse datasets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct expert meteorological review of the perturbed forecasts to validate physical realism claims
3. Perform computational complexity analysis and runtime profiling of the WAAPO framework
