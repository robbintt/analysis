- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07010

- **Primary result:** Vision-guided judge-corrector pipeline improves low-resource multimodal machine translation for four Indian languages with +1.30 BLEU for English-Bengali evaluation set

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving low-resource multimodal machine translation (MMT) for four Indian languages by enhancing the quality of training data. The authors propose a vision-guided judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal large language models to automatically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The pipeline classifies translations as correct, requiring visual disambiguation, or having poor translation quality, and routes them to specialized correctors (GPT-4o-mini for visual disambiguation, IndicTrans2 for linguistic errors). This approach processes 28,928 training examples and corrects an average of 17.1% of captions per language. Experimental results show that LoRA fine-tuning on corrected data yields consistent improvements over training on original data, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali (evaluation set), +0.70 for English-Bengali (challenge set), +0.60 for English-Odia (evaluation set), and +0.10 for English-Hindi (challenge set).

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage pipeline: a judge module using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite to classify translations into three categories (correct, visually ambiguous, poor translation) with confidence scores, followed by routing to specialized correctors (GPT-4o-mini for visual disambiguation or IndicTrans2 for linguistic errors). A confidence threshold of 0.7 filters uncertain judgments. The corrected data is then used for LoRA fine-tuning of a single IndicTrans2 model across all four languages simultaneously, with LoRA parameters (r=16, α=32, 0.8M trainable parameters) to enable parameter-efficient adaptation.

## Key Results
- Vision-guided judge-corrector pipeline achieves +1.30 BLEU improvement for English-Bengali evaluation set
- Process corrects an average of 17.1% of captions per language (range: 12.1% to 24.0%)
- Multilingual LoRA fine-tuning shows consistent gains across all language pairs
- Malayalam shows highest correction rate (24.0%) but was omitted from submission due to resource constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Tri-Category Error Classification with Visual Grounding
- Claim: Multimodal LLMs can systematically categorize translation errors into actionable types when provided simultaneous access to image, source text, and target translation.
- Mechanism: The judge module processes cropped image regions alongside English captions and target translations, classifying each into: correct, visual_context_needed, or poor_translation. This routing enables specialized correction—GPT-4o-mini handles visual ambiguities (26.7% of corrections), while IndicTrans2 retranslates pure linguistic errors (73.3%).
- Core assumption: The multimodal LLM's error classification aligns sufficiently with human judgment to guide correction routing.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated"; [Section 3.3.1] "The judge is explicitly instructed to focus on major issues while ignoring minor stylistic variations... captions flagged as incorrect but with confidence below 0.7 are retained without modification"; [corpus] Related work (CaMMT) explores images as cultural context in MMT, but corpus lacks direct validation of LLM-as-judge classification accuracy for Indic languages.
- Break condition: If the judge's classifications have low precision (many false positives), corrections could degrade already-accurate translations. The Odia challenge set decline (-0.10 BLEU) suggests this may occur when base error rates are already low.

### Mechanism 2: Confidence-Threshold Gating
- Claim: A confidence threshold prevents uncertain automated corrections from degrading training data quality.
- Mechanism: The judge outputs a 0-1 confidence score; captions classified as "incorrect" but with confidence < 0.7 are preserved unchanged. This conservative gating reduces false positive corrections.
- Core assumption: Low-confidence judgments correlate with ambiguous cases where human judgment would also be uncertain, and preserving original text is safer than automated intervention.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.3.1] "To mitigate the impact of uncertain judgments, we implement a confidence threshold: captions flagged as incorrect but with confidence below 0.7 are retained without modification"; [Figure 3] Shows distribution of low-confidence cases by language, with Malayalam having the most retained examples; [corpus] No direct corpus validation of confidence thresholding in MMT data cleaning.
- Break condition: If the confidence scores are poorly calibrated (high-confidence errors or low-confidence correct predictions), the threshold may either allow harmful corrections or block beneficial ones.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-Lingual Transfer via Multilingual LoRA Fine-Tuning
- Claim: Training a single model on all four Indic languages simultaneously enables cross-lingual transfer while maintaining language-specific accuracy.
- Mechanism: A single IndicTrans2 model (200M distilled) is fine-tuned with LoRA (r=16, α=32, 0.8M trainable parameters) on all language pairs together, using FLORES-200 language codes to distinguish targets. Each batch contains mixed-language examples.
- Core assumption: Related Indic languages share transferable representations that benefit lower-resource pairs through joint training.
- Evidence anchors: [Section 3.4.3] "Each training batch contains examples from all languages, enabling the model to share representations across related Indic languages"; [Section 3.4.3] References Arivazhagan et al. (2019) for cross-lingual transfer benefits; [corpus] No direct corpus validation specific to Indic language cross-transfer in this architecture.
- Break condition: If languages have conflicting translation patterns, multilingual training could cause interference. The paper does not report language-specific training for comparison.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of IndicTrans2, updating only 0.4% of parameters (0.8M of 200M). Understanding rank (r=16), scaling factor (α=32), and target modules (q_proj, v_proj) is essential to reproduce or modify the approach.
  - Quick check question: If you wanted to double the trainable parameter count while keeping the same architecture, which LoRA hyperparameter would you modify and why?

- Concept: **LLM-as-a-Judge Paradigm**
  - Why needed here: The entire data cleaning pipeline depends on using multimodal LLMs to evaluate translation quality. Understanding prompt engineering for structured outputs (status, reason, confidence, explanation) and DSPy for type-safe LLM interaction is critical.
  - Quick check question: What are two failure modes of LLM-as-judge systems that could corrupt training data at scale?

- Concept: **BLEU and RIBES Metrics**
  - Why needed here: The paper reports BLEU (+1.30 for Bengali) and RIBES (+0.0021 for Hindi evaluation) improvements. BLEU captures n-gram overlap; RIBES evaluates word ordering. Understanding these metrics helps interpret whether improvements reflect semantic accuracy or surface fluency.
  - Quick check question: If a model produces a semantically correct translation with different word order than the reference, which metric would you expect to penalize it more heavily?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Training Data (28,928 examples × 4 languages) → Preprocessing: Crop images to bounding boxes, unify format → Judge Module (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite + DSPy) → Output: {status, reason, confidence, explanation} → Confidence Filter (threshold = 0.7) → Router → [Correct: preserve] → [visual_context_needed: GPT-4o-mini VLM] → [poor_translation: IndicTrans2 retranslate] → Corrected Training Data (17.1% modified on average) → LoRA Fine-Tuning (IndicTrans2 200M, r=16, α=32) → Merged Model → Inference (text-only, greedy decoding)

- Critical path: Judge accuracy → Correction quality → Training data integrity → Model performance. Errors compound: a misclassified caption routed to wrong corrector may introduce new errors.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **LoRA vs. Full Fine-Tuning**: LoRA enables rapid experimentation but likely underestimates gains (full fine-tuning teams achieved higher scores)
  - **Conservative threshold (0.7)**: Reduces false positives but may miss true errors in ambiguous cases
  - **Multilingual vs. Language-Specific**: Single model simplifies deployment but may cause language interference
  - **Automated vs. Manual Correction**: Scales to 29K examples but cannot replicate native speaker judgment perfectly (Odia decline on challenge set)

- Failure signatures:
  - **Odia challenge set decline (-0.10 BLEU)**: Suggests over-correction when base error rate is already low (12.1%)
  - **Malayalam highest correction rate (24.0%)**: May indicate either genuinely noisy data or judge over-sensitivity to specific language patterns
  - **Hindi minimal gains (+0.10)**: May reflect ceiling effects for already-clean, higher-resource language

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Ablate confidence threshold**: Compare 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 thresholds on a held-out validation set to measure precision-recall tradeoff for error detection
  2. **Compare monolingual vs. multilingual LoRA**: Train separate models per language to isolate cross-lingual transfer effects
  3. **Human evaluation sample**: Manually annotate 200 judge classifications across all four languages to measure classification accuracy and calibrate confidence scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Does the vision-guided correction approach yield significant performance gains for Malayalam, given its high training data error rate?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note Malayalam had the highest correction rate (24.0%) but was omitted from submission, inviting future work to "validate this hypothesis" (Section 4.3).
  - Why unresolved: Resource and time constraints prevented the submission of results for the English-Malayalam language pair.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating the model on the corrected Malayalam dataset to compare performance against the baseline.

- **Does full fine-tuning on corrected data compound performance improvements compared to the LoRA-based approach?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.2.3 and 4.3 state that LoRA likely underestimates potential gains and that combining corrected data with full fine-tuning could yield further improvements.
  - Why unresolved: The study exclusively used parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to facilitate rapid experimentation and comparison.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A comparative experiment performing full fine-tuning of IndicTrans2 on the corrected dataset.

- **Do native speaker human evaluations validate the quality improvements suggested by automatic metrics?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 identifies "human evaluation by native speakers to validate improvements beyond automatic metrics" as a key direction for future work.
  - Why unresolved: The study relied solely on automatic metrics (BLEU, RIBES), which may not fully capture translation adequacy or fluency.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A human evaluation study where native speakers blindly assess translations from both original and corrected models.

- **Does cleaning the evaluation and challenge test sets reveal higher true performance gains than those measured against original noisy references?**
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 4.3 argues that "test set quality issues likely suppress reported scores" and suggests applying the pipeline to create higher-quality evaluation benchmarks.
  - Why unresolved: The current evaluation penalizes model outputs that deviate from potentially erroneous ground truth references.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Re-scoring the model outputs against a manually verified or pipeline-corrected test set.

## Limitations

- The absence of human evaluation to validate the multimodal LLM's classification accuracy is the primary limitation. The judge's confidence threshold (0.7) is heuristic without empirical calibration against ground truth error annotations.
- The Odia challenge set decline (-0.10 BLEU) suggests automated correction may introduce errors when base data quality is already high, but the exact false positive rate remains unknown.
- The multilingual LoRA approach, while parameter-efficient, lacks comparison to language-specific fine-tuning to isolate cross-lingual transfer benefits versus potential interference.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The mechanism of using visual context for disambiguation (GPT-4o-mini corrections on 26.7% of errors) is well-supported by the quantitative results showing consistent gains across languages. The confidence thresholding approach is also straightforward to implement and evaluate.
- **Medium confidence:** The multimodal LLM classification accuracy and routing decisions are plausible but unverified without human judgment comparison. The cross-lingual transfer benefits are theoretically sound but lack direct empirical validation against monolingual baselines.
- **Low confidence:** The exact magnitude of improvements may be overestimated due to the lack of ablation studies (confidence threshold sensitivity, language-specific vs. multilingual training).

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation on 200 randomly sampled judge classifications across all four languages to measure classification accuracy, calibrate confidence scores, and identify systematic error patterns in the routing decisions.

2. Perform ablation study varying confidence threshold (0.5, 0.7, 0.9) on a held-out validation set to quantify the precision-recall tradeoff and optimize the gating mechanism for each language's error profile.

3. Compare multilingual LoRA fine-tuning against separate language-specific models trained on original data to isolate cross-lingual transfer effects and identify any language interference patterns.
