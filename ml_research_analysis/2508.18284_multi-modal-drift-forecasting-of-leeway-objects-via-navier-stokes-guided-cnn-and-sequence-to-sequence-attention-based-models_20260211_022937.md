# Multi-Modal Drift Forecasting of Leeway Objects via Navier-Stokes-Guided CNN and Sequence-to-Sequence Attention-Based Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.18284
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18284
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Multi-modal ML framework (CNN + Sentence Transformer + Transformer) outperforms traditional physics models and ML baselines for leeway object drift forecasting.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict the drift of leeway objects in water. The framework combines experimental data collection (wind/current velocities, object mass/area) with Navier-Stokes-based CFD simulations to estimate drag/lift coefficients via a trained CNN. Multi-modal inputs (environmental time series + textual object descriptions) are fed into MM-Attention-STS-LSTM and MM-STS-Transformer models. Results show the transformer model consistently outperforms traditional physics-based models and ML baselines (RNN, TCN, STS-LSTM) across multiple time horizons (1s, 3s, 5s, 10s), with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE scores significantly lower than curve-fit and RNN approaches. The method demonstrates strong generalization and improved long-term forecasting for search and rescue applications.

## Method Summary
The method uses a Navier-Stokes simulation to generate drag/lift coefficients for 179 synthetic object geometries, which are then used to train a lightweight CNN to predict coefficients from 2D images. Forces are calculated using these coefficients and combined with environmental time-series data and Sentence Transformer embeddings of object descriptions to form a 399-dimensional multi-modal input. Two seq2seq models—MM-Attention-STS-LSTM and MM-STS-Transformer—are trained on this input to predict multi-step drift trajectories (dx, dy). The transformer model uses a 4-head attention mechanism with dm=64 and ff=128, trained with Adam (lr=1e-3), MSE loss, early stopping, and ±5% noise augmentation.

## Key Results
- The MM-STS-Transformer consistently outperforms traditional physics models and ML baselines (RNN, TCN, STS-LSTM) across 1s, 3s, 5s, and 10s prediction horizons.
- MAE and RMSE scores for the transformer are significantly lower than those of curve-fit and RNN approaches, especially at longer horizons.
- The transformer exhibits a slower degradation rate in prediction accuracy over time, indicating better long-term generalization.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Estimating physical force coefficients via a simulation-trained CNN provides robust physical inductive biases, conditionally improving drift prediction over raw data alone.
- **Mechanism:** A CNN is trained on synthetic 2D geometric data labeled with drag/lift coefficients derived from Navier-Stokes CFD simulations. Once trained, it infers coefficients for real leeway objects, which are used to calculate drag and lift forces as input features for the forecasting model.
- **Core assumption:** The 2D geometric approximations and specific Reynolds numbers used in simulation transfer effectively to the 3D physical objects in the lake environment.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...estimate drag and lift coefficients of the leeway objects... via a trained CNN."
  - [section II-B] "...training a CNN to learn the mapping from object geometry to these coefficients."
- **Break condition:** If the real-world hydrodynamic conditions differ significantly from the laminar/simplified simulation assumptions, the coefficient estimates may introduce systematic error.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Injecting semantic object descriptions via Sentence Transformers allows the model to disambiguate objects that share similar environmental contexts but have different drift characteristics.
- **Mechanism:** Textual descriptions (e.g., "Inflatable orange raft...") are encoded into 384-dimensional vectors using a pre-trained Sentence Transformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). These vectors are concatenated with numerical time-series features (velocities, forces) to form a multi-modal input tensor.
- **Core assumption:** The semantic relationships captured by general-purpose text embeddings correlate meaningfully with physical drift behaviors (e.g., "lightweight PVC" implies specific inertia/drag profiles).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...integrates Sentence Transformer embeddings... combined with textual descriptions..."
  - [section III-A] "...network can learn cross-modal correlations, improving its ability to generalize..."
- **Break condition:** If object descriptions are too similar for physically distinct objects (or vice versa), the text modality adds noise rather than signal, potentially overfitting the model to textual artifacts.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The Sequence-to-Sequence Transformer architecture handles long-term temporal dependencies and multi-horizon forecasting better than recurrent baselines.
- **Mechanism:** The model uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of previous time steps dynamically, avoiding the "vanishing gradient" issues common in RNNs. It predicts a sequence of future steps rather than a single step, explicitly optimizing for trajectory continuity.
- **Core assumption:** The historical window length contains sufficient context for the attention mechanism to map causal relationships over the prediction horizon.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "...transformer model consistently outperforms traditional... across multiple time horizons..."
  - [section IV-B] "...MM-STS-Transformer exhibits a slower degradation rate... indicating better long-term generalization."
- **Break condition:** If the sampling rate is too low or the dynamics too chaotic, the self-attention mechanism may attend to irrelevant historical noise, degrading performance compared to simpler local models.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Navier-Stokes Equations & CFD**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses CFD simulations based on these equations to generate the "ground truth" labels (drag/lift) for training the CNN. Understanding this helps assess the validity of the synthetic data.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a 2D simulation might fail to capture the drift behavior of a 3D object in turbulent water?

- **Concept: Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Modeling**
  - **Why needed here:** The core forecasting architecture maps an input sequence of past states to an output sequence of future states. Distinguishing this from single-step prediction is vital.
  - **Quick check question:** In a Seq2Seq model, what is the role of the "encoder" versus the "decoder" during inference?

- **Concept: Sentence Transformers (SBERT)**
  - **Why needed here:** This provides the mechanism for fusing text with sensor data. One must understand that it creates a fixed-size vector representation of semantic meaning.
  - **Quick check question:** How does concatenating a text embedding vector with a time-series feature vector affect the input dimensionality of the subsequent neural network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Experimental sensors (wind/current) -> Object Images + Text Descriptions -> Navier-Stokes simulation -> Train CNN -> Predict Coefficients -> Calculate Forces -> Sentence Transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) -> Text Embeddings -> Multi-modal Input (Forces + Sensors + Text) -> MM-STS-Transformer (Encoder-Decoder)

- **Critical path:** The Physics Estimation Module is the bottleneck. You cannot process the experimental data without first training the CNN on synthetic geometry to get the force coefficients ($C_D, C_L$) required to calculate input features.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Lightweight CNN vs. Attention-CNN:** The paper found the lightweight CNN superior for coefficient estimation, likely due to the small dataset (179 images). Adding attention increased overfitting risk.
  - **Transformer vs. LSTM:** The Transformer offers better long-horizon accuracy but requires more data/compute. The LSTM offers a strong baseline with potentially faster training.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **High MAE in CNN validation:** Suggests the synthetic CFD data does not generalize to the real object geometries.
  - **Divergent Trajectories:** If the Transformer predicts trajectories that drift physically impossible distances, check if "physics features" (forces) are being overshadowed by noise or text embeddings.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Validation:** Train the forecasting model using *only* experimental velocities (no forces, no text) to establish a performance floor.
  2. **Ablation on Physics:** Train with calculated forces but *without* text embeddings to isolate the contribution of the Navier-Stokes-guided features.
  3. **Horizon Stress Test:** Evaluate the Transformer vs. LSTM specifically at $t=10s$ and beyond to verify the claimed "slower degradation rate" of the attention mechanism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does decoupling the estimation of air and water drag/lift coefficients affect the accuracy of drift predictions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state they "assumed that the air and lift coefficients for both air and water are equal," acknowledging this is "likely untrue in the real world."
- **Why unresolved:** The current methodology relies on a simplified CFD simulation that does not account for the distinct Reynolds numbers and fluid dynamics differences between air and water.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A comparative study where separate CNNs are trained on distinct air and water simulation datasets, measuring the reduction in RMSE against the current unified coefficient approach.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the proposed multi-modal framework maintain performance when generalized to open-sea environments?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors note the experiments were limited to a "confined lake" and "generalization to... environments is not yet validated."
- **Why unresolved:** The "confined lake" setting exhibits lower drift rates and more constant aerodynamic/hydrodynamic parameters compared to dynamic ocean conditions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Validation results from field deployments in open water (e.g., SAR operations) showing consistent MAE/RMSE scores despite higher wind velocities and wave-induced motion.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Does integrating physics-informed constraints into the transformer architecture improve robustness?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Future work suggests "exploring physics-informed transformer architectures to embed constraints to capture robust real-world settings."
- **Why unresolved:** The current "black-box" data-driven approach may learn spurious correlations that fail under extreme or out-of-distribution environmental inputs.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Ablation studies comparing the current MM-STS-Transformer against a physics-informed variant (e.g., with Navier-Stokes loss terms) on unseen chaotic trajectory data.

## Limitations
- The reliance on simulated 2D CFD data for training the CNN introduces uncertainty about real-world transferability to 3D objects.
- Generalization is demonstrated across objects but not to radically different leeway object types (e.g., large debris vs. small life rafts).
- The fixed sequence length (ℓ_e=10) may not capture sufficient context for objects with highly variable or chaotic drift patterns.

## Confidence
- **High:** The experimental methodology (sensor setup, force calculations, data preprocessing) is well-specified and reproducible.
- **Medium:** The superiority of the transformer model over RNN/TCN baselines is demonstrated, but the ablation studies are limited; the relative contributions of physics features vs. text embeddings are not fully disentangled.
- **Low:** The mechanism by which text embeddings improve physical prediction is weakly supported; corpus neighbors do not validate the specific maritime multi-modal fusion claim.

## Next Checks
1. **Coefficient Transferability Test:** Measure the CNN's prediction error on real object geometries not present in the CFD training set; compare to error on the simulated shapes.
2. **Text Embedding Ablation:** Train and test forecasting models with forces-only vs. forces-plus-text inputs to quantify the marginal gain from semantic features.
3. **Object Generalization Test:** Apply the best-performing model to a new class of leeway object (e.g., different material, size) and measure degradation in prediction accuracy.
