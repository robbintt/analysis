## Executive Summary
This study developed AI models to detect inappropriate language in medical school curricula, focusing on six categories of linguistic bias. The research compared small language models (SLMs) with large language models (LLMs) using both fine-tuning and few-shot prompting approaches on a dataset of 500+ documents spanning 12,000+ pages. The findings demonstrate that SLMs can be more effective than LLMs for this specific task, particularly when trained on labeled data. The study also showed that incorporating negative examples from non-flagged excerpts significantly improved model performance, with up to 25% gains in AUC for specific classifiers.

## Method Summary
The researchers fine-tuned small language models on labeled data containing examples of inappropriate language across six bias categories. They compared these models against large language models using few-shot prompting techniques on the same dataset. The dataset comprised 500+ medical curriculum documents totaling 12,000+ pages. Multiple classification approaches were tested, including multilabel classifiers and specific category detectors. The study evaluated model performance using standard metrics and systematically assessed the impact of adding negative examples from non-flagged curriculum excerpts to improve detection accuracy.

## Key Results
- SLMs outperformed LLMs in detecting inappropriate language in medical curricula
- Multilabel classifier showed the best performance on annotated data
- Adding negative examples from non-flagged excerpts improved specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SLMs achieved superior performance due to their specialized training on the specific bias detection task, while LLMs struggled with task-specific optimization despite broader knowledge. The addition of negative examples helped models better distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate language patterns by providing clearer decision boundaries. The multilabel approach allowed models to capture complex relationships between different types of linguistic bias that may co-occur in medical curricula.

## Foundational Learning
- **Linguistic bias categories**: Understanding the six types of inappropriate language targeted (why needed: to properly frame the detection task and evaluation metrics; quick check: review the paper's definition of each category)
- **Small vs large language models**: Differences in architecture, training approaches, and performance characteristics (why needed: to understand why SLMs performed better; quick check: compare model specifications and parameter counts)
- **Fine-tuning vs few-shot prompting**: Different approaches to adapting pre-trained models for specific tasks (why needed: to understand the experimental design and results; quick check: review the training procedures for both approaches)
- **AUC metric interpretation**: Understanding area under the ROC curve and its significance for classification tasks (why needed: to evaluate model performance claims; quick check: examine the AUC values and their statistical significance)
- **Negative example augmentation**: The impact of adding non-flagged data to training sets (why needed: to understand the 25% performance improvement; quick check: review the composition of training datasets with and without negative examples)

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: SLM fine-tuning -> LLM few-shot prompting -> Multilabel classifier -> Specific category classifiers
- **Critical path**: Data labeling → Model training (SLM fine-tuning, LLM prompting) → Performance evaluation → Negative example integration → Final performance assessment
- **Design tradeoffs**: SLMs offer better performance with less computational overhead but may have narrower knowledge scope; LLMs provide broader understanding but require more resources and show weaker task-specific performance
- **Failure signatures**: Poor detection of subtle bias, high false positive rates, inability to generalize across different medical curricula styles, performance degradation with limited training data
- **First experiments**: 1) Test SLMs vs LLMs on held-out curriculum data from different institutions; 2) Evaluate multilabel vs specific classifier performance on new bias categories; 3) Assess the impact of varying negative example ratios on model accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How well do these models generalize to medical curricula from different institutions and geographic regions?
- What is the optimal balance between SLMs and LLMs for different types of bias detection tasks?
- How can the annotation process be standardized to reduce subjective bias in identifying inappropriate language?
- What are the long-term effects of using AI-powered detection tools on curriculum development and medical education?

## Limitations
- Dataset size (500+ documents, 12,000+ pages) may not represent full diversity of medical curricula across institutions and regions
- Performance comparison between SLMs and LLMs conducted under specific conditions (few-shot prompting) that may not generalize
- Annotation process for inappropriate language likely introduced subjective bias in identifying linguistic bias categories
- Study focused on six specific categories of linguistic bias, potentially missing other forms of inappropriate language
- Limited evaluation of model performance on real-world curriculum updates and dynamic content

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: SLMs outperformed LLMs in the specific experimental conditions tested
- **Medium confidence**: The multilabel classifier's superior performance on annotated data
- **Medium confidence**: The improvement in AUC from adding negative examples

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance across diverse medical curricula from multiple institutions and geographic regions
2. Replicate the SLM vs LLM comparison using different prompting strategies and larger prompt sets
3. Conduct inter-annotator agreement studies to quantify and reduce subjective bias in inappropriate language labeling
4. Evaluate model performance on curriculum updates and dynamically changing content
5. Assess the impact of AI-powered detection tools on curriculum development and medical education practices
