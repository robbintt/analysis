# On the Correlation between Individual Fairness and Predictive Accuracy in Probabilistic Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13165
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13165
- Reference count: 16
- The paper shows that instances more robust to perturbations in private features are more likely to be classified accurately, suggesting a positive correlation between individual fairness and predictive accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the relationship between individual fairness and predictive accuracy in probabilistic classifiers, with a focus on Bayesian networks. The authors propose that instances exhibiting greater robustness to perturbations in private features are more likely to be classified accurately. To test this hypothesis, they introduce a fairness robustness level (FRL) metric and analyze fourteen fairness-related datasets. The FRL is defined as the maximum dissimilarity between posterior distributions over the target variable when private features are perturbed. Experimental results confirm the hypothesis, showing a clear decline in prediction accuracy as FRL increases, suggesting that individual fairness and accuracy can be positively correlated.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze fourteen fairness-related datasets using Bayesian networks as probabilistic classifiers. They compute a fairness robustness level (FRL) for each test instance, defined as the maximum dissimilarity between posterior distributions over the target variable when private features are perturbed. To address computational complexity, the problem is reformulated as a most probable explanation task in an auxiliary Markov random field. This allows for more efficient computation of the FRL metric. The correlation between FRL and prediction accuracy is then examined across the datasets to test the hypothesis of a positive relationship between individual fairness and accuracy.

## Key Results
- Instances with higher fairness robustness levels (FRL) show lower prediction accuracy.
- The positive correlation between individual fairness and predictive accuracy is confirmed across multiple datasets.
- The computational reformulation as a most probable explanation task in a Markov random field provides an efficient way to compute FRL.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind the observed correlation lies in the nature of probabilistic classifiers like Bayesian networks. When an instance is robust to perturbations in private features, it means that the classification decision is less sensitive to these features. This robustness indicates that the model is relying more on other informative features for prediction, leading to more accurate classifications. Conversely, instances that are highly sensitive to private feature perturbations are more likely to be misclassified, as the model's decision is heavily influenced by these features, which may not be the most relevant for the task at hand.

## Foundational Learning
1. Bayesian Networks: Why needed - Probabilistic graphical models that represent conditional dependencies between variables. Quick check - Understand how they model joint probability distributions and perform inference.
2. Individual Fairness: Why needed - A fairness notion that requires similar individuals to be treated similarly. Quick check - Grasp the concept of Lipschitz continuity in the context of fairness.
3. Markov Random Fields: Why needed - Undirected graphical models used for representing joint probability distributions. Quick check - Understand how they differ from Bayesian networks and their applications in probabilistic inference.
4. Most Probable Explanation (MPE): Why needed - An inference task that finds the most likely assignment to all variables given some evidence. Quick check - Comprehend its role in finding the MAP assignment in graphical models.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Dataset -> Bayesian Network Model -> FRL Computation -> Accuracy Correlation Analysis
Critical path: Perturb private features → Compute posterior distributions → Calculate FRL → Measure accuracy → Analyze correlation
Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. fairness, computational complexity vs. exact computation
Failure signatures: Inaccurate FRL computation, poor model performance, lack of correlation between FRL and accuracy
First experiments: 1) Test FRL computation on a small, synthetic dataset. 2) Verify the correlation between FRL and accuracy on a single, well-understood dataset. 3) Compare the computational efficiency of the MPE reformulation against exact computation on a small dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The findings rely heavily on the assumption that the FRL metric adequately captures the relationship between individual fairness and predictive accuracy.
- The study focuses primarily on Bayesian networks, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other probabilistic models or classifiers.
- The computational reformulation as a most probable explanation task in a Markov random field may introduce approximation errors that could affect the validity of the results.

## Confidence
- The positive correlation between individual fairness and predictive accuracy (High)
- The effectiveness of the FRL metric in quantifying fairness robustness (Medium)
- The computational reformulation approach (Medium)

## Next Checks
1. Test the FRL metric and its correlation with accuracy on a wider variety of probabilistic models beyond Bayesian networks, such as Gaussian processes or variational autoencoders.
2. Conduct a theoretical analysis to formally establish the relationship between FRL and individual fairness, potentially through axiomatic definitions or formal proofs.
3. Validate the computational reformulation approach by comparing its results with exact computations on smaller datasets to assess approximation errors.
