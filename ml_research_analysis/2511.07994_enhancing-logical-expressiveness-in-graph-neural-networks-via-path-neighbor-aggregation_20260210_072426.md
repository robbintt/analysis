# Enhancing Logical Expressiveness in Graph Neural Networks via Path-Neighbor Aggregation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.07994
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994
- **Reference count:** 38
- **Primary result:** PN-GNN enhances logical expressiveness of GNNs by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths, achieving superior performance on KG reasoning tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of existing C-GNN methods in learning logical rules by proposing PN-GNN, which enhances logical expressiveness through path-neighbor aggregation. The authors theoretically demonstrate that PN-GNN has strictly stronger logical expressiveness than C-GNN, particularly in learning U-structure logical rules that C-GNN cannot capture. Experiments show PN-GNN achieves 100% accuracy on most synthetic datasets and competitive performance on real-world datasets like FB15K237 and WN18RR, while effectively alleviating the negative impact of constant labels on model generalization.

## Method Summary
PN-GNN introduces a novel path-neighbor aggregation mechanism that enhances the logical expressive power of graph neural networks. The method aggregates node-neighbor embeddings along reasoning paths, allowing it to capture complex logical structures that traditional C-GNN methods cannot learn. The approach combines path-based aggregation with neighbor aggregation to create a more expressive representation that can learn U-structures and other complex logical patterns. Theoretical analysis proves that PN-GNN has strictly stronger logical expressiveness than C-GNN, and experiments validate this through superior performance on both synthetic and real-world KG reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- PN-GNN achieves 100% accuracy on most synthetic datasets, demonstrating superior logical expressiveness
- On real-world datasets FB15K237 and WN18RR, PN-GNN shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods
- PN-GNN effectively alleviates the negative impact of constant labels on model generalization
- Theoretical analysis proves PN-GNN has strictly stronger logical expressiveness than C-GNN, particularly for U-structure logical rules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PN-GNN works by enhancing the aggregation mechanism in GNNs to capture path-based reasoning patterns. By aggregating node-neighbor embeddings along reasoning paths, the model can learn complex logical structures that traditional neighbor-only aggregation misses. The path-neighbor aggregation allows the model to capture dependencies and relationships that span multiple hops in the graph, enabling it to learn logical rules like U-structures that require reasoning across disconnected paths.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Message-passing neural networks that aggregate neighbor information for node representation learning. Why needed: Provides the foundation for understanding how PN-GNN extends traditional GNN architectures.
- **Logical Expressiveness in GNNs**: The ability of GNNs to learn and represent logical rules and structures. Why needed: Central concept for understanding the paper's contribution and limitations of existing methods.
- **C-GNN Methods**: Conventional GNN approaches that use neighbor aggregation for representation learning. Why needed: Establishes the baseline that PN-GNN aims to improve upon.
- **U-structure Logical Rules**: Complex logical patterns that require reasoning across disconnected paths in graphs. Why needed: Specific type of logical rule that PN-GNN can learn but C-GNN cannot.
- **Knowledge Graph (KG) Reasoning**: Task of inferring missing links or facts in knowledge graphs using logical reasoning. Why needed: Primary application domain for evaluating PN-GNN's performance.
- **Path-based Aggregation**: Technique for aggregating information along paths in graphs rather than just immediate neighbors. Why needed: Core mechanism that enables PN-GNN's enhanced logical expressiveness.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Graph -> Path-Neighbor Aggregation Module -> Message Passing Layers -> Output Layer

### Critical Path
Path extraction and aggregation → Neighbor embedding aggregation → Message passing → Output prediction

### Design Tradeoffs
The paper balances enhanced logical expressiveness against computational complexity. While path-neighbor aggregation provides superior logical capabilities, it may increase computational overhead compared to standard C-GNN methods. The design prioritizes theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance over computational efficiency.

### Failure Signatures
- Inability to learn complex logical rules on synthetic datasets
- Performance degradation on large-scale graphs due to path enumeration complexity
- Overfitting when path aggregation introduces too many parameters
- Suboptimal performance when graph structure doesn't align with path-based reasoning patterns

### First Experiments
1. Synthetic dataset evaluation with controlled logical rule structures to verify enhanced expressiveness
2. Comparative analysis with C-GNN methods on simple U-structure tasks
3. Ablation study removing path aggregation to quantify its contribution to performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for large-scale knowledge graphs with millions of nodes and edges
- Limited experimental validation of the claim to alleviate negative impacts of constant labels across diverse datasets
- Unclear practical advantages in downstream tasks beyond KG reasoning
- Competitive but not superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets

## Confidence
- **Logical expressiveness claims:** High - Well-founded theoretical analysis with clear examples
- **Experimental results:** Medium - Comprehensive evaluation but limited scalability analysis
- **Generalization claims:** Low - Limited validation across diverse scenarios and datasets

## Next Checks
1. Conduct scalability analysis of PN-GNN on large-scale knowledge graphs (millions of nodes and edges) to assess computational efficiency and memory requirements
2. Evaluate PN-GNN's performance on a broader range of downstream tasks beyond KG reasoning, such as node classification and link prediction in heterogeneous graphs
3. Perform an ablation study to quantify the contribution of each component in PN-GNN (path aggregation, neighbor aggregation) to its overall performance and logical expressiveness
