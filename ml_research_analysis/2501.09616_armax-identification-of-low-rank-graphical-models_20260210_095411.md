# ARMAX identification of low rank graphical models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.09616
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09616
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Proposes a two-stage ARMAX identification algorithm for low-rank graphical models that achieves >90% fit under low noise, outperforming traditional methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of identifying low-rank vector processes when measurement data is corrupted by noise. Traditional methods fail in this setting because noise obscures the rank-deficient spectral density, leading to non-negligible inaccuracies even under weak noise. The authors propose a two-stage algorithm that models the noisy measurement as a low-rank graphical model with a sparse plus low-rank structure. In the first stage, they estimate an AR innovation model for the low-rank latent variable using maximum entropy covariance extension. In the second stage, they estimate the deterministic relation between observed and latent variables using maximum likelihood ARMAX estimation. The authors prove the identifiability and consistency of their approach under certain conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that their method achieves high accuracy in parameter estimation and filtering, with fit values exceeding 90% for the latent variable and the deterministic relation under low noise levels. The proposed method outperforms traditional low-rank identification approaches, especially when used as a filter for denoising low-rank processes.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-stage algorithm for ARMAX identification of low-rank graphical models under measurement noise. Stage 1 computes sample covariance lags from noisy data, de-biases them using known noise variance, and solves a maximum entropy covariance extension problem to find an AR model for the latent subprocess. This generates a filtered estimate of the latent variable. Stage 2 formulates a maximum likelihood problem to estimate the deterministic relation between observed and latent variables, solving the non-convex problem using constrained Newton's method. The final output reconstructs the full denoised process using the estimated models.

## Key Results
- Achieves >90% fit for both latent variable and deterministic relation under low noise (σ=0.1)
- Outperforms traditional least-squares baseline by wide margin (fit >90% vs <50%)
- Method remains effective with 500 data points for 7-dimensional processes
- Consistent estimation proven under specific identifiability conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly modeling the measurement noise as a sparse plus low-rank structure in the inverse spectral density. Stage 1 uses maximum entropy covariance extension to separate the low-rank latent component from noise, while Stage 2 employs maximum likelihood estimation to capture the deterministic relationship between observed and latent variables. This two-stage approach correctly handles the colored noise structure that makes standard least-squares inconsistent.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Spectral Density and Rank Deficiency**
  - Why needed here: The core premise is that a "low-rank" vector process has a singular (rank-deficient) spectral density matrix. Measurement noise makes the observed spectral density full-rank, masking this key property.
  - Quick check question: If you have a 5-dimensional time series, what does it mean for its spectral density to have rank 3, and how would adding white noise change its rank?

- Concept: **Graphical Models and the Sparse Plus Low-Rank (S+L) Structure**
  - Why needed here: The paper models the conditional dependencies in the noisy process using a graph. The S+L decomposition of the inverse spectral density (precision matrix) is the key structural insight that allows separating sparse noise from low-rank latent factors.
  - Quick check question: In a latent-variable graphical model, how does the S+L structure in the inverse covariance matrix relate to sparsity in the graph's edges?

- Concept: **Maximum Likelihood Estimation for ARMAX Models**
  - Why needed here: The second stage of the algorithm solves a specific ARMAX identification problem. Unlike standard least-squares, ML is required here because the error term is a colored noise process dependent on the model parameters, making least-squares inconsistent.
  - Quick check question: In an ARMAX model A(z)y = B(z)u + C(z)e, why can't you just use simple linear regression to estimate the parameters if C(z) is not a scalar?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sample covariances -> Covariance extension (Stage 1) -> Filtered latent variable -> ARMAX ML estimation (Stage 2) -> Final denoised process
- Critical path: The accuracy of the final ARMAX model (Stage 2) is critically dependent on the quality of the filtered latent variable estimate from Stage 1. Errors in Stage 1 propagate directly.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model Order vs. Data: Higher AR/ARMAX orders allow for more complex dynamics but require significantly more data for reliable identification, increasing the risk of overfitting.
  - Convexity vs. Accuracy: Stage 1 uses a convex relaxation (maximum entropy) which is robust but may not be optimal for all signal types. Stage 2 uses a non-convex ML approach which is more accurate but harder to solve and requires good initialization.
  - Noise Level Tolerance: The method is proven consistent but practically degrades when measurement noise covariance σ² > 0.6 relative to the signal.
- Failure signatures:
  - Divergent Estimates: If the least-squares baseline is used (ignoring the colored noise), estimates for ym(t) can diverge to extreme values.
  - Rank Misspecification: If the assumed rank l is incorrect, the S+L decomposition fails, leading to poor filtering.
  - High Noise Bias: Under high noise (σ > 0.6), parameter estimates become biased, and filter fits drop sharply.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline Replication on Synthetic Data: Implement the full two-stage pipeline (LRG) and the traditional least-squares baseline (LR) using the exact parameters from the paper's Example 1. Replicate the Monte Carlo analysis to verify the reported performance gap (e.g., fit >90% vs. <50%).
  2. Sensitivity to Noise and Data Size: Systematically vary the noise standard deviation (σ from 0.1 to 1.0) and data length (N=250, 500, 1000). Plot the parameter fit fit(Ĥ) and process fit fit(ŷ) against σ to reproduce the sensitivity curves and find the operational breaking point.
  3. Identifiability Stress Test: Construct a system where the identifiability condition (Theorem 2, rank([Aq, Br]) = m) is borderline or violated. Run the identification algorithm to observe if parameter estimates become unstable or non-unique, confirming the theorem's necessity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can the rank l of the latent variable and the sparsity pattern (topology) of the deterministic relation H(z) be estimated directly from data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion states, "The rank estimation, sparsity estimation and applications of low rank graphical identification will be studied in our future work." Additionally, Section V.B notes the absence of edges was not discussed.
- Why unresolved: The current algorithm assumes the dimension of the low rank latent variable and the topology (zero entries in H(z)) are known a priori to focus on parameter estimation.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extended algorithm capable of jointly estimating the rank and topological structure alongside the model parameters without prior knowledge.

## Limitations

- Requires known noise variance and known sparsity patterns as prior information
- Performance degrades sharply when measurement noise covariance σ² > 0.6 relative to signal
- Two-stage algorithm sensitive to initialization in non-convex Stage 2 optimization
- Assumes linear and stable underlying system structure

## Confidence

- Theoretical framework and identifiability results: High
- Algorithm's practical performance on synthetic data: Medium
- Performance on real-world data with estimated topologies: Low

## Next Checks

1. Apply the method to a real low-rank process (e.g., sensor network data, financial time series) where noise and sparsity patterns can be partially verified. Compare denoised outputs against ground truth or benchmark methods.

2. Extend the method to jointly estimate the sparsity patterns (graphs) along with the ARMAX parameters, rather than assuming known topology. Evaluate the impact on identification accuracy when topology is learned from data.

3. Test the algorithm on non-stationary low-rank processes where the rank or sparsity structure changes over time. Assess robustness and propose modifications (e.g., online estimation, time-varying models) to handle such scenarios.
