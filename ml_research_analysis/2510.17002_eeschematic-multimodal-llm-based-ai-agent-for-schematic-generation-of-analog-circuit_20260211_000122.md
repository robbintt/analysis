# EEschematic: Multimodal-LLM Based AI Agent for Schematic Generation of Analog Circuit

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17002
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17002
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Achieves 90% correctness rate in converting SPICE netlists to schematics with average 10 optimization iterations

## Executive Summary
EEschematic addresses the challenge of converting analog circuit SPICE netlists into visually interpretable schematic diagrams using a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) prompting. The system integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate connectivity information into human-editable JSON format, enabling iterative refinement of component placement and wiring. Experimental results on three analog circuits demonstrate strong performance with high visual quality and structural correctness.

## Method Summary
EEschematic uses Gemini 2.0 Flash MLLM with few-shot substructure examples and VCoT optimization to convert SPICE netlists to schematic diagrams. The process involves initial placement recognition using six analog substructure examples, followed by iterative optimization (10 placement + 20 wiring iterations) using visual comparison against reference examples. A custom wiring algorithm with priority ordering reconstructs connectivity, and outputs are represented in human-editable JSON format.

## Key Results
- Achieves 90% correctness rate across test circuits
- Requires average 10 optimization iterations for convergence
- Successfully generates schematics for CMOS inverter, 5T-OTA, and telescopic cascode amplifier

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Few-shot substructure examples enable spatial generalization without comprehensive template libraries. The MLLM abstracts placement principles from six manually-constructed analog substructure examples and applies them to novel circuit topologies. Core assumption: MLLMs can infer generalizable spatial organization rules from limited exemplars. Break condition: Significant divergence from provided examples (e.g., emerging topologies).

### Mechanism 2
Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) enables iterative self-correction through multimodal feedback loops. The MLLM receives current schematic as image, compares against reference examples, generates modification reasoning, and produces updated JSON coordinates. Core assumption: MLLMs can perform meaningful visual comparison and generate actionable modification reasoning. Break condition: Degradation for complex schematics with dense connectivity.

### Mechanism 3
Multimodal representation alignment creates coherent cross-domain mapping for schematic generation. Four representations (natural language, SPICE netlist, schematic diagram, JSON) are presented together, forcing the MLLM to learn associations between textual connectivity, symbolic geometry, and visual layout. Core assumption: Joint presentation induces cross-modal reasoning without explicit training. Break condition: Errors in any modality propagate across all outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **SPICE netlist syntax and node conventions**: Why needed: Input is exclusively SPICE format; understanding device lines and node naming is required. Quick check: Given `M2 out in 0 0 nmos W=1u L=0.09u`, which node is the source and which is the bulk?

- **Analog schematic layout principles (symmetry, signal flow, matching)**: Why needed: Evaluation criteria include aesthetics measured by symmetry; understanding layout principles helps interpret optimization objectives. Quick check: Why might a telescopic cascode amplifier require more careful placement optimization than a simple CMOS inverter?

- **JSON schema for parametric geometry**: Why needed: Intermediate representation uses JSON with fields like `origin`, `rotation`, `flip`; modifying these values affects schematic changes. Quick check: What coordinate system and rotation convention does the JSON schema use?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input SPICE netlist -> Initial Placement (MLLM with substructure examples) -> Custom Wiring Algorithm -> Placement Optimization Loop (VCoT, max 10 iterations) -> Wiring Optimization Loop (VCoT, max 20 iterations) -> Output JSON -> Schematic renderer

- **Critical path**: Initial substructure recognition and placement determines whether subsequent optimization can succeed. Poor initial placement may require more iterations than allowed.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Iteration count vs. computational cost; example coverage vs. context length; rule-based wiring vs. learned wiring.

- **Failure signatures**: High iteration count without convergence suggests poor initial placement; correct connectivity with poor aesthetics suggests VCoT succeeded structurally but failed spatially; oscillating modifications indicate unstable reasoning loop.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce baseline results on three test circuits using Gemini 2.0 Flash; verify 90% correctness and observe iteration distribution.
  2. Ablate few-shot examples: reduce from 6 to 3; measure impact on 5T-OTA correctness and iteration count.
  3. Test generalization boundary: introduce circuit not covered by substructure examples; evaluate correctness degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can EEschematic effectively generalize to complex, multi-stage analog topologies and mixed-signal systems?**: The current work focused on fundamental circuits; future studies should assess scalability to larger systems.

- **What quantitative visual metrics can replace subjective human evaluation to objectively assess schematic aesthetics?**: Current methodology relies on manual assessment for symmetry and clarity, introducing variability and making consistent comparison difficult.

- **Can constraint-guided refinement strategies guarantee convergence toward fully correct schematics where VCoT fails?**: Despite increasing iterations, some generated schematics still exhibit structural or connectivity errors; constraint-guided strategies may provide solution.

## Limitations

- Context window constraints may limit scalability to complex circuits with many components
- Visual reasoning quality degrades for denser, more complex analog systems
- Six substructure examples may not cover emerging circuit topologies or non-standard configurations

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core approach of using few-shot substructure examples with iterative VCoT optimization is well-supported by experimental results on three test circuits.

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that approach scales to more complex analog and mixed-signal systems is supported by mechanism description but lacks empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: Assertion of "genuinely multimodal reasoning rather than fixed template generation" is plausible but difficult to verify without ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test**: Apply EEschematic to a complex analog circuit (e.g., 3-stage operational amplifier or 10+ transistor filter) and measure correctness rate, iteration count, and convergence behavior.

2. **Ablation Study**: Remove VCoT visual reasoning component and replace with rule-based optimization only; measure impact on correctness and aesthetics scores.

3. **Generalization Boundary**: Create test circuit containing topology not represented in six substructure examples; evaluate whether system can still produce correct schematics and determine if additional examples are required.
