# LLM-Prior: A Framework for Knowledge-Driven Prior Elicitation and Aggregation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.03766
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03766
- Authors: Yongchao Huang
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: A framework that couples LLMs with tractable generative models to automate prior elicitation and uses Logarithmic Opinion Pool for robust multi-agent aggregation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LLM-Prior, a framework that automates the elicitation of prior distributions for Bayesian inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). The core innovation is an architectural coupling where an LLM acts as a parameter generator for a tractable generative model (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models), ensuring the output is a valid probability distribution. The framework extends to multi-agent systems by using the Logarithmic Opinion Pool (LogP) for aggregating distributed priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. Experiments demonstrate the LLM can translate natural language into meaningful priors (Beta and GMM distributions) and that LogP produces coherent consensus distributions.

## Method Summary
LLM-Prior uses a "separation of concerns" architecture where an LLM (e.g., Gemini 2.5) interprets unstructured natural language contexts and outputs parameters for a predefined generative model like a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) or Beta distribution. Constraints are enforced on the LLM's raw output to ensure validity (e.g., mixture weights sum to 1). For multi-agent systems, the Logarithmic Opinion Pool aggregates individual priors via a weighted geometric mean, preserving external Bayesianity. A federated version (Fed-LLMPrior) is presented for distributed settings. The framework is validated through three tasks: eliciting Beta priors for coin flip scenarios, aggregating conflicting priors, and generating multi-modal GMMs for bimodal data.

## Key Results
- LLM successfully translates natural language contexts into valid Beta distribution parameters (a, b) matching semantic meaning (uninformative, fair, biased).
- Bayesian updating with generated priors produces coherent posteriors aligned with observed data (8 heads, 2 tails).
- Logarithmic Opinion Pool aggregates conflicting priors into a consensus distribution that is a compromise between extremes.
- LLM generates coherent 2-component GMM parameters for bimodal data (Old Faithful), demonstrating capability for complex, multi-modal priors.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can translate unstructured natural language contexts into valid prior distributions by acting as parameter generators for explicit generative models.
- Mechanism: The LLMPrior operator uses a "separation of concerns" architecture. The LLM performs semantic interpretation, outputting the parameters (e.g., mixture weights, means, covariances) for a pre-defined generative model like a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The generative model, not the LLM, guarantees the final output is a mathematically valid, normalized probability density function.
- Core assumption: The statistical regularities encoded in the LLM's pre-training corpus contain sufficient signal to produce meaningful distribution parameters when prompted with a specific context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...architectural coupling an LLM with a tractable generative model... ensures the output satisfies essential mathematical properties like non-negativity and normalization."
  - [section 3.1] "We solve this by proposing a 'separation of concerns' architecture where the LLM is responsible for semantic interpretation, generating the parameters for a separate, explicit generative model... that guarantees validity by construction."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Logarithmic Opinion Pool (LogP) provides a theoretically principled method for aggregating priors from multiple, potentially heterogeneous agents.
- Mechanism: LogP aggregates distributions via a weighted geometric mean, not a linear average. This method is "externally Bayesian," meaning it commutes with Bayesian updating—the final posterior is the same whether priors are aggregated before or after individual Bayesian updates.
- Core assumption: Individual priors are valid probabilistic beliefs, and preserving "external Bayesianity" is desirable for coherent group-level inference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Logarithmic Opinion Pool is advocated for aggregating distributed priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity."
  - [section 3.2] "Genest et al.[23] showed that LogP is the only aggregation (pooling) operator that enjoys external Bayesianity... A group using a LogP will reach the same posterior belief regardless of whether they pool their priors before observing new data or after."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The MDN-LLM architecture can elicit complex, multi-modal priors by prompting the LLM for structured GMM parameters.
- Mechanism: The LLM is prompted to return a structured JSON object containing the parameters for a K-component GMM (weights, means, standard deviations). Constraints, such as enforcing weights sum to 1, are applied to the raw output to ensure the resulting GMM is a valid distribution.
- Core assumption: An LLM can reliably output structured numerical data in response to a carefully engineered prompt without significant hallucination or constraint violation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "The LLM's role is to map the context C to the parameters... of a K-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)... To ensure validity, constraints are enforced on the LLM's raw outputs."
  - [section 4.4] "Presented with a detailed context describing the bimodal nature... The model's output was remarkably accurate... This result successfully demonstrates that the LLMPrior framework... can effectively elicit more complex, multi-modal priors."

## Foundational Learning

### Concept: Bayesian Inference & Prior Distributions
- Why needed here: The framework's core purpose is to automate prior elicitation, a known bottleneck in Bayesian analysis where prior knowledge is encoded as a probability distribution.
- Quick check question: Why is the specification of the prior distribution considered a fundamental bottleneck in traditional Bayesian analysis?

### Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
- Why needed here: GMMs are the explicit generative model used in the primary MDN-LLM architecture. Understanding their components (weights, means, covariances) is essential for interpreting the LLM's output.
- Quick check question: What are the three sets of parameters that define a K-component Gaussian Mixture Model?

### Concept: Logarithmic Opinion Pool (LogP)
- Why needed here: This is the proposed method for aggregating distributed priors. Its theoretical properties, like external Bayesianity, justify its use over a simple average.
- Quick check question: How does the Logarithmic Opinion Pool differ from a linear average of distributions, and what is its key theoretical property?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map: Agent -> LLM (e.g., Gemini 2.5) -> MDN-LLM Operator -> GMM/Beta Distribution -> LogP Aggregator (for multi-agent systems)

### Critical path: Context C is wrapped in a prompt instructing the LLM to output a JSON of parameters. The LLM's output is parsed and constrained (e.g., softmax for weights) to form a valid prior p(z|C). For federated setups, these priors are aggregated via LogP on a central server.

### Design tradeoffs: Expressiveness vs. Tractability. Complex priors like GMMs are more expressive but create an intractable K^N component mixture during aggregation, requiring approximation. Simple priors (Beta) are less expressive but aggregate analytically.

### Failure signatures:
- **LLM Hallucination:** LLM outputs non-numeric or physically impossible values (e.g., negative standard deviation). Mitigation: strict prompt engineering.
- **Prompt Sensitivity:** Minor rephrasing of context C leads to drastically different priors. This is a known vulnerability.
- **Intractable Aggregation:** Computational cost explodes when aggregating many agents with high-component GMMs.

### First 3 experiments:
1. Replicate Task 1: Prompt an LLM with contexts for an "Uninformative," "Fair," and "Biased" coin to generate Beta distribution parameters (a, b). Verify they match the semantic meaning.
2. Replicate Task 2: Elicit priors from two "agents" with opposing weak beliefs and aggregate them using LogP. Verify the consensus is a compromise distribution.
3. Replicate Task 3: Prompt an LLM with a description of bimodal data (Old Faithful) and verify it generates a coherent 2-component GMM.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the computational complexity of aggregating multi-modal priors via Logarithmic Opinion Pool be reduced to scale effectively for large multi-agent systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section notes that aggregating N GMMs results in a mixture of K^N components, creating a "combinatorial explosion" that makes exact aggregation intractable.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as the "most critical research direction" but only suggests potential avenues (variational methods, moment matching) without implementing a solution for complex priors.
- What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm capable of approximating the aggregated product of mixtures in polynomial time while maintaining the "externally Bayesian" property.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the uncertainty inherent in the LLM generation process be mathematically integrated into the prior specification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section highlights that the current experiments rely on point estimates of parameters, ignoring the LLM's generation variance.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats the LLM's output as a fixed parameter rather than a distribution, which the authors note prevents a "complete Bayesian treatment" of the model uncertainty.
- What evidence would resolve it: A hierarchical model where the LLM generates a hyper-prior over parameters (e.g., by varying temperature or prompts), resulting in posteriors that marginalize over this generation uncertainty.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What automated validation layers are required to detect and correct LLM artifacts, such as hallucinations or biases, in the generated prior parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors admit the risk of the LLM generating "nonsensical parameters" or inheriting training biases despite structured JSON prompts.
- Why unresolved: The framework currently relies on careful prompt engineering rather than architectural safeguards to ensure semantic validity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validation mechanism that successfully filters physical or logical impossibilities (e.g., negative variances) independent of the specific prompt used.

### Open Question 4
- Question: To what extent does the phrasing of the input context induce artificial variance in the elicited priors, and can this sensitivity be minimized?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Discussion section lists "Sensitivity to input prompts" as a vulnerability, noting that the framework's performance is tied to the quality of prompt engineering.
- Why unresolved: The mapping from context to parameters is demonstrated on unambiguous prompts; it is unclear how robust the operator is to ambiguous or poorly phrased contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study showing consistent prior outputs across semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse prompts, or a conversational agent that resolves ambiguity before generation.

## Limitations
- Computational scalability is a major bottleneck for aggregating high-dimensional GMMs due to the K^N component explosion during LogP aggregation.
- The framework's performance is highly sensitive to prompt engineering quality, with no demonstrated robustness to ambiguous or poorly phrased contexts.
- LLM artifacts (hallucinations, biases) in generated parameters are acknowledged but not addressed with automated validation layers.

## Confidence

### Confidence Labels for Major Claims
- **High**: Separation of concerns architecture ensures valid PDF outputs; LogP is theoretically principled for distributed aggregation.
- **Medium**: LLM can translate natural language into meaningful prior parameters for Beta and simple GMMs.
- **Low**: MDN-LLM can reliably elicit complex, high-dimensional priors and LogP aggregation scales to federated settings with many agents.

## Next Checks
1. **Prompt Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the wording of the elicitation prompts across multiple semantically equivalent contexts and quantify the variance in generated prior parameters. This will directly test the framework's robustness to LLM hallucination and prompt engineering fragility.
2. **Scalability Benchmark for GMM Aggregation**: Implement and benchmark the LogP aggregation for GMMs with increasing numbers of agents (N) and mixture components (K). Measure the computational cost and approximation error of the proposed variational/moment-matching methods against the theoretical K^N complexity.
3. **Expert Validation Study**: Deploy the framework in a real-world domain (e.g., medical diagnosis or risk assessment) with domain experts providing natural language contexts. Compare the LLM-generated priors against expert-specified priors and evaluate the impact on downstream Bayesian inference quality.
