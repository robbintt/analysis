# Boosted GFlowNets: Improving Exploration via Sequential Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09677
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09677
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Sequentially training an ensemble of GFlowNet models with residual rewards improves exploration and sample diversity while maintaining non-degradation guarantees

## Executive Summary
Boosted GFlowNets address a fundamental challenge in standard GFlowNet training: the exploration bottleneck in multimodal reward landscapes. By sequentially training an ensemble of models where each new model optimizes a residual reward that compensates for mass already captured by previous models, this approach reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions. Under mild assumptions, this residual principle ensures a monotone non-degradation property - adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. The method preserves the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training while achieving substantially better exploration and sample diversity.

## Method Summary
The Boosted GFlowNets framework introduces a sequential ensemble training approach that builds upon standard GFlowNet architecture. Each model in the ensemble learns to optimize a residual reward, which is computed as the difference between the target reward and the cumulative mass already captured by previous models. This creates a cascading effect where each subsequent model focuses on regions that previous models have failed to adequately explore. The training proceeds by first training a base GFlowNet model, then computing the residual reward based on the current ensemble's coverage, and finally training additional booster models to capture the remaining reward mass. The framework maintains compatibility with existing GFlowNet training algorithms while adding the ensemble mechanism.

## Key Results
- Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration on multimodal synthetic benchmarks compared to standard GFlowNets
- The method demonstrates improved sample diversity in peptide design tasks while maintaining quality
- The residual reward principle ensures non-degradation - adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it
- The approach preserves the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core mechanism exploits the observation that standard GFlowNets often struggle to explore multimodal reward landscapes due to premature convergence to dominant modes. By introducing a residual reward that captures what previous models have missed, each subsequent model is incentivized to explore new regions of the state space. This creates a division of labor among the ensemble members, where early models capture easy-to-find modes while later models focus on more challenging or subtle regions. The residual principle ensures that each model receives a meaningful learning signal throughout training, preventing the stagnation that occurs when reward mass is already adequately captured.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input data -> Base GFlowNet -> Residual reward computation -> Booster models -> Ensemble output

Critical path: Data generation → Base model training → Residual reward calculation → Booster model training → Ensemble prediction

Design tradeoffs:
- Sequential vs parallel ensemble training: Sequential allows adaptive residual rewards but increases training time
- Number of boosters: More boosters improve coverage but increase computational cost and potential overfitting
- Residual reward formulation: Different formulations may affect convergence speed and stability
- Model capacity: Larger models can capture more complex distributions but require more data and computation

Failure signatures:
- Degenerate ensembles where all models converge to similar regions
- Instability in residual reward computation leading to training divergence
- Insufficient exploration even with multiple boosters due to poor residual signal
- Computational bottlenecks from sequential training of multiple large models

First experiments:
1. Train a standard GFlowNet on a simple multimodal synthetic benchmark and analyze mode coverage
2. Implement the residual reward computation and verify it correctly identifies underexplored regions
3. Add a single booster model and compare mode coverage against the base model alone
