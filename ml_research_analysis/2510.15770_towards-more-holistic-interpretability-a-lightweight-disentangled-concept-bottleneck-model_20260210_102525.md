# Towards more holistic interpretability: A lightweight disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15770
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15770
- Authors: Gaoxiang Huang; Songning Lai; Yutao Yue
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: Introduces LDCBM, a lightweight disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model that automatically groups visual features into semantically meaningful components without requiring region annotations

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LDCBM, a lightweight disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model that addresses the key limitation of existing CBMs: poor alignment between visual patterns and human-understandable concepts. The method automatically groups visual features into semantically meaningful components without requiring region annotations by introducing a filter grouping loss that maximizes intra-group similarity and minimizes inter-group similarity. Joint concept supervision aligns these learned visual patterns with ground-truth concepts. Experiments on three diverse datasets (CUB, CelebA, AwA2) demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy compared to vanilla CBM and CEM, with class accuracy improvements of 5-10% across datasets.

## Method Summary
LDCBM introduces a filter grouping loss that optimizes visual feature groupings to maximize intra-group similarity and minimize inter-group similarity. The model performs spectral clustering every 2 epochs to optimize group assignments, creating filter groups that are then aligned with ground-truth concepts through joint supervision. This approach eliminates the need for region annotations while ensuring that learned visual patterns correspond to semantically meaningful concepts. The architecture maintains the CBM structure while adding this disentanglement mechanism that operates on convolutional filter activations.

## Key Results
- LDCBM achieves class accuracy improvements of 5-10% over vanilla CBM and CEM across CUB, CelebA, and AwA2 datasets
- The model demonstrates superior interpretability-performance trade-offs under intervention tests
- Higher concept accuracy compared to baseline models while maintaining competitive class accuracy
- Superior sensitivity to concept changes while achieving better initial performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by introducing a filter grouping loss that creates natural clusters of visual features based on their activation patterns. By maximizing similarity within groups and dissimilarity between groups, the model learns to associate specific visual patterns with distinct semantic concepts. The spectral clustering component dynamically optimizes these groupings during training, while joint concept supervision ensures alignment with ground-truth concepts. This automated grouping process eliminates the manual annotation burden of previous approaches while maintaining strong semantic alignment.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept Bottleneck Models**: Models that predict concepts before making final class predictions; needed to understand the baseline approach being improved
- **Filter Group Disentanglement**: Process of separating convolutional filters into distinct semantic groups; needed to understand how visual patterns are organized
- **Spectral Clustering**: Unsupervised clustering technique using graph Laplacians; needed to understand the dynamic grouping optimization
- **Joint Supervision**: Training on both concept and class labels simultaneously; needed to understand how semantic alignment is enforced
- **Intervention Tests**: Evaluating model behavior when concept values are artificially modified; needed to understand interpretability validation
- **Filter Group Similarity Loss**: Optimization objective that encourages coherent grouping; needed to understand the core training mechanism

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image -> CNN Backbone -> Filter Groups (via Spectral Clustering) -> Concept Predictor -> Class Predictor

**Critical Path:** Image features flow through CNN layers, where filter grouping loss organizes activations into semantic clusters, which then feed into concept prediction layers that jointly learn with class prediction layers

**Design Tradeoffs:** Balances interpretability (disentangled concepts) against performance (accuracy), simplifies annotation requirements by eliminating region supervision, and trades computational overhead of frequent clustering for better semantic alignment

**Failure Signatures:** Poor concept alignment indicated by low concept accuracy despite high class accuracy, sensitivity to choice of K (number of groups), potential computational bottlenecks from frequent spectral clustering

**First Experiments to Run:**
1. Baseline CBM without filter grouping loss to establish performance floor
2. LDCBM with varying numbers of filter groups (K) to find optimal configuration
3. Intervention test comparing concept sensitivity between LDCBM and baseline models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the LDCBM framework generalize to safety-critical domains like medical imaging where region annotations are scarce but interpretability is vital?
- Basis in paper: The introduction highlights "healthcare" as a critical application for interpretable AI, yet experiments are limited to standard computer vision datasets (CUB, CelebA, AwA2)
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the method on data with different texture characteristics or grayscale modalities common in medical scans
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on medical datasets (e.g., ChestX-ray) showing LDCBM maintains concept alignment and accuracy without region supervision

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the model's performance to the manual selection of the number of filter groups ($K$) relative to the number of concepts?
- Basis in paper: The experimental setup states the authors manually "choose the number of cluster 16, 32, 32" for different datasets rather than learning this parameter
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the model performance degrades significantly if $K$ deviates from the optimal manually selected value or if $K$ should scale with dataset complexity
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study analyzing concept and class accuracy across a wide range of $K$ values for a fixed dataset

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the requirement to perform spectral clustering every 2 epochs impose a computational bottleneck that limits scalability to larger datasets?
- Basis in paper: The methodology notes that spectral clustering is performed frequently (every 2 epochs) to optimize group assignments
- Why unresolved: While termed "lightweight" regarding architecture, the algorithmic overhead of repeated spectral clustering on large batches is not quantified against training time
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of total training time and memory overhead between LDCBM and baseline CBMs on a large-scale dataset like ImageNet

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy metrics with limited analysis of how well learned concepts align with human semantic understanding
- Claim of "automatically grouping visual features" lacks qualitative examples showing what these patterns look like to human observers
- No assessment of model robustness to noisy or incomplete concept labels, which are common in real-world applications

## Confidence
- High confidence: The technical methodology for filter grouping and joint concept supervision is sound and well-described
- Medium confidence: The reported accuracy improvements over baselines are reliable, but the practical significance depends on downstream application requirements
- Medium confidence: The claim of superior interpretability-performance trade-offs needs more rigorous validation through human studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies where domain experts assess whether the automatically learned visual patterns correspond to meaningful semantic concepts in each domain
2. Perform ablation studies removing the filter grouping loss to quantify its exact contribution to the performance improvements
3. Test the model's robustness to noisy or incomplete concept labels, as real-world applications often involve imperfect ground truth
