# Optimizing Energy Management of Smart Grid using Reinforcement Learning aided by Surrogate models built using Physics-informed Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.17380
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17380
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** PINN surrogate reduces RL training time by 50% and inference time by 10x while maintaining accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing energy management in smart grids using reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when dealing with costly simulators that hinder sample efficiency. The authors propose using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as surrogate models to replace expensive smart grid simulators, thereby accelerating the RL policy training process. The proposed method was tested on the ANM6-Easy environment, a Gym-ANM framework simulating a simple distribution smart grid. Results showed that PINN-based surrogate models achieved a 50% reduction in policy training time and a 10x speed-up in inference time compared to the original environment, while maintaining accuracy and reliability. The PINN surrogate outperformed other state-of-the-art surrogate models (e.g., XGBoost, decision trees) in terms of convergence speed and robustness, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the underlying physical nature of the grid. This approach has significant implications for the future of smart grid management and optimization, particularly in integrating renewable energy sources and managing dynamic consumption patterns.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to optimize energy management in smart grids. The approach involves training a PINN surrogate model to replace the expensive smart grid simulator, enabling faster RL policy training. The PINN surrogate is trained on state-action trajectories generated using Sobol sampling or random agent trajectories. The surrogate consists of three modules: a KKT-informed neural network for generator and battery setpoints, a physics-informed neural network for power balance, and an XGBoost classifier for terminal state detection. The trained surrogate is then used to train a PPO RL agent using Stable-baselines3. The method was evaluated on the ANM6-Easy environment, demonstrating significant improvements in training time and inference speed while maintaining accuracy and reliability.

## Key Results
- PINN-based surrogate models achieved a 50% reduction in policy training time and a 10x speed-up in inference time compared to the original environment.
- The PINN surrogate outperformed other state-of-the-art surrogate models (e.g., XGBoost, decision trees) in terms of convergence speed and robustness.
- The approach maintained accuracy and reliability while demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the underlying physical nature of the grid.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PINN surrogate leverages the underlying physics of the smart grid to generate more accurate and efficient predictions compared to purely data-driven approaches. By incorporating physics-informed loss terms and KKT conditions into the neural network architecture, the surrogate can better capture the complex relationships between states, actions, and rewards in the grid environment. This enables faster convergence and more stable learning for the RL agent, as it can explore the state-action space more effectively without being hindered by the computational overhead of the original simulator.

## Foundational Learning
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):** Neural networks that incorporate physical laws and constraints into their architecture and loss functions. Why needed: To capture the underlying physics of the smart grid and generate more accurate and efficient predictions compared to purely data-driven approaches. Quick check: Verify that the PINN surrogate respects the physical constraints of the grid, such as power balance and voltage limits.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. Why needed: To optimize the energy management policy in the smart grid by learning from the surrogate model. Quick check: Ensure that the RL agent is able to learn a stable and effective policy using the PINN surrogate.
- **Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions:** Necessary conditions for a solution to be optimal in nonlinear programming problems. Why needed: To incorporate the optimality conditions of the power flow equations into the PINN surrogate, ensuring that the generated setpoints are physically feasible. Quick check: Verify that the KKT-informed neural network produces feasible power setpoints that satisfy the grid constraints.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Sobol samples -> PINN surrogate (KKT-informed + Physics-informed + XGBoost classifier) -> PPO RL agent

Critical path: Sobol samples -> PINN training -> PPO training on surrogate -> Evaluation

Design tradeoffs: The use of PINNs introduces additional complexity in the surrogate model architecture and training process compared to purely data-driven approaches. However, this complexity is offset by the improved accuracy and efficiency in capturing the underlying physics of the smart grid.

Failure signatures: Surrogate extrapolation error (high MAE during realistic episodes) and RL buffer saturation (impaired or unstable training).

### First experiments
1. Train the PINN surrogate on the Sobol samples and evaluate its performance on a held-out test set.
2. Use the trained PINN surrogate to train a PPO RL agent and compare its performance to a baseline RL agent trained on the original environment.
3. Evaluate the robustness of the PINN surrogate by testing it on out-of-distribution state-action pairs and comparing its performance to other surrogate models (e.g., XGBoost, decision trees).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the PINN-based surrogate approach maintain its inference speed and accuracy advantages when scaled to significantly larger transmission grids with thousands of buses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Future work should focus on scaling this approach to larger and more complex grid systems..."
- Why unresolved: The current study uses the ANM6-Easy environment (6 buses), but computational demands for matrix operations in power flow equations increase non-linearly with grid size.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the KKT-Informed Neural Network and Power Balance Network architectures to standard IEEE test cases (e.g., IEEE 118 or 300-bus systems) with comparable training speed-ups.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the introduction of realistic stochastic variables, such as unpredictable weather conditions and dynamic energy pricing, affect the stability and convergence of the PINN-aided RL policy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "...other scenarios with realistic weather conditions and energy pricing objectives may provide substantial insights into the limits of automatic optimization..."
- Why unresolved: The current ANM6-Easy environment is deterministic with a "future-awareness hypothesis" (demand/generation profiles are known 24 hours in advance), which simplifies the Markov decision process.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study where the RL agent is trained on a PINN surrogate fed with stochastic time-series data for load and renewable generation rather than fixed profiles.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the PINN architecture be modified to inherently detect unsolvable or "terminal" states, eliminating the need for the current external binary classifier?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Section 3.1.3 notes that the surrogate model always produces an output and cannot discern unsolvable equations, necessitating a separate XGBoost classifier to identify terminal states.
- Why unresolved: Relying on a separate classifier introduces a potential point of failure and disconnects the "physics-informed" nature of the surrogate from the feasibility check.
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified PINN architecture that outputs a specific signal (e.g., loss divergence or a probability score) indicating the physical infeasibility of a state without external modules.

## Limitations
- The proposed approach is currently limited to the ANM6-Easy environment, a simplified smart grid with only 6 buses. Its scalability and effectiveness in larger, more complex grid systems remain to be demonstrated.
- The method relies on the availability of high-quality training data, which may be challenging to obtain in real-world smart grid scenarios with limited observability and controllability.
- The use of PINNs introduces additional complexity in the surrogate model architecture and training process, which may require specialized expertise and computational resources.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The reported 50% reduction in policy training time and 10x speed-up in inference time compared to the original environment are supported by the experimental results. The superiority of the PINN surrogate over other state-of-the-art surrogate models (e.g., XGBoost, decision trees) in terms of convergence speed and robustness is also well-established.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that the PINN surrogate maintains accuracy and reliability while outperforming other models is supported by the reported MAE and $R^2$ metrics. However, the exact implementation details of the "KKT-Informed Neural Network" logic and the specific input scaling/normalization ranges for the Sobol samples are not explicitly provided, which may impact reproducibility.
- **Low confidence:** The generalizability of the results to more complex smart grid environments beyond the ANM6-Easy case is uncertain. The paper does not discuss the scalability of the approach or provide evidence of its effectiveness in larger, more realistic scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce the exact implementation of the "KKT-Informed Neural Network" logic referenced in the paper to ensure faithful reproduction of the results. This may require consulting the cited arXiv paper (2409.09087) for detailed implementation guidelines.
2. Conduct experiments on more complex smart grid environments beyond the ANM6-Easy case to assess the scalability and generalizability of the proposed approach. This could involve testing the method on larger grid topologies or more realistic scenarios with increased renewable energy integration and dynamic consumption patterns.
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the physics-informed loss term and the specific neural network architecture (e.g., number of hidden layers, residual connections) to the overall performance of the surrogate model. This would help identify the key factors driving the observed improvements and guide future refinements of the approach.
