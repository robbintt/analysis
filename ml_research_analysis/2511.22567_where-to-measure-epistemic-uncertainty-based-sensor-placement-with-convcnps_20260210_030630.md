# Where to Measure: Epistemic Uncertainty-Based Sensor Placement with ConvCNPs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.22567
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22567
- **Reference count:** 33
- **Primary result:** Epistemic uncertainty-based sensor placement with ConvCNPs + MDNs outperforms total uncertainty methods, achieving lower RMSE and NLL with just 10 sensors in Baltic Sea SST monitoring.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a novel approach to sensor placement that leverages epistemic uncertainty decomposition in Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs) extended with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs). By decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic (model ignorance) and aleatoric (data noise) components, the method prioritizes sensor placement in functionally ambiguous regions where additional measurements would most reduce model uncertainty. Applied to sea surface temperature monitoring in the Western Baltic Sea, the approach demonstrates significant improvements over traditional total uncertainty-based methods, particularly when sensor budgets are limited.

## Method Summary
The method extends ConvCNPs with MDNs to enable uncertainty decomposition into epistemic and aleatoric components in a single forward pass. A greedy iterative algorithm selects sensor locations by approximating expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty using the model's own predictions as pseudo-observations. The approach is evaluated on Baltic Sea SST data, comparing epistemic uncertainty-driven placement (Δ_Ep) against total uncertainty-based placement (Δ_Var) across varying sensor budgets.

## Key Results
- Epistemic uncertainty-based placement achieves lower RMSE and NLL than total uncertainty methods on held-out test data
- With 10 sensors, Δ_Ep outperforms Δ_Var, demonstrating improved efficiency for environmental monitoring
- The approach successfully prioritizes functionally ambiguous areas over regions with high aleatoric uncertainty
- Performance dip observed at N_s=2 sensors due to potential epistemic uncertainty underestimation with K=2 components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Mixture Density Networks with K=2 components decompose ConvCNP predictive variance into epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in a single forward pass. Each mixture component represents a local hypothesis about the conditional mapping. Epistemic uncertainty is computed as weighted disagreement between component means, while aleatoric uncertainty is the weighted average of component variances. Core assumption: mixture component disagreement meaningfully captures functional ambiguity reducible by additional observations.

### Mechanism 2
Acquisition functions targeting expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty (Δ_Ep) select more informative sensor locations than total uncertainty (Δ_Var) by prioritizing reducible model ignorance over irreducible data noise. Δ_Var conflates both uncertainty types, causing placement in high-noise regions. Δ_Ep isolates regions where the model is genuinely uncertain about the underlying function—locations where new data most constrains the posterior. Core assumption: aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced by additional measurements.

### Mechanism 3
Greedy iterative selection using model-predicted pseudo-observations can approximate optimal sensor placement without ground-truth access. For each candidate location, temporarily append (x_i, ŷ_i) to context set and compute average epistemic variance across all target locations. Select location yielding maximum reduction. Repeat until N_s sensors placed. Core assumption: the model's prior predictions are sufficiently accurate that pseudo-observations approximate true measurement impact on uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning

- **Neural Processes and ConvCNPs**: Why needed: ConvCNPs form the base architecture—unlike standard neural networks, they handle variable-sized context sets and output predictive distributions. Quick check: How does a ConvCNP's SetConv layer enable processing of non-gridded sensor observations?

- **Aleatoric vs Epistemic Uncertainty**: Why needed: The paper's core contribution hinges on distinguishing reducible model uncertainty from irreducible data noise. Quick check: In a temperature sensor with ±0.5°C measurement noise, which uncertainty type does this represent and can it be reduced by adding more sensors?

- **Mixture Density Networks**: Why needed: MDNs enable single-forward-pass uncertainty decomposition via K mixture components—understanding variance decomposition is essential. Quick check: For a Gaussian mixture with K=2 components having means μ₁, μ₂ and variances σ₁², σ₂², write expressions for the total variance and its decomposition into within-component and between-component terms.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Context set C = {(x_i, y_i)} → SetConv (spatial encoding) → U-Net backbone → Interpolation module → MDN output head → Uncertainty decomposition → Acquisition scoring

- **Critical path:** Context encoding → grid projection → U-Net processing → interpolation → MDN outputs → uncertainty decomposition → acquisition scoring (Δ_Ep computation)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - K=2 vs K>2: K=2 is efficient but may underestimate epistemic uncertainty in complex regions (authors note K>2 may help)
  - Single forward pass vs ensembles: Faster than MC-Dropout/ensembles but potentially less robust uncertainty
  - Greedy vs global optimization: Tractable for large candidate sets but not provably optimal

- **Failure signatures:**
  - N_s=2 performance dip: "epistemic uncertainty may be underestimated when using K=2 components"
  - High aleatoric dominance: If σ²_Al >> σ²_Ep throughout domain, Δ_Var and Δ_Ep may converge to similar behavior
  - Single-day evaluation: Results may not generalize across seasons (winter vs summer SST patterns)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce synthetic 1D experiments (Section 8.1) with noisy data and multiple-function data to validate that σ²_Ep and σ²_Al behave as expected in controlled settings.
  2. Train ConvCNP with K=1 vs K=2 on Baltic Sea training split (1993–2018), comparing validation NLL trajectories and checking for overfitting timestamps.
  3. Run greedy placement with Δ_Var vs Δ_Ep on multiple held-out test dates across seasons to verify RMSE/NLL improvements generalize beyond the January 1, 2022 single-day evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the number of mixture components (K) affect the quality of epistemic uncertainty estimation and downstream sensor placement performance? Basis: [explicit] "the choice of K=2 mixture components may not fully capture epistemic uncertainty in all regions, and increasing the number of components could further improve performance". Why unresolved: Only K=2 was tested; the paper notes epistemic uncertainty may be underestimated with this configuration. What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying K (e.g., K=2,3,4,5) with evaluation of calibration metrics and sensor placement RMSE/NLL.

### Open Question 2
How well do MDN-based epistemic uncertainty estimates correlate with actual predictive performance improvements after sensor placement? Basis: [explicit] Future work will "assess how reductions in estimated epistemic uncertainty correlate with actual predictive performance (RMSE and NLL)". Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates improved sensor placement but does not validate whether estimated epistemic uncertainty is quantitatively accurate. What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between predicted epistemic uncertainty reduction and observed error reduction across held-out test scenarios.

### Open Question 3
How does the approach compare to established uncertainty quantification methods like MC-Dropout and ensembles? Basis: [explicit] Future work includes "comparing against Monte Carlo-Dropout [13] and ensemble baselines". Why unresolved: No baseline comparison was conducted; it remains unclear whether MDNs provide comparable or superior uncertainty estimates. What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison on identical sensor placement tasks with matched model capacity.

### Open Question 4
How does the method perform across temporal variations such as seasonal differences? Basis: [explicit] "evaluations across multiple test days are needed to assess temporal generalization (e.g., winter compared to summer performance)". Why unresolved: Experiments used only a single test date (January 1, 2022), limiting conclusions about generalization. What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation across diverse dates spanning multiple seasons with fixed sensor locations.

## Limitations

- **Temporal generalization unknown**: Results validated only on January 1, 2022; unknown whether epistemic-uncertainty advantage persists across seasons given Baltic Sea's strong seasonal SST variability.

- **Architecture sensitivity**: Critical hyperparameters (SetConv kernel bandwidth, U-Net depth, optimizer configuration) unspecified, creating significant barriers to reproducible performance.

- **Component collapse risk**: K=2 mixture components may inadequately capture hypothesis space in complex regions, particularly for small sensor counts (N_s=2), leading to underestimated epistemic uncertainty and suboptimal placements.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: ConvCNP+MDN can decompose predictive variance into epistemic and aleatoric components via mixture component disagreement and intra-component spread.

**Medium Confidence**: Epistemic uncertainty-based acquisition (Δ_Ep) outperforms total uncertainty (Δ_Var) for sensor placement, but evidence limited to single date and no comparison to alternative methods.

**Low Confidence**: Greedy pseudo-observation approximation reliably estimates expected epistemic reduction without ground-truth measurements; core assumption about prior accuracy unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Seasonal Robustness Test**: Evaluate Δ_Ep vs Δ_Var placement performance across multiple held-out test dates spanning winter, spring, summer, and fall seasons to assess temporal generalization.

2. **Component Number Sensitivity**: Train K=3 and K=4 MDN variants on validation split, comparing validation NLL and sensor placement consistency to quantify K=2 limitation impact.

3. **Prior Accuracy Assessment**: Before running placement algorithm, evaluate ConvCNP mean prediction accuracy on held-out locations (MAE, correlation) to quantify risk of poor pseudo-observation approximation.
