# Interpreting Fedspeak with Confidence: A LLM-Based Uncertainty-Aware Framework Guided by Monetary Policy Transmission Paths

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08001
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08001
- Reference count: 40
- 3-class classification of FOMC communications achieving 0.7327 Macro-F1 and 0.7426 Weighted-F1

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting Federal Reserve communications ("Fedspeak") to classify monetary policy stances, which is critical for financial forecasting and policy analysis. The authors propose a large language model-based framework that enhances policy stance classification by incorporating domain-specific reasoning grounded in monetary policy transmission mechanisms and introducing a dynamic uncertainty decoding module. The method augments Fedspeak texts with structured financial entity relations and transmission path reasoning, then uses perceptual uncertainty (PU) to guide decoding strategy selection. Experiments on the FOMC dataset show state-of-the-art performance with 6.6% and 6.2% improvements over the best baseline, with statistical analysis confirming PU as a reliable diagnostic signal for prediction reliability.

## Method Summary
The framework uses Qwen3-14B fine-tuned with LoRA on FOMC communications augmented with transmission path reasoning. Data augmentation extracts atomic entity relations (CAUSE, COND) and maps them onto a transmission path structure (X → Z → M) using structured templates. During inference, perceptual uncertainty (PU) is calculated as the product of Environmental Ambiguity (EA) and Cognitive Risk (CR) from decoding logits. This PU score dynamically selects between aggressive (greedy) and conservative (sampling) decoding strategies. The method addresses domain knowledge gaps in base LLMs and provides uncertainty quantification for financial NLP applications.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.7327 Macro-F1 and 0.7426 Weighted-F1 on FOMC dataset
- Represents 6.6% and 6.2% improvements over the best baseline
- Significant positive correlation between PU and model error rates (ρ = 0.15, p < 0.001)
- Transmission path information contributes most to performance gains (Macro-F1 falls from 0.7327 to 0.6538 when removed)
- High PU predictions show accuracy of only 0.2473, while low PU predictions achieve 0.7791 Macro-F1

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** If Fedspeak texts are augmented with structured reasoning grounded in monetary policy transmission paths, classification performance improves significantly by reducing domain knowledge gaps.
- **Mechanism:** The framework extracts atomic entity relations (e.g., CAUSE, COND) from raw text and maps them onto a transmission path structure (X → Z → M), where economic phenomena (X) are linked to policy advice (M) via specific transmission channels (Y). This forces the model to emulate expert reasoning rather than relying on surface-level keyword matching.
- **Core assumption:** The base LLM lacks sufficient embedded domain knowledge ("Cognitive Risk") and providing an explicit, structured reasoning chain compensates for this deficit.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism."
  - [section]: Ablation studies show removing the transmission path causes the largest performance drop (Macro-F1 falls from 0.7327 to 0.6538), contributing the most to performance gains.
  - [corpus]: Neighbors like *FedSight AI* utilize structured indicators for LLMs, but this paper uniquely formalizes the "Transmission Path" quadruple Γ=(X,Y,Z,M) for data augmentation.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism likely fails if the input text is highly implicit or lacks standard economic indicators, preventing the extraction template from identifying a valid X → M chain.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** If a composite uncertainty metric (Perceptual Uncertainty, PU) is derived from decoding logits, it serves as a reliable signal for identifying high-error predictions.
- **Mechanism:** PU is calculated as the product of Environmental Ambiguity (EA, derived from the entropy of top-k logits) and Cognitive Risk (CR, inversely related to the sum of logits/evidence). High PU implies the model is both confused by the input distribution and lacks the evidence to support a specific label.
- **Core assumption:** The magnitude of logits correlates with "evidence" or confidence, and top-k entropy captures ambiguity, effectively mapping LLM behavior to psychological concepts of risk and ambiguity.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates."
  - [section]: Table 3 shows predictions with Low PU achieve 0.7791 Macro-F1, while High PU predictions collapse to 0.2473.
  - [corpus]: While uncertainty quantification is common in AI, this specific PU decomposition (EA × CR) is distinct in the financial NLP domain compared to standard probability thresholds.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism may be unreliable if the model's tokenizer fragments evidence across multiple token IDs, potentially skewing the Dirichlet distribution parameters α and misestimating CR.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** If the decoding strategy adapts dynamically based on the PU score, the system can mitigate the impact of low-confidence errors.
- **Mechanism:** During inference, the model calculates PU for a candidate prediction. If PU is below a threshold, it uses an "Aggressive" (Greedy) strategy. If PU is high, it switches to a "Conservative" strategy (sampling or defaulting to Neutral), effectively acting as a safety filter.
- **Core assumption:** Forcing a greedy prediction on high-uncertainty inputs is worse than a conservative fallback or a randomized exploration.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence... enhancing... reliability."
  - [section]: The experimental setup describes selecting aggressive vs. conservative strategies based on whether PU exceeds the threshold.
  - [corpus]: Related work in the corpus typically focuses on single-pass prediction; dynamic decoding based on uncertainty metrics is a distinct operational feature here.
- **Break condition:** This mechanism fails if the validation set used to tune the PU threshold is not representative of the test set, leading to overfitting.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism (Credit, Asset Price Channels)
  - **Why needed here:** To interpret the augmented data inputs. The model receives a "Path" (Z) which traces how a shock (X, e.g., strong labor market) moves through channels (Y, e.g., credit demand) to policy advice (M). Without understanding these channels, you cannot debug the reasoning templates.
  - **Quick check question:** If "economic activity strengthens," does that typically imply a hawkish or dovish stance in an overheating economy via the Interest Rate Channel?

- **Concept:** Evidential Deep Learning (Dirichlet Distribution)
  - **Why needed here:** To understand the Uncertainty Module. The paper maps logits to a Dirichlet distribution to calculate "evidence" (α₀). You need to grasp how the sum of logits represents evidence and how entropy represents ambiguity.
  - **Quick check question:** How does increasing the evidence parameter α₀ affect the variance (uncertainty) of a Dirichlet distribution?

- **Concept:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Fine-Tuning
  - **Why needed here:** The base models (Qwen, Phi) are fine-tuned using LoRA. Understanding parameter-efficient fine-tuning is necessary to replicate the training pipeline described in the Appendix.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would one choose LoRA over full fine-tuning when adapting a 14B parameter model on a specialized dataset like FOMC minutes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  1. **Data Augmentation Pipeline:** Planner (Entity Extraction) → Executor (Path Reasoning) → Augmented Text
  2. **Model Backbone:** Qwen-3-14B (Base LLM) + LoRA Adapters
  3. **Inference Controller:** Logit Processor → PU Calculator → Strategy Selector (Threshold check)

- **Critical path:**
  Raw Text → **Template-based Augmentation** (creates X, Y, Z, M) → **Fine-Tuned LLM** → **Top-K Logits** → **PU Calculation** → **Dynamic Decoding** → Final Label

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Template Rigidity vs. Flexibility:** The paper uses structured templates (Listings 1-3). While effective (Table 7), they may fail on implicit sentences (Table 13, Sentence 3).
  - **Token Clustering:** The authors group tokens (e.g., "H", "HAWK", "Hawk") to aggregate evidence. The tradeoff is complexity in the decoding layer vs. handling tokenizer fragmentation.
  - **Threshold Tuning:** Setting the PU threshold too low results in over-cautious behavior; too high fails to filter errors.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Contextual Confusion:** The model focuses on keywords (e.g., "restrictive policy") but misses that the speaker is describing a *third-party view* (Table 13, Sentence 2).
  - **Implicit Statements:** The transmission path extraction fails when economic signals are weak or comparative rather than direct, leading to "Neutral" predictions for "Dovish" content.
  - **High PU / Low Accuracy:** A high False Positive rate in PU detection, where the model is confident (low PU) but wrong, indicates the domain reasoning (Mechanism 1) has failed to provide the correct context.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Validate Augmentation:** Train a baseline Qwen-3-14B with LoRA on *raw* FOMC text vs. *augmented* text (with transmission paths) to isolate the contribution of the reasoning chain (Goal: replicate the ~7% gain).
  2. **Uncertainty Calibration:** Run inference on a validation set and plot the correlation between PU scores and error rates to verify the "diagnostic signal" before implementing dynamic decoding.
  3. **Tokenizer Analysis:** Inspect the top-20 logits for the label tokens to verify if "evidence" is fragmented (e.g., "H" vs "HAWKISH") and requires the clustering logic defined in the Appendix.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The transmission path augmentation framework may not generalize beyond FOMC communications where explicit economic indicators are present
- The dynamic uncertainty decoding relies on the assumption that logit magnitudes correlate with evidence, which may not hold across different LLM architectures
- The template-based approach may struggle with implicit or nuanced policy communications where the X→M chain is not readily extractable

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Experimental results showing 6.6-6.2% improvements over baselines with statistical validation
- **Medium confidence:** Mechanism claims about domain knowledge compensation through transmission paths, supported by ablation but dependent on template effectiveness
- **Medium confidence:** Uncertainty quantification framework is theoretically sound but practical reliability depends on proper token clustering and threshold tuning

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation:** Apply the framework to a different central bank communication corpus (e.g., ECB minutes or Bank of England statements) to test whether the transmission path augmentation and uncertainty decoding generalize beyond FOMC communications.

2. **Threshold sensitivity analysis:** Conduct a more extensive grid search on the PU threshold parameter across multiple validation splits to quantify the stability of the dynamic decoding strategy and identify optimal thresholds that minimize both false positives and false negatives.

3. **Implicit statement handling:** Create a test set of FOMC communications containing highly implicit policy stances without explicit economic indicators, then evaluate whether the current template-based augmentation fails as predicted and what modifications would be needed to handle such cases.
