# Diffusion-Based Unsupervised Audio-Visual Speech Separation in Noisy Environments with Noise Prior

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14379
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14379
- Reference count: 0
- Presents a diffusion-based method for unsupervised audio-visual speech separation in noisy environments

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a diffusion-based approach for unsupervised audio-visual speech separation in noisy environments. The method employs separate diffusion models for clean speech and structured noise, with visual cues improving speech prior estimation. By jointly modeling both speech and noise distributions through diffusion priors, the approach solves an inverse problem to sample from posterior distributions using reverse diffusion. Experiments on WHAM! and DNS noise datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing unsupervised baselines, achieving performance close to supervised approaches with over 2 dB improvement in SI-SDR compared to the previous best unsupervised method.

## Method Summary
The approach models speech and noise as independent components corrupted by Gaussian noise, with clean speech and structured noise each modeled by separate diffusion models. A pretrained audio-visual speech separation model provides strong generative priors for speech. The method solves an inverse problem to sample from posterior distributions using a reverse diffusion process. Visual features from lip movements are incorporated through FiLM layers to improve speech prior estimation. The diffusion probabilistic sampling framework approximates the likelihood term using single-step denoiser estimates, with frequency-domain reconstruction loss providing more stable gradients than time-domain alternatives.

## Key Results
- Improves SI-SDR by over 2 dB compared to the previous best unsupervised method
- Outperforms existing unsupervised baselines on both WHAM! and DNS noise datasets
- Achieves performance close to supervised approaches in speech separation tasks
- Demonstrates robustness across different noise types including urban, restaurant, and office environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual Explicit Prior Modeling (Speech + Noise)
Jointly modeling clean speech and structured noise with separate diffusion priors enables more accurate decomposition than modeling noise implicitly or with lower-capacity representations. Two independent diffusion models provide strong generative priors, with the likelihood term coupling these priors to enforce mixture consistency while each prior regularizes its respective component toward plausible signals. This assumes noise distributions in real environments have learnable structure that diffusion models can capture better than NMF-based covariance models, with speech and noise being statistically independent.

### Mechanism 2: Audio-Visual Conditioning for Disambiguation
Visual lip features provide a conditioning signal that constrains the speech prior, improving source disambiguation when audio alone is ambiguous. A pretrained BRAVEn visual encoder maps lip video frames to 1024-dim features, injected into the speech diffusion backbone via FiLM layers at multiple resolutions. Classifier-free guidance modulates the influence of visual conditioning during sampling, assuming lip motion correlates strongly with the target speaker's phonetic content.

### Mechanism 3: Posterior Sampling via Coupled ODEs with Frequency-Domain Likelihood
Solving coupled reverse-diffusion ODEs for speech and noise jointly, guided by a frequency-domain reconstruction loss, yields better separation than time-domain only or sequential estimation. The DPS framework approximates intractable posterior scores by substituting single-step denoiser estimates into the likelihood term, with the reconstruction loss operating on power-compressed STFT magnitude for more stable gradients. This assumes the single-step denoiser provides sufficiently accurate estimates for likelihood gradient computation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Score-Based Diffusion Models**: Understanding ODE formulation and Tweedie's formula for score estimation is essential as the entire method builds on reverse diffusion via score functions. Quick check: Can you explain why $s_\theta(x_\tau, \tau) \approx (D_\theta(x_\tau, \tau) - x_\tau) / \tau^2$ using Tweedie's formula?

- **Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)**: Critical for understanding how DAVSS-NM extends DPS from single-source to multi-source separation. Quick check: How does DPS approximate the intractable likelihood term $p_\tau(r|x_\tau)$, and what role does $\zeta$ play?

- **Audio-Visual Fusion via FiLM**: Essential for understanding how visual features are integrated into the speech denoiser. Quick check: What does a FiLM layer do to audio features given a visual embedding, and why match resolutions before modulation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Noisy mixture $y$ and visual features $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^K$ -> Speech denoiser $F^S_\theta$ (NCSN++M + BRAVEn + FiLM) -> Noise denoiser $G^N_\phi$ (NCSN++M) -> Posterior sampler (coupled ODEs) -> Denoised speech and noise estimates

- **Critical path**: Load noisy mixture and visual features, initialize diffusion states to zero-mean noise, for each timestep compute single-step denoiser estimates, compute frequency-domain reconstruction loss, compute prior scores and likelihood gradients, combine into posterior scores via Algorithm 1, update diffusion states via reverse ODE, repeat until minimum timestep, output final estimates

- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-mean initialization vs warm start (zero-mean simplifies inference but may require more timesteps), frequency-domain vs time-domain likelihood (frequency-domain provides perceptually-aligned gradients but adds STFT complexity), separate noise prior vs NMF (higher capacity but requires noise training data)

- **Failure signatures**: SI-SDR degradation on unseen noise types indicates noise prior overfitting, artifacts or hallucinated speech may indicate denoiser miscalibration, divergence during sampling suggests $\zeta$ scaling issues or gradient explosion

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Reproduce SI-SDR on VoxCeleb2+WHAM! matched setup with given hyperparameters ($\zeta=0.5$, 400 steps, CFG weight 0.5); 2) Ablate noise prior by replacing $G^N_\phi$ with NMF-based model from AV-UDiffSE; 3) Test unmatched regime (train WHAM!, test DNS) to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- The audio-visual conditioning contribution lacks thorough validation through ablation studies
- Frequency-domain likelihood approximation may introduce instabilities in ODE solver
- Reliance on single-step denoiser estimates represents a known approximation with inherent limitations
- Comparison primarily against older diffusion-based approaches rather than recent supervised methods

## Confidence

- Dual-prior architecture (High confidence): Well-justified theoretically with consistent improvement over single-prior baselines
- Audio-visual conditioning contribution (Medium confidence): Incorporated but lacks ablation study isolating visual contribution
- Frequency-domain likelihood approximation (Medium confidence): Improves perceptual quality but introduces potential instabilities
- 2 dB SI-SDR improvement (Medium confidence): Significant but primarily compared against older diffusion approaches

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study removing the visual conditioning to quantify its exact contribution to performance gains versus diffusion architecture improvements alone.

2. Test the method on degraded or out-of-sync visual inputs to determine robustness to poor video quality and identify failure modes.

3. Evaluate computational efficiency and inference latency compared to both unsupervised and supervised baselines, as diffusion-based methods typically require many sampling steps.
