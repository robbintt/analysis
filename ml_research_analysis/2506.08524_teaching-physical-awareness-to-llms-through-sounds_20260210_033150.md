# Teaching Physical Awareness to LLMs through Sounds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.08524
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08524
- Reference count: 40
- LLMs trained to understand physical phenomena like Doppler effect and multipath effects through sound achieve strong performance across five tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ACORN, a framework that teaches large language models physical awareness through sound by leveraging a physics-based channel simulator to generate diverse training data, an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information, and the AQA-PHY dataset containing 1 million <Audio, Question, Answer> tuples. The framework enables LLMs to understand fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. When evaluated across five tasks (LOS detection, Doppler estimation, DoA estimation, multipath analysis, and range estimation), the models achieved strong performance: 0.924 accuracy in LOS detection, 0.181 MAE in Doppler estimation, 0.907 MAE in DoA estimation, 0.903 accuracy in multipath analysis, and 1.599 relative error percentage in range estimation, demonstrating the feasibility of teaching LLMs physical awareness through sound.

## Method Summary
ACORN employs a three-stage approach to teach physical awareness to LLMs through sound. First, it uses a physics-based channel simulator to generate synthetic audio data representing various physical phenomena including the Doppler effect, multipath propagation, and spatial relationships. Second, it employs an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information from the audio signals to extract relevant features. Third, it leverages the AQA-PHY dataset containing 1 million <Audio, Question, Answer> tuples to train the LLMs. The framework is designed to help models understand how physical properties manifest in sound, enabling them to reason about spatial relationships, motion effects, and signal propagation characteristics.

## Key Results
- 0.924 accuracy in LOS detection, demonstrating strong capability in identifying direct line-of-sight conditions
- 0.181 MAE in Doppler estimation, showing precise measurement of frequency shifts due to motion
- 0.907 MAE in DoA estimation, indicating accurate determination of direction of arrival for sound sources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by translating physical phenomena into their acoustic manifestations, which LLMs can learn to recognize and reason about. By processing both magnitude and phase information from audio signals, the models capture the full spectral content necessary to understand complex physical interactions. The physics-based simulator ensures that the training data accurately represents real-world physical principles, allowing the models to develop genuine understanding rather than surface-level pattern matching. The combination of synthetic data generation with comprehensive QA pairs enables the LLMs to learn both the physical principles and how to apply them in practical scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- Doppler Effect: Why needed - To understand frequency shifts caused by relative motion between source and observer; Quick check - Can the model correctly identify approaching vs. receding sources from audio alone
- Multipath Propagation: Why needed - To recognize how signals reflect and interfere, creating complex acoustic signatures; Quick check - Can the model distinguish direct vs. reflected paths in audio
- Direction of Arrival (DoA): Why needed - To determine spatial relationships and source localization; Quick check - Can the model accurately estimate the angle of incoming sound
- Line-of-Sight (LOS) Detection: Why needed - To identify when direct signal paths exist vs. when occlusion occurs; Quick check - Can the model differentiate between clear and blocked signal paths
- Range Estimation: Why needed - To determine distance based on signal attenuation and propagation characteristics; Quick check - Can the model estimate distance from audio intensity and frequency content

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Physics simulator -> Audio encoder (magnitude+phase) -> LLM training with AQA-PHY dataset -> Task evaluation
Critical path: Synthetic audio generation → Feature extraction → LLM fine-tuning → Task-specific inference
Design tradeoffs: Synthetic data ensures controlled, diverse physical scenarios but may lack real-world noise characteristics; processing both magnitude and phase provides comprehensive signal information but increases computational complexity
Failure signatures: Poor performance on tasks involving occlusion or complex multipath suggests limitations in spatial reasoning; degraded accuracy in noisy conditions indicates sensitivity to environmental factors
First experiments: 1) Test LOS detection accuracy on simple direct path scenarios; 2) Evaluate Doppler estimation on single moving source cases; 3) Assess DoA estimation with known source positions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance has not been validated on real-world acoustic datasets with ambient noise and reverberation
- The framework's ability to handle complex multipath effects and occlusion scenarios remains untested
- Questions exist about whether models trained exclusively on synthetic data can generalize to naturally occurring sounds

## Confidence
- Core claim (LLMs can be taught physical awareness through sound): Medium - Methodology is sound but lacks real-world validation
- Specific performance metrics: Medium - Based on synthetic data that may not represent real-world acoustic complexities
- Framework generalizability: Low - Limited testing beyond controlled simulator environment

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on real-world acoustic datasets with ambient noise, reverberation, and unpredictable environmental factors to assess robustness
2. Evaluate cross-dataset generalization by training on AQA-PHY and testing on established audio physics benchmarks like PhyAVBench
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of phase information versus magnitude information in the audio encoder to better understand the framework's design choices
