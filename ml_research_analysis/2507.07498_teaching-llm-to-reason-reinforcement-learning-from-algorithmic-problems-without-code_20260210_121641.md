core_contribution: This paper introduces TeaR, a method that teaches large language
  models (LLMs) to reason better by using reinforcement learning on algorithmic problems
  without providing code. Unlike approaches that rely on code-based reasoning patterns,
  TeaR encourages models to autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies for
  algorithmic tasks.

# Teaching LLM to Reason: Reinforcement Learning from Algorithmic Problems without Code
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.07498
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07498
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RL-based method improves reasoning on algorithmic problems without code, showing 35.9% gain on Qwen2.5-7B

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TeaR, a reinforcement learning method that teaches large language models to reason better on algorithmic problems without relying on code-based reasoning patterns. The approach uses carefully curated algorithmic problems and a rule-based reward system based on exact match outputs to guide model exploration. Unlike code-specialized approaches, TeaR encourages models to autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks with model sizes from 1.5B to 32B parameters show consistent performance improvements, with particularly strong results on 7B-parameter models.

## Method Summary
TeaR employs reinforcement learning to teach LLMs reasoning capabilities on algorithmic problems without providing code templates. The method uses a carefully curated dataset of algorithmic problems from platforms like LeetCode, combined with a rule-based reward system that provides feedback based on exact match outputs. During training, models explore different reasoning paths and receive rewards for solutions that match expected outputs exactly. The approach is model-agnostic and was tested across various model sizes from 1.5B to 32B parameters, demonstrating consistent improvements in reasoning performance across multiple benchmark categories including math, knowledge, code, and logical reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- TeaR achieves 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B
- Consistent performance gains observed across 17 benchmarks with models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters
- Outperforms both base models and code-specialized models on algorithmic reasoning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind TeaR's effectiveness lies in its reinforcement learning framework that encourages exploration of reasoning strategies without code crutches. By providing exact match rewards based on problem outputs, the method guides models to discover optimal reasoning paths autonomously. The rule-based reward system creates clear feedback signals that help models refine their reasoning approaches over time. The use of diverse algorithmic problems provides varied challenges that push models to develop generalizable reasoning capabilities rather than memorizing specific patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- Reinforcement Learning (why needed: Enables models to learn optimal reasoning strategies through trial and error; quick check: Verify RL loss converges during training)
- Algorithmic Problem Solving (why needed: Provides structured reasoning challenges for model development; quick check: Ensure problem difficulty matches model capacity)
- Rule-based Reward Systems (why needed: Provides clear feedback for model optimization; quick check: Validate reward consistency across similar problem types)
- Exact Match Evaluation (why needed: Enables precise measurement of reasoning correctness; quick check: Test against ground truth outputs for accuracy)
- Exploration vs Exploitation Tradeoff (why needed: Balances trying new reasoning paths with refining known strategies; quick check: Monitor entropy of reasoning patterns over training)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Algorithmic Problems -> Reward System -> RL Policy -> LLM Backbone
Critical Path: Problem input → LLM reasoning → Output generation → Exact match evaluation → Reward calculation → Policy update
Design Tradeoffs: Rule-based rewards provide clear feedback but may struggle with problems having multiple valid solutions
Failure Signatures: Models may get stuck in local optima, fail to generalize beyond training problems, or show inconsistent reasoning patterns
First Experiments: 1) Test baseline performance without RL, 2) Validate exact match reward accuracy, 3) Measure training stability across different model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the reasoning improvements observed with TeaR be sustained or improved when applied to models significantly larger than 32 billion parameters?
- Basis in paper: The authors state in the Limitations section that their backbone models were restricted to 32B parameters, leaving it "uncertain and untested" whether larger models sustain the conclusions.
- Why unresolved: The study was limited by computational resources or availability, restricting experiments to the 1.5B–32B range.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results applying TeaR to models with 70B+ parameters (e.g., Llama-3-70B) showing consistent performance gains over baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does TeaR retain its effectiveness when applied to datasets with higher complexity and greater diversity than the current LeetCode-based collection?
- Basis in paper: The authors note in the Limitations that the seed datasets from LeetCode have "limitations in terms of complexity and diversity" and the difficulty level may not pose significant challenges to advanced LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The current data curation relied on existing algorithmic platforms which may be saturated or insufficiently difficult for frontier models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of TeaR on newly curated, high-difficulty algorithmic tasks or distinct domains outside of standard coding competitions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do smaller parameter models (e.g., 1.5B) show only minor improvements with TeaR compared to the significant gains observed in larger models?
- Basis in paper: In Section 4.2, the authors observe that the distilled-1.5B model shows "relatively minor improvements across the board," hypothesizing that larger models possess stronger generalization capabilities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate if the bottleneck is due to small model capacity to hold reasoning strategies or the difficulty of the RL exploration process for smaller models.
- What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study comparing the learned reasoning paths of 1.5B vs. 7B/32B models to identify where the reasoning logic fails or diverges.

## Limitations
- Exact match rewards may not generalize to tasks requiring approximate or partial solutions
- Performance gains vary significantly across different model architectures (35.9% vs 5.9% improvement)
- Evaluation focuses on algorithmic reasoning, leaving unclear whether improvements transfer to broader reasoning domains

## Confidence
- Performance improvements: Medium
- Generalization beyond algorithmic tasks: Low
- Specific contributions of RL components: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test TeaR's performance on non-algorithmic reasoning tasks to assess generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing rule-based rewards versus alternative reward formulations
3. Evaluate performance on problems with multiple valid solutions to assess robustness of the exact match reward system
