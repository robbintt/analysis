# Enhancing Automatic Term Extraction with Large Language Models via Syntactic Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2506.21222
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21222
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** Syntactic retrieval improves LLM-based ATE, especially in cross-domain and low-resource scenarios where lexical overlap is minimal.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) using Large Language Models (LLMs), where existing approaches relying on semantic similarity for retrieving demonstration examples often fail due to limited lexical overlap. The authors propose a syntactic retrieval method that selects structurally aligned demonstrations based on parse tree similarity, using FastKASSIM, to guide LLM-based ATE. Evaluated on three benchmarks (ACTER, ACLR2, BCGM) across cross-domain and in-domain settings, syntactic retrieval consistently improves F1-score, especially in low-resource or cross-domain scenarios where term overlap is minimal. The introduced Term Overlap Ratio (TOR) shows syntactic retrieval achieves high performance even without retrieving sentences containing gold terms, unlike semantic/lexical methods. While PLMs still outperform LLMs in in-domain settings, LLMs with syntactic retrieval match PLM performance in cross-domain tasks, highlighting the importance of syntactic cues for robust LLM adaptation to ATE.

## Method Summary
The method tackles few-shot ATE by retrieving demonstration examples for LLM prompting based on syntactic similarity rather than semantic or lexical similarity. First, constituency parse trees are generated for all sentences in the training (demonstration) and test (query) sets using an unlexicalized PCFG parser. Next, FastKASSIM (a label-based tree kernel) computes syntactic similarity between parse trees to retrieve the top-10 demonstrations for each query. These retrieved demonstrations are formatted into a prompt using a predefined template (Appendix B) and fed to an LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-IT, Gemma-2-9B-IT, or Mistral-Nemo) with greedy decoding. Performance is measured using strict micro F1-score (exact match, no normalization) with bootstrapping for confidence intervals. This approach is evaluated on ACTER (English subset, cross-domain), ACLR2, and BCGM datasets, showing improved performance especially when lexical overlap between domains is low.

## Key Results
- Syntactic retrieval consistently improves F1-score in both cross-domain and in-domain ATE tasks.
- In cross-domain settings, syntactic retrieval enables LLMs to match or exceed PLM performance, despite minimal lexical overlap.
- Term Overlap Ratio (TOR) analysis reveals that syntactic retrieval maintains high performance even without retrieving gold term-containing sentences, unlike semantic/lexical methods.
- Unlexicalized PCFG parsing is crucial; neural parsers degrade performance, as confirmed by ablation in Appendix C.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The key insight is that syntactic structure captures meaningful patterns for term extraction that lexical overlap misses, especially across domains. In cross-domain ATE, gold terms rarely appear in demonstration sentences, so semantic/lexical retrieval fails to find relevant examples. Syntactic retrieval circumvents this by matching the structural patterns of term usage rather than the terms themselves. This allows LLMs to learn from structurally similar contexts, even when the actual vocabulary differs, thereby improving generalization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Constituency Parse Trees:** Hierarchical syntactic structure of sentences, needed for syntactic similarity computation; quick check: can you visualize the tree for a sample sentence?
- **Tree Kernels (FastKASSIM):** Methods for comparing tree structures; quick check: can you compute similarity between two simple parse trees?
- **Unlexicalized PCFG Parsing:** Grammar-based parsing without word-specific features; quick check: can you configure Stanford Parser in unlexicalized mode?
- **Top-K Retrieval:** Selecting the K most similar demonstrations for prompting; quick check: can you retrieve top-10 examples given a similarity score list?
- **Greedy Decoding:** Sequential token selection by maximum probability; quick check: can you describe the difference between greedy and beam search?
- **Micro F1-score (Exact Match):** Evaluation metric for term extraction; quick check: can you compute F1-score for a small set of predicted vs. gold terms?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Training sentences (parsed) -> Syntactic Similarity (FastKASSIM) -> Top-10 Demonstrations -> Prompt Template -> LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-IT/Gemma-2-9B-IT/Mistral-Nemo) -> Greedy Decoding -> Predicted Terms -> Exact Match F1-score

**Critical Path**
Parse trees → FastKASSIM similarity → Top-10 retrieval → Prompt generation → LLM inference → F1 evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- **Syntactic vs. Semantic Retrieval:** Syntactic retrieval works better in cross-domain, low-resource scenarios but may miss semantic nuances.
- **Unlexicalized PCFG vs. Neural Parser:** Unlexicalized parser is crucial for consistent syntactic patterns; neural parsers may introduce domain bias.
- **Exact Match vs. Normalization:** Strict evaluation is fairer for cross-domain but may underestimate real-world performance.

**Failure Signatures**
- Parser mismatch (neural vs. unlexicalized) leads to degraded retrieval and lower F1.
- Semantic/lexical retrieval fails when lexical overlap is low.
- Over-reliance on normalization during evaluation inflates metrics but misrepresents cross-domain robustness.

**First Experiments**
1. Parse a small set of sentences from ACTER using both unlexicalized PCFG and a neural parser; compare parse trees.
2. Compute syntactic similarity between two parsed sentences using FastKASSIM; verify expected results.
3. Retrieve top-10 demonstrations for a query sentence using syntactic similarity; inspect retrieved examples for relevance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper does not provide implementation details for FastKASSIM or exact parser configuration, making faithful reproduction challenging.
- Strict exact match evaluation without normalization may not reflect real-world ATE scenarios where term variants are common.
- The cross-domain performance gains may be influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and are not universally validated.

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core methodology of using syntactic similarity (via parse tree kernels) for demonstration retrieval is clearly specified and internally consistent. The reported performance improvements in cross-domain settings are plausible given the limited lexical overlap in such scenarios.
- **Medium confidence:** The ablation studies (parser choice, normalization) are referenced but not fully detailed in the main text. The Term Overlap Ratio (TOR) metric is introduced but its broader applicability is unclear.
- **Low confidence:** Exact reproduction of results is uncertain due to unspecified implementation details for FastKASSIM and parser configuration.

## Next Checks
1. Reimplement FastKASSIM and verify syntactic similarity scores using the same parse trees on a small subset of ACTER to ensure alignment with reported retrieval patterns.
2. Run a controlled ablation comparing unlexicalized PCFG parser vs. a neural parser on a held-out validation set to confirm the parser choice is critical as claimed.
3. Test evaluation robustness by recomputing F1-scores with and without minor term normalizations (e.g., lowercasing) to quantify the impact of strict matching on reported performance.
