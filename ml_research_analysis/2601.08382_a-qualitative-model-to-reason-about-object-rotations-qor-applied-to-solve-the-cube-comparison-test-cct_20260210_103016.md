# A Qualitative Model to Reason about Object Rotations (QOR) applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08382
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08382
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: A qualitative reasoning framework (QOR) for object rotations applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Qualitative model for Reasoning about Object Rotations (QOR) that is applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT) developed by Ekstrom et al. (1976). The model constructs a conceptual neighborhood graph relating Rotation movement to Location change and Orientation change (CN GRLO) of features on cube sides, producing composition tables to calculate inferences for reasoning about rotations. The CCT consists of 21 items where participants must determine if two cubes viewed from different perspectives could be the same object, marking "s" if they could be the same or "d" for different.

## Method Summary
The method involves building a conceptual neighborhood graph (CN GRLO) that maps the relationships between rotation movements and changes in location and orientation of cube features. This graph is used to generate composition tables that enable the calculation of spatial inferences necessary for reasoning about object rotations. The framework translates these qualitative spatial relations into a systematic approach for solving the Cube Comparison Test problems, where participants must determine whether two differently oriented cubes represent the same object or different objects.

## Key Results
- QOR framework successfully translates rotation reasoning into a systematic compositional approach
- CN GRLO graph effectively relates rotation movements to location and orientation changes
- The model provides a theoretical basis for solving CCT problems through qualitative spatial reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The QOR framework works by abstracting complex spatial transformations into qualitative relationships that can be composed and reasoned about systematically. By representing rotations as changes in location and orientation through the CN GRLO graph, the model can infer whether two cube perspectives could represent the same object without requiring exact geometric calculations. The composition tables derived from the graph allow for systematic reasoning about how features on cube faces change relative to each other during rotations.

## Foundational Learning
- Qualitative spatial reasoning: Abstracting continuous spatial phenomena into discrete symbolic representations; needed to handle complex rotations without exact measurements; quick check: Can the model distinguish between different types of rotations using qualitative descriptors?
- Conceptual neighborhood graphs: Representing spatial relationships as nodes and edges in a graph structure; needed to capture the relationships between different rotation states; quick check: Does the graph maintain consistent relationships across different rotation scenarios?
- Composition tables: Systematic representation of how spatial relations combine; needed to enable inference about sequential rotations; quick check: Are the composition rules complete and consistent for all possible rotation combinations?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: CN GRLO graph -> Composition tables -> Rotation inference engine -> CCT problem solver
- Critical path: The conceptual neighborhood graph construction and composition table generation are the most critical components, as errors here propagate through all subsequent reasoning
- Design tradeoffs: Qualitative vs quantitative representation (simplicity and interpretability vs precision); graph-based vs rule-based inference (flexibility vs efficiency)
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent composition tables, incomplete CN GRLO graph, inability to handle edge cases in CCT problems
- First experiments: 1) Verify CN GRLO graph correctly represents all rotation scenarios; 2) Test composition table accuracy for basic rotation combinations; 3) Validate inference engine on simple CCT problems before full implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No empirical validation against human performance data from original CCT
- Theoretical framework lacks quantitative evaluation metrics for accuracy and efficiency
- Connection between qualitative relations and CCT constraints needs clarification

## Confidence
- QOR can effectively solve CCT problems: Medium
- The theoretical framework is internally consistent but lacks empirical demonstration
- More validation needed to confirm alignment with human spatial reasoning

## Next Checks
1. Implement QOR algorithm and test against comprehensive set of CCT problems, comparing results with published human performance data
2. Conduct systematic error analysis to identify scenarios where model produces incorrect inferences or fails to capture human spatial reasoning nuances
3. Perform comparative study against established spatial reasoning frameworks to evaluate advantages in accuracy, computational efficiency, or explanatory power
