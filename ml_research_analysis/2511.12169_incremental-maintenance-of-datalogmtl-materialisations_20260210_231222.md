# Incremental Maintenance of DatalogMTL Materialisations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.12169
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12169
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals that efficiently updates materialisations when datasets change.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents DRedMTL, an innovative incremental reasoning algorithm designed to efficiently maintain materialisations in DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Unlike traditional approaches that recompute materialisations from scratch upon dataset changes, DRedMTL leverages the DRed algorithm framework and employs periodic representations to capture recurring temporal patterns. This approach enables efficient updates when datasets are modified, addressing a critical need in temporal reasoning systems where datasets are frequently updated.

The algorithm demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline rematerialisation approaches, achieving speedups of up to 121× for small updates and 43.8× for large insertions, particularly in highly recursive cases. DRedMTL employs specialized operators for seminaïve evaluation and period identification to handle dynamic updates efficiently. The experimental validation on three public datasets demonstrates the practical utility and scalability of the approach for real-world temporal reasoning applications.

## Method Summary
DRedMTL builds upon the DRed algorithm framework to provide incremental reasoning capabilities for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. The core innovation lies in using periodic representations of materialisations to capture recurring temporal patterns, which allows the algorithm to efficiently update these representations when datasets change rather than recomputing from scratch. The approach employs specialized operators for seminaïve evaluation, a technique that optimizes the computation of new facts by only considering relevant derivations.

The algorithm integrates period identification mechanisms that analyze temporal patterns within the data to determine optimal representations. When updates occur, DRedMTL uses these periodic representations to efficiently propagate changes through the materialisation, focusing computational resources only on affected regions. This targeted approach contrasts sharply with rematerialisation baselines that must reprocess the entire dataset. The design particularly excels in highly recursive cases where traditional approaches suffer from computational explosion.

## Key Results
- DRedMTL achieves speedups of up to 121× for small updates compared to rematerialisation baselines
- For large insertions, the algorithm demonstrates 43.8× performance improvement
- The approach shows particular effectiveness in highly recursive cases where traditional methods struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DRedMTL works by exploiting temporal periodicity in data to minimize redundant computation during updates. The algorithm maintains materialisations using compact periodic representations that encode recurring temporal patterns, allowing it to focus updates only on affected regions rather than recomputing entire materialisations. This targeted approach leverages seminaïve evaluation principles to efficiently identify and process only the derivations impacted by dataset changes.

The period identification mechanism is crucial for determining optimal representations that balance compression efficiency with update performance. By analyzing temporal patterns in the data, DRedMTL can precompute and store these patterns, enabling rapid propagation of changes through the materialisation graph. The integration of DRed algorithm principles ensures that the approach maintains correctness while achieving significant computational savings through incremental updates.

## Foundational Learning
**DatalogMTL with Bounded Intervals**: A temporal logic that extends Datalog with temporal operators and bounded intervals, enabling reasoning about time-constrained facts. Why needed: Provides the foundation for expressing temporal relationships in the dataset. Quick check: Verify that temporal facts can be expressed with bounded intervals using the syntax.

**Materialisation**: The process of computing and storing all derivable facts from a Datalog program. Why needed: Represents the complete knowledge base derived from rules and facts. Quick check: Confirm that all facts derivable from given rules and initial facts are present.

**Semiaïve Evaluation**: An optimization technique that computes only new facts by tracking differences between iterations rather than recomputing all derivations. Why needed: Dramatically reduces computational overhead during reasoning. Quick check: Compare fact derivation counts between naïve and seminaïve approaches.

**Periodic Representations**: Compact encoding of recurring temporal patterns in materialisations to reduce storage and computation. Why needed: Enables efficient updates by exploiting temporal regularities. Quick check: Identify repeating temporal patterns in sample data.

**Incremental Reasoning**: Approaches that update derived knowledge when base facts change rather than recomputing from scratch. Why needed: Essential for responsive systems with frequently changing data. Quick check: Measure update time versus full recomputation time.

**Period Identification**: Analysis techniques that detect and characterize recurring temporal patterns in data. Why needed: Enables construction of efficient periodic representations. Quick check: Verify detected periods align with actual data patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
DRedMTL -> Period Identification -> Periodic Materialisation -> Update Propagation -> Materialisation Store

Critical Path:
Initial dataset and rules -> Period Identification -> Periodic Materialisation construction -> Update trigger -> Change detection -> Targeted update propagation -> Updated materialisation

Design Tradeoffs:
The algorithm trades additional memory overhead for periodic representations against computational savings during updates. This represents a classic space-time tradeoff where more memory enables faster updates. The approach assumes sufficient temporal regularity in data to justify periodic representation overhead, which may not hold for all datasets. Additionally, the complexity of period identification adds preprocessing cost that must be amortized across multiple updates.

Failure Signatures:
Performance degradation when datasets lack temporal regularity, making periodic representations inefficient. Memory exhaustion when materialisations become too large for available resources. Update anomalies when period identification fails to capture all relevant temporal patterns. Incorrect results if the incremental update propagation misses dependencies due to complex cyclic relationships.

First Experiments:
1. Measure execution time for updating materialisation with a small insertion (1-5 facts) compared to full rematerialisation
2. Test period identification accuracy on datasets with known periodic patterns versus irregular temporal data
3. Evaluate memory consumption of periodic representations versus classical materialisation across varying dataset sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to three public datasets, potentially not representing diverse real-world scenarios
- No comparison with other incremental reasoning approaches beyond rematerialisation baseline
- Does not thoroughly explore edge cases like highly concurrent updates or complex cyclic dependencies
- Algorithm assumes sufficient temporal regularity to justify periodic representation overhead
- Memory consumption characteristics not discussed for large materialisations
