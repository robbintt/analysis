# Adapting Vision-Language Models Without Labels: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.05547
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05547
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of unsupervised adaptation methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), introducing a novel taxonomy based on unlabeled visual data availability

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of unsupervised adaptation methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLMs to downstream tasks without labeled data. The authors systematically categorize existing approaches into four distinct paradigms based on the availability of unlabeled visual data: Data-Free Transfer, Unsupervised Domain Transfer, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation, and Online Test-Time Adaptation. For each paradigm, the survey details various methodologies including text augmentation, image utilization, network modification, self-training, entropy optimization, external resource utilization, and distribution modeling. The work also reviews representative benchmarks across diverse applications such as object classification, semantic segmentation, visual reasoning, and out-of-distribution detection.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic approach to categorize and analyze unsupervised VLM adaptation methods. The authors develop a novel taxonomy based on unlabeled visual data availability, organizing existing approaches into four paradigms. Within each paradigm, they provide detailed analysis of methodologies, including specific techniques like text augmentation for data-free transfer, self-training for domain transfer, and entropy optimization for test-time adaptation. The survey also reviews representative benchmarks and applications, providing a structured overview of the field's current state and future directions.

## Key Results
- Novel taxonomy categorizing unsupervised VLM adaptation into four paradigms based on unlabeled visual data availability
- Comprehensive coverage of methodologies including text augmentation, self-training, and entropy optimization across different adaptation scenarios
- Systematic review of benchmarks and applications spanning object classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection
- Identification of open challenges and promising future research directions in unsupervised VLM adaptation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's effectiveness stems from its systematic organization of a rapidly evolving field. By creating a taxonomy based on the availability of unlabeled visual data, the authors provide a clear framework for understanding different adaptation scenarios and their corresponding methodologies. This structure allows researchers to quickly identify relevant approaches for their specific use cases and understand the relationships between different techniques. The comprehensive coverage of both methodologies and benchmarks ensures that readers gain a holistic understanding of the current state of unsupervised VLM adaptation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs):** Pre-trained models that understand both visual and textual information, serving as the foundation for adaptation tasks. Why needed: These models form the base upon which all adaptation techniques build. Quick check: Verify understanding of how VLMs like CLIP or BLIP operate.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Training methods that don't require labeled data, essential for the survey's focus. Why needed: Most downstream adaptation scenarios lack labeled data. Quick check: Understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms.
- **Domain Adaptation:** The process of adapting models trained on one domain to perform well on another domain. Why needed: Many adaptation scenarios involve domain shifts between source and target data. Quick check: Recognize examples of domain adaptation problems.
- **Test-Time Adaptation:** Adapting models during inference without additional training data. Why needed: Critical for real-world deployment where retraining isn't feasible. Quick check: Understand the distinction between training-time and test-time adaptation.
- **Self-Training:** Using model predictions to generate pseudo-labels for further training. Why needed: Enables iterative improvement without external labels. Quick check: Know how pseudo-label generation works in practice.
- **Entropy Optimization:** Techniques that encourage model confidence in predictions. Why needed: Helps improve model performance in unsupervised settings. Quick check: Understand entropy as a measure of prediction uncertainty.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Data Sources (Labeled/Unlabeled) -> Adaptation Paradigm Selection -> Methodology Application -> Performance Evaluation
**Critical Path:** Unlabeled Visual Data Availability → Paradigm Selection → Appropriate Methodology Application → Performance Validation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Data availability vs. adaptation effectiveness, computational resources vs. adaptation speed, model complexity vs. generalization
**Failure Signatures:** Poor adaptation when paradigm selection doesn't match data availability, overfitting when unlabeled data is insufficient, computational constraints preventing real-time adaptation
**First Experiments:**
1. Implement text augmentation techniques on a simple VLM for data-free transfer scenario
2. Apply self-training methodology to domain adaptation with unlabeled target data
3. Test entropy optimization techniques for online test-time adaptation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey highlights several open challenges in unsupervised VLM adaptation, including the need for more robust methods that can handle extreme domain shifts, techniques that can effectively utilize limited unlabeled data, and approaches that balance computational efficiency with adaptation effectiveness. The authors also point to the need for standardized evaluation protocols and benchmarks that better reflect real-world deployment scenarios.

## Limitations
- The taxonomy based on unlabeled visual data availability may not capture all possible adaptation scenarios, particularly hybrid approaches that combine multiple paradigms
- Analysis relies heavily on published works, potentially missing unpublished or emerging techniques
- Survey coverage of benchmarks may not fully represent the latest developments in all application domains

## Confidence
**Major Claims and Confidence Levels:**
- **Novelty of the proposed taxonomy** - High confidence: The four-paradigm classification appears to be a reasonable and useful framework for organizing existing approaches
- **Comprehensiveness of methodology coverage** - Medium confidence: While the survey covers major approaches, some niche or emerging techniques may be underrepresented
- **Benchmark analysis and applications** - Medium confidence: The survey reviews representative benchmarks, but the rapidly evolving nature of VLM research means some newer benchmarks may not be fully captured

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic literature review to identify any significant adaptation approaches that may not fit neatly into the proposed taxonomy, particularly hybrid methods
2. Perform a comparative analysis of the performance of different adaptation paradigms across a standardized set of benchmarks to validate the practical utility of the taxonomy
3. Survey recent conference proceedings and preprints to identify emerging trends and techniques in unsupervised VLM adaptation that may not be covered in the survey
