- Primary result: Novel soft gradient boosting framework with learnable feature transforms that improves performance in high-dimensional, data-scarce sequential regression scenarios

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a soft gradient boosting framework that integrates learnable linear feature transforms within the boosting procedure for sequential regression tasks. The method trains soft decision trees at each iteration while jointly learning linear input transformations, enabling embedded feature selection and transformation capabilities. This approach is particularly effective in high-dimensional scenarios with limited data, where it discovers relevant input representations while avoiding overfitting. The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements over standard boosting approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with open-source code provided for reproducibility.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines soft decision trees with learnable linear feature transforms in a sequential boosting framework. At each boosting iteration, the algorithm trains a soft decision tree to capture non-linear relationships while simultaneously learning a linear transformation of the input features. This joint learning process enables the model to perform feature selection and transformation as part of the boosting procedure itself. The soft decision tree approach provides differentiable approximations to discrete tree decisions, allowing for end-to-end training. The method is designed to be particularly effective in scenarios with high-dimensional feature spaces and limited training data, where traditional boosting methods may struggle with overfitting or fail to identify relevant features.

## Key Results
- Significant performance gains over standard boosting methods on synthetic and real-world datasets in high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios
- Successful integration of feature selection and transformation within the boosting procedure through joint learning of soft decision trees and linear transforms
- Open-source implementation provided for reproducibility and further research
- Proposed extensions to differentiable non-linear transforms, though empirical validation is limited

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by combining the representational power of soft decision trees with the dimensionality reduction capabilities of learnable linear transforms. The soft decision trees capture complex non-linear relationships in the data through differentiable approximations of tree structures, while the linear transforms learn optimal feature representations that highlight relevant information and suppress noise. This joint optimization allows the model to adaptively select and transform features during the boosting process, effectively reducing the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. The sequential nature of the boosting framework ensures that each subsequent weak learner focuses on the residual errors of previous learners, while the embedded feature transformation helps each learner work with more informative representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Soft decision trees**: Differentiable approximations of decision tree structures that allow gradient-based optimization - needed for end-to-end training within boosting framework; quick check: verify gradient flow through tree structure
- **Sequential boosting**: Iterative procedure where weak learners are trained on residuals of previous learners - needed for gradual error reduction; quick check: monitor residual error decay across iterations
- **Feature transformation**: Linear operations that project input features to new spaces - needed for dimensionality reduction and feature selection; quick check: analyze learned transformation matrices for sparsity patterns
- **Gradient-based optimization**: Use of gradients to update model parameters - needed for training soft decision trees and linear transforms; quick check: verify convergence of parameter updates
- **High-dimensional regression**: Regression tasks with many input features - needed to demonstrate method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios; quick check: measure performance degradation as dimensionality increases

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Linear Transform -> Soft Decision Tree -> Residual Calculation -> Next Iteration -> Final Prediction

**Critical Path**: The core algorithm iteratively applies: (1) linear feature transformation learning, (2) soft decision tree training on transformed features, (3) residual calculation, and (4) ensemble prediction update. Each iteration depends on the previous iteration's residuals, creating a sequential dependency chain.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (due to soft decision trees and joint optimization) for improved performance in high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios. The soft decision tree approach provides differentiability but may be slower than hard trees. The joint learning of transforms and trees enables feature selection but increases the parameter space.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include: (1) overfitting in very high-dimensional spaces if regularization is insufficient, (2) slow convergence if the linear transforms fail to find useful feature representations, (3) computational bottlenecks due to the complexity of training soft decision trees, and (4) poor performance if the sequential boosting process gets stuck in local minima.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Benchmark performance on synthetic high-dimensional regression problems with varying sample sizes to quantify the method's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios
2. Compare against standard boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM) on benchmark datasets to validate performance improvements
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of soft decision trees versus learnable transforms to overall performance gains
