# A Reproducible, Scalable Pipeline for Synthesizing Autoregressive Model Literature

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.04612
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04612
- **Authors:** Faruk Alpay; Bugra Kilictas; Hamdi Alakkad
- **Reference count:** 3
- **Primary result:** Fully automated pipeline achieving F1-scores above 0.85 for literature synthesis tasks and reproducing autoregressive model results within 1-3% of original reports

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive, automated pipeline for synthesizing literature on autoregressive generative models. The system retrieves papers from public repositories, processes them through multiple stages including parsing, filtering, metadata extraction, and topic clustering, then generates retrieval-augmented summaries and executable reproduction scripts. The pipeline addresses the growing challenge of keeping pace with rapidly expanding machine learning literature by automating the extraction and synthesis of key experimental details, hyperparameters, and results across thousands of papers.

The authors demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness through quantitative evaluation on 50 annotated papers, showing strong performance across all core tasks with F1-scores above 0.85. Scalability tests confirm near-linear processing time growth when handling up to 1,000 papers with eight CPU workers. Three reproduction case studies successfully recreated experimental results within 1-3% of original reports, validating the pipeline's practical utility for creating living surveys and enabling reproducible research across different autoregressive model domains.

## Method Summary
The pipeline implements a multi-stage automated workflow for literature synthesis, beginning with paper retrieval from repositories like arXiv and PubMed. It then applies parsing and filtering to identify relevant autoregressive model papers, followed by structured extraction of metadata, hyperparameters, and experimental results. The system employs topic clustering algorithms to organize papers thematically, generates retrieval-augmented summaries using large language models, and produces executable scripts for reproducing reported experiments. The architecture leverages distributed processing to handle large paper collections efficiently, with validation steps ensuring extracted information accuracy. The pipeline's modular design allows adaptation to different model categories and experimental domains while maintaining reproducibility standards.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1-scores above 0.85 for relevance classification, hyperparameter extraction, and citation identification on 50 annotated papers
- Demonstrated near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers when processing up to 1,000 papers
- Successfully reproduced three autoregressive model experiments within 1-3% of original reported perplexities
- Generated executable reproduction scripts that validated across diverse datasets including WikiText-2, WikiText-103, and Lakh MIDI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The pipeline succeeds through systematic automation of the entire literature synthesis pipeline, from retrieval to reproduction. By combining structured extraction techniques with retrieval-augmented generation, it captures both quantitative experimental details and qualitative insights from papers. The distributed architecture enables efficient processing of large paper collections, while the modular design allows adaptation to different model categories. The integration of reproducibility as a core feature—generating executable scripts rather than just summaries—ensures practical utility beyond literature review. The validation through reproduction case studies demonstrates that the pipeline can extract sufficient detail to recreate published results, establishing trust in the synthesized information.

## Foundational Learning
**Paper Retrieval and Filtering** - Automated collection from repositories like arXiv using keyword matching and relevance scoring; needed to build comprehensive datasets without manual curation, quick check: verify retrieval rate and false positive rate on test queries.

**Structured Information Extraction** - Rule-based and NLP techniques to parse metadata, hyperparameters, and results from paper text; required for converting unstructured research papers into machine-readable structured data, quick check: validate extraction accuracy against ground truth annotations.

**Topic Clustering** - Unsupervised algorithms (e.g., LDA, hierarchical clustering) to group papers by research themes; enables organization of large literature collections and identification of research trends, quick check: evaluate cluster coherence using silhouette scores or manual inspection.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** - Combining document retrieval with large language models to generate comprehensive summaries; provides context-aware synthesis that incorporates specific paper details, quick check: assess summary quality through ROUGE scores and human evaluation.

**Reproducibility Automation** - Converting extracted experimental details into executable code; bridges the gap between literature synthesis and practical implementation, quick check: verify generated scripts run successfully and reproduce reported metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Paper Retrieval -> Filtering -> Parsing -> Information Extraction -> Topic Clustering -> Summary Generation -> Reproduction Script Generation

**Critical Path:** The most time-consuming stages are paper retrieval (network-bound) and information extraction (CPU-intensive parsing), with summary generation requiring GPU resources for language model processing. The critical path for end-to-end synthesis involves successful completion of all extraction stages before summary generation can proceed.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The pipeline prioritizes accuracy over speed in information extraction, using multiple validation steps that increase processing time but improve reliability. The choice of rule-based extraction for structured data versus purely ML-based approaches trades development complexity for higher precision. The modular architecture enables parallel processing of different paper collections but requires careful coordination of intermediate outputs.

**Failure Signatures:** Retrieval failures manifest as incomplete paper collections or missing recent publications. Parsing errors appear as malformed extracted data or failed hyperparameter extraction. Topic clustering failures result in incoherent paper groupings or missed thematic connections. Summary generation failures produce generic or factually incorrect summaries. Reproduction script failures indicate incomplete or incorrect experimental detail extraction.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test paper retrieval with 100 keyword queries to validate coverage and relevance scoring, 2) Run information extraction on 10 annotated papers to measure accuracy against ground truth, 3) Execute reproduction script generation for one complete paper to verify executable output quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation performed on relatively small corpus of 50 annotated papers, limiting generalizability to broader literature domains
- Scalability tests only conducted up to 1,000 papers with eight CPU workers, leaving uncertainty about performance at larger scales
- Reproduction case studies limited to three specific models on established benchmark datasets, not testing pipeline on novel architectures or custom datasets

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Relevance classification performance (F1 > 0.85) on annotated test set
- **Medium confidence**: Hyperparameter extraction accuracy and citation identification performance
- **Medium confidence**: Scalability results on tested paper ranges (up to 1,000 papers)
- **Medium confidence**: Reproduction success on three case studies with established benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate pipeline performance on 500+ diverse papers across multiple ML domains (computer vision, reinforcement learning, multimodal models) to assess domain generalization
2. Conduct blind human evaluation comparing pipeline-generated literature summaries against expert-written surveys for coherence and completeness
3. Test pipeline on papers with incomplete experimental details or non-standard reporting formats to assess robustness to reporting variability
