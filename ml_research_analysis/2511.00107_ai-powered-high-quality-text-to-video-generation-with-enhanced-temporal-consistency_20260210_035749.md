# AI Powered High Quality Text to Video Generation with Enhanced Temporal Consistency

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.00107
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00107
- **Reference count:** 16
- **Primary result:** MOV AI achieves 15.3% LPIPS improvement, 12.7% FVD improvement, and 18.9% better user preference scores for text-to-video generation

## Executive Summary
MOV AI introduces a hierarchical framework for text-to-video generation that integrates compositional scene understanding with temporal-aware diffusion models. The approach features three innovations: a Compositional Scene Parser that decomposes text into hierarchical scene graphs with temporal annotations, a Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism that jointly models spatial relationships within frames and temporal dependencies across sequences, and a Progressive Video Refinement module that iteratively enhances video quality through multi-scale temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in perceptual quality and temporal consistency metrics.

## Method Summary
MOV AI is a three-module hierarchical framework for text-to-video generation. The Compositional Scene Parser (CSP) uses a 12-layer GNN to parse input text into hierarchical scene graphs with 15-20 nodes. The Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism (TSAM) employs 16-head attention with spatial, temporal, and cross-modal components to model frame relationships and text alignment. The Progressive Video Refinement (PVR) iteratively enhances video quality across three scales (128→256→512 resolution). The system generates 16 frames at 512×512 resolution, trained on WebVid-10M and other datasets for 72 hours on 8×A100 GPUs with 2.8B parameters.

## Key Results
- 15.3% improvement in LPIPS (0.124) over existing methods
- 12.7% improvement in FVD (299.2) demonstrating superior temporal consistency
- 18.9% better user preference scores in qualitative evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by decomposing the complex video generation task into specialized modules that handle different aspects of the problem. The CSP provides structured semantic understanding by converting text into scene graphs, enabling the model to reason about object relationships and temporal sequences. The TSAM's three-way attention mechanism allows the model to simultaneously process spatial relationships within frames, temporal dependencies across frames, and text-video alignment. The PVR's progressive refinement approach enables the model to gradually add detail while maintaining temporal coherence across scales. This hierarchical decomposition allows each module to specialize in its domain while the composite loss function ensures coherent integration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Scene Graphs:** Hierarchical representations of entities, relationships, and attributes extracted from text. Why needed: Provides structured semantic understanding for video generation. Quick check: Verify CSP produces coherent entity-relationship hierarchies from complex sentences.
- **Temporal-Spatial Attention:** Joint modeling of spatial relationships within frames and temporal dependencies across frames. Why needed: Captures both spatial coherence and temporal dynamics simultaneously. Quick check: Visualize attention weights to ensure TA is attending across frames.
- **Progressive Refinement:** Multi-scale generation approach that starts coarse and iteratively refines. Why needed: Enables stable training and maintains temporal consistency across scales. Quick check: Compare quality progression across PVR stages.
- **Cross-Modal Attention:** Attention mechanism conditioned on text embeddings. Why needed: Ensures generated videos align with textual descriptions. Quick check: Verify CLIP alignment scores remain high throughout training.
- **Diffusion Models:** Iterative denoising process for high-quality generation. Why needed: Produces state-of-the-art image and video quality. Quick check: Monitor reconstruction loss during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** CSP (Text → Scene Graph) → TSAM (Scene Graph + Noise → Refined Features) → PVR (Features → Video)

**Critical Path:** The most performance-sensitive path is CSP → TSAM → PVR, where errors compound if any module fails. The TSAM's three-way attention is the computational bottleneck requiring careful optimization.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The 16-frame limit balances temporal coherence with memory constraints. The 3-stage refinement provides quality gains but increases training time. The composite loss function enables multi-objective optimization but requires careful weight tuning.

**Failure Signatures:** Temporal flickering indicates TSAM temporal attention failure. Object morphing suggests PVR instability. Poor text alignment reveals CMA attention issues. OOM errors require resolution or batch size reduction.

**First Experiments:** 1) Test CSP with simple sentences to verify scene graph generation. 2) Validate TSAM with synthetic data to check attention mechanisms. 3) Run PVR on pre-generated features to isolate refinement quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Scalability to longer sequences:** The current implementation is limited to 16-frame sequences, with extending to longer sequences identified as future work. The hierarchical architecture may not scale well due to memory constraints and error accumulation in TSAM.
- **Performance in highly dynamic scenes:** The CSP shows particular challenges in highly dynamic scenes with complex lighting, where performance varies. The pre-trained language models may fail to ground textual concepts effectively when visual features are obscured.
- **Multimodal conditioning integration:** Investigation of multimodal conditioning (audio, sketches, reference images) is listed as future research. Additional modalities may destabilize the joint optimization of TSAM and PVR modules.

## Limitations
- Limited to 16-frame sequences, restricting applicability for longer video content
- Performance degradation in highly dynamic scenes with complex lighting conditions
- Missing implementation details for critical hyperparameters (loss weights, learning rate, diffusion schedule)

## Confidence
- **Quantitative performance claims:** Medium confidence - standard metrics but incomplete implementation details
- **Architectural innovations:** High confidence - components are clearly described and implementable
- **Qualitative capabilities:** Medium confidence - user study supports claims but methodology details are limited

## Next Checks
1. **Loss function ablation study:** Systematically vary λ₁, λ₂, λ₃ parameters to identify their impact on temporal consistency vs. semantic alignment, starting with λ₁=1.0, λ₂=0.5, λ₃=0.1 as initial guesses
2. **Module integration validation:** Train CSP, TSAM, and PVR modules separately first, then jointly, comparing performance at each stage to isolate whether gains come from individual components or their integration
3. **Resolution scaling analysis:** Verify that performance improvements hold at different resolutions (256×256 vs 512×512) to determine whether reported gains are resolution-dependent or architecture-driven
