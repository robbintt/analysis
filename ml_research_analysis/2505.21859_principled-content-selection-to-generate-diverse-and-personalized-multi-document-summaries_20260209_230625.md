- This paper proposes a three-step pipeline using determinantal point processes (DPPs) to improve source coverage and diversity in multi-document summaries by mitigating LLM attention biases

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical limitation in large language model-based multi-document summarization: attention biases that cause uneven coverage of source material. The authors propose a principled content selection approach that extracts atomic key points from documents, selects them using determinantal point processes to prioritize diversity and relevance, and then rewrites them into coherent summaries. The method consistently improves source coverage on the DIVERSESUMM benchmark across multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Claude-3-Sonnet, and Llama 3.1), outperforming both naive and LLM-only baselines. By incorporating user intent into the DPP kernel, the approach also generates personalized summaries with better relevance while maintaining high coverage.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of a three-step pipeline: First, atomic key points are extracted from each document using LLM prompting. Second, these key points are selected using determinantal point processes (DPPs), which balance diversity and relevance through a carefully constructed kernel function. The kernel incorporates both content similarity and user intent to ensure diverse yet relevant coverage. Finally, the selected key points are rewritten into a coherent multi-document summary. The DPP-based selection explicitly addresses the attention bias problem in LLMs by ensuring that no single document or topic dominates the summary, leading to more balanced representation of source material.

## Key Results
- The DPP-based content selection approach consistently improves source coverage on the DIVERSESUMM benchmark across four different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Claude-3-Sonnet, and Llama 3.1)
- Personalized summaries incorporating user intent into the DPP kernel show better relevance metrics while maintaining high coverage compared to generic summaries
- The method outperforms both naive baselines (selecting key points from random documents) and LLM-only approaches across all evaluated models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by explicitly addressing the attention bias problem inherent in LLMs when processing multiple documents. Rather than relying on the LLM's internal attention mechanisms to distribute coverage evenly across sources, the method first decomposes documents into atomic key points and then uses determinantal point processes to select a diverse and relevant subset. This principled selection ensures that underrepresented documents and topics receive appropriate coverage in the final summary. The DPP kernel function can be customized with user intent, allowing the selection process to prioritize content aligned with specific user needs while maintaining diversity.

## Foundational Learning

**Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs)**: Probabilistic models that capture negative correlations between items, promoting diversity in subset selection
*Why needed*: To mathematically formalize the trade-off between diversity and relevance when selecting key points from multiple documents
*Quick check*: Verify that selected subsets exhibit both high relevance to user intent and low pairwise similarity between key points

**Atomic Key Point Extraction**: Breaking down documents into discrete, self-contained units of information
*Why needed*: To create a manageable representation of source material that can be systematically selected and combined
*Quick check*: Ensure extracted key points are both complete (contain full ideas) and atomic (cannot be further decomposed without losing meaning)

**Kernel Functions in DPPs**: Mathematical functions that define the similarity and quality of items in the selection process
*Why needed*: To encode both content similarity and user intent into the selection criteria
*Quick check*: Confirm that the kernel function properly balances diversity (negative similarity) and relevance (quality scores)

**Attention Bias in LLMs**: The tendency of language models to focus disproportionately on certain documents or topics when processing multiple sources
*Why needed*: Understanding this problem motivates the need for explicit content selection rather than relying on LLM internal mechanisms
*Quick check*: Measure coverage distribution across source documents to quantify attention bias in baseline approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Document Collection -> Atomic Key Point Extraction -> DPP-Based Selection -> Summary Rewriting -> Output Summary

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming step is typically the DPP sampling process, which has cubic complexity in the number of key points. The quality of the final summary depends critically on the quality of atomic key point extraction, as errors at this stage propagate through selection and rewriting.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (DPP sampling is expensive) for improved coverage and diversity. Alternative approaches using simpler selection heuristics would be faster but less principled in balancing diversity and relevance.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor atomic key point extraction leads to redundant or incomplete selections; overly restrictive DPP kernels result in summaries that miss important content; aggressive diversity promotion can reduce relevance to user intent.

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare coverage distribution across source documents between baseline LLM summarization and the proposed method
2. Perform ablation study removing the user intent component from the DPP kernel to quantify its contribution to personalization
3. Test scalability by running the pipeline on document collections of increasing size (10, 50, 100 documents) to identify computational bottlenecks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- DPP-based selection may not scale efficiently to very large document collections due to cubic computational complexity
- Limited evaluation of user intent variations makes confidence in personalization component medium
- Quality of atomic key point extraction is critical but not extensively validated across different document types
- DIVERSESUMM benchmark may not fully represent real-world multi-document summarization scenarios in specialized domains

## Confidence

**Diversity Improvements**: High
**Personalization Quality**: Medium  
**Scalability**: Low
**Generalizability to New Domains**: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the DPP-based selection pipeline on additional benchmarks beyond DIVERSESUMM, including domain-specific datasets, to assess generalizability across different content types and user contexts

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the proposed method against alternative diversity-promoting techniques such as submodular optimization or contrastive learning approaches, to better understand the specific contribution of DPP-based selection

3. Perform a comprehensive scalability analysis by testing the pipeline with varying numbers of source documents (e.g., 10, 50, 100 documents) to identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate computational feasibility for large-scale applications
