# PosterGen: Aesthetic-Aware Paper-to-Poster Generation via Multi-Agent LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.17188
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17188
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Multi-agent LLM framework that generates aesthetic academic posters with comparable content fidelity to human design and significantly better aesthetic metrics than state-of-the-art PosterAgent

## Executive Summary
PosterGen is a multi-agent LLM framework for automatic academic poster generation that mirrors professional designer workflows through four specialized agents: Parser/Curator (extract and organize content into narrative), Layout (create spatially balanced three-column grid), Stylist (apply theme-based color and hierarchical typography), and Renderer (produce PPTX/PDF output). The framework integrates core design principles—narrative ABT structure, visual hierarchy, layout balance, color harmony, and typography. Evaluation via VLM-as-Judge shows PosterGen achieves comparable content fidelity to human design and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PosterAgent on aesthetic metrics (e.g., 4.44 vs 4.26 average design score). It produces presentation-ready posters with minimal manual refinement, addressing the need for automated, design-aware poster generation.

## Method Summary
PosterGen uses a sequential pipeline of four specialized agents to transform academic papers into posters. The Parser Agent converts PDF to Markdown and extracts visual assets. The Curator Agent distills content into an ABT narrative structure with 5-8 sections. The Layout Agent calculates spatial coordinates using a CSS-like box model with binary search for text height estimation to ensure balanced columns. The Stylist Agent extracts theme colors from affiliation logos or key figures and applies visual hierarchy. Finally, the Renderer generates PPTX files and converts them to PDF/PNG. The system enforces design constraints at each stage rather than relying on end-to-end generation.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable content fidelity to human-designed posters (4.6 vs 4.7 for "Conciseness" under GPT-4o evaluation)
- Significantly outperforms PosterAgent on aesthetic metrics (4.44 vs 4.26 average design score)
- Produces presentation-ready posters requiring minimal manual refinement
- Successfully applies professional design principles including narrative structure, visual hierarchy, and color harmony

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decomposing the poster generation task into specialized, sequential roles that mirror professional design workflows improves aesthetic fidelity compared to monolithic or general-purpose pipelines. PosterGen uses a cascade of four specialist agents that isolate constraints—narrative flow is solved before spatial arrangement, which is solved before color application. This reduces error accumulation common in end-to-end generative models.

### Mechanism 2
Using a calculated, deterministic spatial layout system (CSS-like box model + binary search for height) instead of generative heuristics minimizes visual overlap and improves reading flow. The Layout Agent computes layout using a Python implementation of a CSS box model with binary search to estimate final rendered height of text frames, compensating for discrepancies between the python-pptx library and final rendering engine.

### Mechanism 3
Extracting theme colors from source material (affiliation logos/key figures) and applying them via a constrained three-tier rule set (theme, monochromatic, contrast) creates superior visual harmony compared to generic styling. The Stylist Agent grounds the poster's palette in the source paper's identity by extracting a dominant color from the author's affiliation logo and generating a complete color scheme based on color theory principles.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration (Sequential Pipeline)**: Why needed here: PosterGen is not a single LLM call but a sequential pipeline of four distinct stages. Quick check question: If the Curator Agent fails to enforce the 5-8 section limit, which downstream agent's task becomes significantly harder? (Answer: The Layout Agent).

- **The ABT (And, But, Therefore) Narrative Structure**: Why needed here: The Parser and Curator agents use ABT to distill the paper's core message. Quick check question: In the ABT framework, which component defines the "research gap" that the poster's "Motivation" section must visually and textually highlight? (Answer: The "But" component).

- **Programmatic vs. Generative Layout**: Why needed here: The Layout Agent does not "hallucinate" a layout; it calculates it using a box model and binary search. Quick check question: Why does PosterGen use a binary search algorithm for text height estimation instead of prompting an LLM to "estimate the height"? (Answer: LLMs are poor at spatial arithmetic and predicting rendering engine behavior; programmatic simulation provides deterministic, reliable results).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input: Source PDF -> Parser Agent -> Curator Agent -> Layout Agent -> Stylist Agents -> Renderer
- **Critical path**: The Layout Agent's height estimation is the most fragile and critical step. If text heights are calculated incorrectly, the "balanced columns" constraint fails, leading to overflow or excessive white space.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes determinism and design principles (via calculated layout and rule-based color) over flexibility. This yields reliable, professional posters but may struggle with unconventional or highly creative layout requests.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Content extraction failure: The Parser Agent may miss key figures or text, resulting in a sparse or incomplete poster
  - Column imbalance: The Layout Agent's binary search may converge on an incorrect height, causing one column to be significantly shorter
  - Color washout: The Color Agent may extract a low-contrast color from a logo, making text highlights unreadable
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation on Layout Calculation: Replace binary search/box model with LLM-estimated height and run on 5 papers
  2. Stylist Grounding Test: Run Color Agent with and without access to affiliation logo and compare theme coherence scores
  3. Pipeline Stage Injection: Introduce deliberate JSON formatting error in Curator output and observe system behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can empowering the Curator Agent to generate new visual assets (e.g., flowcharts, concept diagrams) based on paper content improve poster communicative effectiveness compared to using only existing figures? Basis: Appendix E states current Curator is restricted to existing visual assets and suggests empowering it to generate visuals as a promising direction.

- **Open Question 2**: How robust is PosterGen to PDF parsing errors across diverse academic document formats, and what alternative parsing methods could improve extraction fidelity? Basis: Appendix E acknowledges Marker tool occasionally encounters extraction errors and suggests more robust PDF conversion tools would benefit future improvements.

- **Open Question 3**: How well does PosterGen generalize to non-AI scientific domains (e.g., biology, physics, social sciences) with different paper structures and visual conventions? Basis: Evaluation uses only papers from top-tier AI conferences (ICLR, ICML, AAAI, CVPR, NeurIPS), limiting generalizability to other scientific domains.

## Limitations

- **Rendering Engine Dependency**: The Layout Agent's height estimation relies on accurate simulation of the rendering engine's text wrapping behavior, with discrepancies between python-pptx's internal model and actual rendering engines remaining a potential failure point.

- **Content Extraction Robustness**: The Parser Agent's reliance on `marker-pdf` may struggle with papers containing complex layouts, non-standard figure placements, or low-quality PDFs, potentially resulting in incomplete content extraction.

- **Aesthetic Generalization**: The framework's aesthetic quality is grounded in academic poster conventions (three-column grid, specific typography rules) and may not generalize well to posters requiring highly creative or unconventional layouts.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The multi-agent decomposition mirrors professional design workflows and demonstrably improves content fidelity compared to monolithic approaches
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that binary search/box model approach specifically reduces visual overlap is supported by qualitative comparisons but would benefit from quantitative metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: The logo-based color scheme grounding improves theme coherence, though evidence relies on VLM evaluation rather than human aesthetic judgment

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Height Estimation**: Replace PosterGen's binary search layout with an LLM-based height estimation and evaluate the increase in layout balance violations and overflow errors across 10 papers.

2. **Content Extraction Stress Test**: Run PosterGen on a dataset of 20 papers with varying complexity (including multi-column layouts, embedded tables, and scanned figures) and measure the correlation between Parser Agent extraction completeness and final poster quality scores.

3. **Renderer Compatibility Audit**: Test PosterGen's generated PPTX files across different PowerPoint versions and LibreOffice builds to quantify variance in text wrapping and layout consistency, identifying specific rendering engine versions where height estimates fail.
