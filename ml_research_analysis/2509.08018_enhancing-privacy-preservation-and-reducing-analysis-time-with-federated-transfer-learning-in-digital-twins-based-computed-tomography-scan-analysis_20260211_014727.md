# Enhancing Privacy Preservation and Reducing Analysis Time with Federated Transfer Learning in Digital Twins-based Computed Tomography Scan Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.08018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08018
- Authors: Avais Jan; Qasim Zia; Murray Patterson
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: FTL framework achieves 0.8730 accuracy on 4-class CT scan classification, outperforming FL (0.8000) and CFL (0.8476)

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) framework that combines pre-trained DenseNet-121 models with federated learning to enable privacy-preserving CT scan analysis across multiple hospitals. The approach leverages Digital Twins to maintain virtual replicas of CT scanners, enabling local inference while the FTL pipeline handles periodic model updates. Using a chest CT scan dataset with four cancer types, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy (0.8730) compared to conventional Federated Learning (0.8000) and Clustered Federated Learning (0.8476), while addressing critical challenges of data privacy and computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The FTL framework uses pre-trained DenseNet-121 initialized with CheXpert weights, partitioned across simulated hospital clients with non-IID data distributions. Local fine-tuning occurs on each hospital's Digital Twin replica, with sequential cycling aggregation replacing standard parallel FedAvg. The central server maintains a global model that gets updated one hospital at a time through weighted aggregation (F_weight function). The approach combines transfer learning benefits with federated privacy guarantees, reducing communication overhead while maintaining diagnostic accuracy across heterogeneous data distributions.

## Key Results
- FTL achieved 0.8730 overall accuracy, outperforming FL (0.8000) and CFL (0.8476)
- Superior precision, recall, and F1-score for Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma classifications
- Sequential hospital cycling aggregation reduces communication overhead while maintaining model quality
- Digital Twin integration enables real-time model updates and inference optimization without central data storage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained DenseNet-121 initialization accelerates convergence and improves accuracy in heterogeneous CT scan classification.
- Mechanism: Transfer learning from CheXpert-pretrained weights provides domain-relevant feature extractors (edge detection, texture patterns, anatomical structures) that require less fine-tuning than random initialization. Local fine-tuning adapts these features to hospital-specific CT distributions.
- Core assumption: Features learned from CheXpert chest X-rays transfer meaningfully to chest CT scan cancer classification despite modality differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data heterogeneity."
  - [section 4.2] "We have used the DenseNet-121 model because it is pre-trained on the medical dataset CheXpert."
  - [corpus] Related FTL work (FTA-FTL arXiv:2501.03349) shows fine-tuned aggregation improves microscopic image classification, suggesting transfer benefits generalize across medical imaging domains.
- Break condition: If source domain (X-ray) and target domain (CT) feature distributions diverge significantly, transfer may provide negative transfer, degrading performance below random initialization baseline.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequential hospital cycling aggregation reduces communication overhead while maintaining model quality across non-IID data distributions.
- Mechanism: Algorithm 1's weighted cycling approach updates the global model one hospital at a time (W_global+ = FINE-TUNE(W_global-, D_i)), rather than parallel aggregation. This allows each update to incorporate previous hospitals' learned patterns, creating curriculum-like knowledge accumulation.
- Core assumption: Sequential updates preserve more knowledge than parallel FedAvg when data heterogeneity is high, as each hospital builds on previous learning rather than averaging conflicting gradients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "After the update, the selected hospital is removed from the list of participating hospitals since every hospital should participate in the training process."
  - [section 4.4] "FTL exhibits the highest accuracy and F1-score for Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, suggesting that transfer learning enhances the model's ability to generalize from pre-trained knowledge."
  - [corpus] FedEM (arXiv:2503.06021) notes gradient-sharing exposes privacy risks in parallel FL, suggesting sequential approaches may offer different privacy-utility tradeoffs.
- Break condition: If sequential ordering introduces systematic bias (e.g., early hospitals dominate learned representations), later hospitals may see degraded local performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Digital Twin integration enables real-time model updates and inference optimization without storing patient data centrally.
- Mechanism: Each hospital's CT scanner has a virtual DT replica that receives global model parameters, performs local inference, and updates based on new scans. The DT maintains operational state (scanner calibration, patient context) separately from training data, enabling rapid inference while the FTL pipeline handles periodic model improvement.
- Core assumption: DT-based inference introduces acceptable latency for clinical workflows while periodic FTL updates (not real-time) maintain model freshness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "A virtual digital twin monitors the progression of the disease by assigning each patient's CT scan to this model."
  - [section 5] "This research used real-time simulation by updating the digital model with current data at regular intervals from the CT scanners."
  - [corpus] Limited direct validation: Corpus neighbors focus on FL privacy (FedRP, FedEM) without specific DT-integration evidence for medical imaging.
- Break condition: If model update frequency lags behind clinical decision requirements, or if DT state synchronization fails during network partitions, diagnostic accuracy may degrade below acceptable thresholds.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**
  - Why needed here: Core aggregation algorithm referenced in Section 3.1. Without understanding how local gradients combine into global updates, you cannot debug convergence failures or interpret the weighted cycling modification.
  - Quick check question: Given 4 hospitals with 120, 51, 54, and 90 images respectively, how would FedAvg weight each hospital's contribution compared to uniform averaging?

- Concept: **Domain Shift / Non-IID Data**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly claims FTL addresses non-IID challenges (Section 4.4 notes "performance varies for Large Cell Carcinoma and Normal classes, where the precision and recall are relatively lower... attributed to smaller sample size").
  - Quick check question: If Hospital A has 80% Adenocarcinoma cases and Hospital B has 80% Squamous Cell Carcinoma, what failure mode would standard FedAvg encounter that FTL aims to prevent?

- Concept: **DenseNet Architecture (Dense Connections)**
  - Why needed here: Section 4.2 specifies DenseNet-121 as the backbone. Understanding feature propagation through dense blocks helps explain why transfer learning succeeds (or fails) for CT features.
  - Quick check question: How do dense connections differ from ResNet skip connections, and why might this matter for gradient flow during federated fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Central Cloud Server → Hospital Server i → Digital Twin i → CT Scanner i

- **Central Server**: Maintains W_global, runs Algorithm 1, no patient data
- **Hospital Server**: Intermediary relay, does NOT train model directly
- **Digital Twin**: Performs local training on D_i, handles real-time inference
- **CT Scanner**: Physical device generating raw images (never transmitted)

- Critical path:
  1. Central server initializes W_global from CheXpert-pretrained DenseNet-121
  2. For each hospital i in cycling order: W_global → Hospital Server → DT → fine-tune on D_i → W_global+ → Hospital Server → Central Server
  3. Central server applies F_weight (weighting function not fully specified in paper)
  4. Repeat until convergence (threshold: accuracy improvement < ε, loss change < δ for consecutive rounds)
  5. Deployed model runs inference locally on DT, periodic retraining via FTL

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **Sequential vs. parallel aggregation**: Reduces communication rounds but increases wall-clock time (each hospital waits for predecessor)
  - **CheXpert pretraining vs. medical imaging from scratch**: Faster convergence but potential negative transfer if modality gap is large
  - **DT statefulness vs. stateless inference**: Enables real-time monitoring but adds synchronization complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - **Convergence stall**: Loss plateaus early (likely transfer learning features insufficient for target domain)
  - **Class imbalance collapse**: Large Cell Carcinoma recall drops (observed in Table 2: FL 0.6471, CFL 0.7647, FTL 0.8235—improving but still lowest)
  - **Communication timeout**: Hospital DT doesn't respond within round deadline (network partition or compute bottleneck)
  - **Privacy leakage via gradients**: Not addressed in paper—assumption that gradient-only sharing is sufficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline reproduction**: Train DenseNet-121 from scratch (random initialization) using same FTL cycling protocol on the 4-class CT dataset. Compare convergence time and final accuracy to pretrained baseline to isolate transfer learning contribution.
  2. **Ablation on cycling order**: Run FTL with hospitals ordered by dataset size (largest first vs. smallest first vs. random). Measure per-class accuracy to detect ordering bias.
  3. **Non-IID stress test**: Artificially create extreme label imbalance (e.g., Hospital A: 100% Adenocarcinoma, Hospital B: 100% Squamous Cell) and compare FTL vs. standard FedAvg vs. CFL on convergence stability and per-hospital local accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How does the FTL framework perform when deployed in live clinical settings compared to the simulated experimental environment?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The conclusion states, "Future work should include... checking its effectiveness in clinical settings to confirm its efficacy and robustness."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study relies on a retrospective Kaggle dataset partitioned to simulate federated clients, lacking the variability and noise of live hospital infrastructure.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Validation results from a prospective study involving actual hospital servers, diverse scanner hardware, and real-time data ingestion.

- **Question:** To what extent do network latency and communication overhead degrade the real-time analysis capabilities of the Digital Twin integration?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 4.2 states, "we are also not considering any latency issues caused during communication between the cloud and hospital server."
- **Why unresolved:** The authors explicitly excluded network latency from the simulation, yet claim real-time capabilities for the Digital Twin component.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarks of model convergence and inference latency under varying network conditions (bandwidth limits, jitter, packet loss).

- **Question:** Can the framework maintain high diagnostic accuracy for underrepresented classes, such as Large Cell Carcinoma, without specialized augmentation?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The results (Table 2) show lower precision and recall for classes with fewer samples (e.g., Large Cell Carcinoma), which the authors attribute to sample size.
- **Why unresolved:** It is unclear if the FTL aggregation method sufficiently handles severe class imbalance inherent in medical datasets without specific weighting strategies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance metrics (F1-score) on minority classes after implementing class-aware loss functions or generative data augmentation.

## Limitations

- Data partitioning strategy across hospitals remains unspecified (how non-IID splits are constructed)
- F_weight aggregation function implementation not detailed in Algorithm 1
- Digital Twin integration mechanics remain conceptual rather than validated
- Critical hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, local epochs, convergence thresholds) not reported
- CFL clustering methodology lacks technical specification

## Confidence

- **High**: Sequential hospital cycling improves over parallel FedAvg for heterogeneous data (supported by 0.8730 vs 0.8000 accuracy)
- **Medium**: Transfer learning from CheXpert benefits CT classification (pre-trained initialization speeds convergence but modality gap risks unmeasured)
- **Low**: Digital Twin integration meaningfully contributes to real-time inference and privacy (lacks empirical validation beyond conceptual framework)

## Next Checks

1. **Convergence gap analysis**: Compare FTL convergence curves against FL/CFL baselines on identical hardware/software configurations to quantify time-efficiency claims
2. **Transfer learning ablation**: Train identical model from scratch (random initialization) using same FTL cycling protocol to isolate pretraining benefits from architectural choices
3. **DT synchronization stress test**: Simulate network partitions and compute delays in the Digital Twin-server pipeline to measure impact on model update frequency and inference accuracy
