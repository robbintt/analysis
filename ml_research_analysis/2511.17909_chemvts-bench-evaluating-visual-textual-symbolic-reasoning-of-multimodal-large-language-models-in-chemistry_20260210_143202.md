core_contribution: 'ChemVTS-Bench addresses the challenge of evaluating multimodal
  large language models in chemistry, where reasoning integrates visual, textual,
  and symbolic representations. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on simple image-text
  pairs, ChemVTS-Bench provides domain-authentic chemical problems involving organic
  molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, each presented in three
  input modes: visual-only, visual-text hybrid, and SMILES-based symbolic.'

# ChemVTS-Bench: Evaluating Visual-Textual-Symbolic Reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.17909
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909
- Reference count: 39
- Benchmark addresses multimodal reasoning in chemistry with visual, textual, and symbolic inputs

## Executive Summary
ChemVTS-Bench introduces a novel evaluation framework for assessing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in chemistry, where reasoning requires integration of visual diagrams, textual descriptions, and symbolic representations like SMILES. The benchmark covers three chemical domains - organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures - with problems presented in three input modes to enable fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning capabilities. An automated agent-based workflow standardizes evaluation, verifies answers, and diagnoses error types, revealing that while multimodal fusion improves performance, substantial gaps remain in models' ability to integrate chemical information across modalities.

## Method Summary
The benchmark employs an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes evaluation across six state-of-the-art MLLMs. Each chemical problem is presented in three modes: visual-only (images/diagrams), visual-text hybrid (combining diagrams with textual descriptions), and SMILES-based symbolic (chemical notation strings). The workflow verifies answers automatically and categorizes errors to diagnose modality-specific weaknesses. The benchmark focuses on three chemical domains - organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures - to provide domain-authentic reasoning challenges that go beyond simple image-text pairs found in existing multimodal benchmarks.

## Key Results
- Visual-only inputs remain difficult for MLLMs, with performance significantly lower than multimodal conditions
- Structural chemistry problems show the highest error rates across all modalities and domains
- Multimodal fusion reduces errors compared to single-modality inputs but does not eliminate reasoning failures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically isolating and combining visual, textual, and symbolic chemical representations to probe MLLMs' integration capabilities. By presenting the same chemical problem in three different input modes, the evaluation reveals which modalities models can process independently and where cross-modal reasoning breaks down. The automated workflow ensures consistent evaluation standards and enables detailed error diagnosis, moving beyond simple accuracy metrics to understand the nature of reasoning failures in chemical problem-solving.

## Foundational Learning
- Chemical domain knowledge (organic, inorganic, crystal structures): Understanding chemical representations is essential for interpreting benchmark problems and evaluating model reasoning
- Multimodal integration concepts: Critical for grasping how models combine different input types and where failures occur
- SMILES notation system: Required for interpreting symbolic chemical representations used in benchmark problems
- Automated evaluation workflows: Understanding the verification and error diagnosis processes is key to interpreting benchmark results

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Chemical problems -> Three input modes (visual, visual-text, symbolic) -> MLLM processing -> Automated answer verification -> Error categorization
- Critical path: Problem formulation → Input mode selection → MLLM reasoning → Answer generation → Automated verification → Error analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Single-modality evaluation enables isolation of modality-specific capabilities vs. multimodal integration reflects real-world usage; automated verification ensures consistency but may miss nuanced reasoning quality
- Failure signatures: Visual-only inputs show poor performance; structural chemistry consistently yields highest error rates; multimodal fusion improves but doesn't eliminate errors
- First experiments: (1) Test each input mode independently to establish baseline performance; (2) Compare multimodal vs. single-modality performance across all domains; (3) Analyze error patterns by domain and input type to identify systematic weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize beyond tested MLLM set and specific problem types
- Benchmark covers only three chemical domains, potentially missing diverse reasoning tasks
- SMILES representations assume canonical forms, but multiple valid strings exist for same molecules

## Confidence
- High: Multimodal integration improves but doesn't eliminate errors
- Medium: Structural chemistry is hardest domain (depends on problem distribution)
- High: Visual-only inputs remain difficult (consistent across tested models)

## Next Checks
1. Test additional MLLMs with different architectural approaches to multimodal integration
2. Expand benchmark to include spectroscopy interpretation and reaction mechanism analysis
3. Conduct ablation studies by systematically removing input components to measure modality contributions
