# A Universal Banach--Bregman Framework for Stochastic Iterations: Unifying Stochastic Mirror Descent, Learning and LLM Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14216
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14216
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Unifies stochastic mirror descent, learning algorithms, and LLM training under a universal Banach-Bregman geometry framework with provable convergence and up to 20% faster convergence.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a universal Banach-Bregman framework for stochastic iterations that unifies stochastic mirror descent, learning algorithms, and large language model (LLM) training. By replacing Hilbert-space inner products with general Banach-Bregman geometry, the framework extends convergence theory to non-Euclidean settings like mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, and KL-regularized LLM training. The framework introduces Bregman-Fejér monotonicity as a unifying principle and rigorously justifies super-relaxations (λ>2) for the first time in non-Hilbert spaces. Empirical results show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines across machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM domains.

## Method Summary
The framework presents a general stochastic iteration template that performs updates in the dual space mapped by ∇φ, where φ is a Legendre function defining the geometry. Updates follow the form ∇φ(G_{n+1}) = ∇φ(G_n) - λ_n U_n u_n^* where λ_n is a relaxation parameter and u_n^* is a stochastic oracle output. The framework unifies various algorithms by choosing different potentials: squared ℓ₂ norm for Euclidean geometry, entropy for simplex/KL geometry, and relative smoothness for adaptive methods like RMSProp and Adam. Convergence is guaranteed through Bregman-Fejér monotonicity, ensuring iterates don't drift away from the solution set in expectation. The framework also rigorously justifies super-relaxation parameters (λ>2) when they're statistically independent of stochastic gradients.

## Key Results
- Unifies stochastic mirror descent, learning algorithms, and LLM training under a single Banach-Bregman framework
- Achieves up to 20% faster convergence and reduced variance compared to classical baselines
- Demonstrates empirical validation across machine learning (UCI), deep learning (transformers), reinforcement learning (actor-critic), and LLMs (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2)
- Rigorously justifies super-relaxations (λ>2) for the first time in non-Hilbert settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework guarantees convergence of iterates by ensuring Bregman distances to the solution set are non-increasing on average (Bregman–Fejér monotonicity).
- Mechanism: The algorithm performs updates in the dual space mapped by ∇φ. Theorem 3.1 establishes a supermartingale inequality: E[D_φ(z, G_{n+1}) | X_n] ≤ D_φ(z, G_n) - E[descent term] + Y_n. This guarantees that iterates do not drift away from the fixed-point set Z in expectation.
- Core assumption: φ is a Legendre function (essentially smooth and strictly convex) and the tolerance/noise terms Y_n are almost surely summable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation... providing a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman–Fejér monotonicity"
  - [Theorem 3.1] "Bregman–Fejér inequality... E[D_φ(z, G_{n+1})| X_n] ≤ D_φ(z, G_n) ..."
  - [corpus] Neighbor "Policy Mirror Descent" research similarly relies on distance measures to guarantee stable policy updates.
- Break condition: Convergence fails if the cumulative noise ΣY_n diverges or if the potential φ is not strictly convex (violating the Legendre property required for the three-point identity).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Super-relaxation parameters (λ > 2) can be used to accelerate convergence without divergence, provided the relaxation is statistically independent of the stochastic gradient.
- Mechanism: Typically, updates require λ ∈ (0, 2). The paper shows that if λ_n is independent of the filtration generated by the gradients, the expectation term factorizes (Lemma 3.1). This allows convergence as long as E[λ_n(2-λ_n)] ≥ 0 (Proposition 3.1), effectively allowing local λ > 2 values that "average out" to a stable descent.
- Core assumption: Independence of the relaxation parameter λ_n from the stochastic oracle history.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "rigorously justifying super-relaxations (λ>2) for the first time in non-Hilbert settings"
  - [Lemma 3.1] "Factorization by independence... E[λ_n(2-λ_n)Θ_n | X_n] = E[λ_n(2-λ_n)] · E[Θ_n | X_n]"
- Break condition: If λ_n is correlated with the gradient noise (e.g., an adaptive momentum term dependent on current gradient magnitude), the independence factorization fails, potentially causing instability for λ > 2.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Algorithms like Natural Gradient Descent and RMSProp are structurally equivalent to Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD) with specific Bregman geometries.
- Mechanism: By choosing a specific potential φ (e.g., entropy for KL-divergence), the mirror map ∇φ transforms the geometry. Proposition B.2 and Theorem 4.3 demonstrate that adaptive methods are implicit Bregman iterations where the adaptive step size accounts for the curvature of φ.
- Core assumption: The objective function is relatively smooth with respect to the chosen potential φ.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Theorem 4.3] "RMSProp as Bregman iteration"
  - [Proposition B.10] "KL Potential and LLM Log-Likelihood... updates are special cases of Algorithm 1"
  - [corpus] Neighbor "Mirror Descent Under Generalized Smoothness" supports the importance of matching geometry to smoothness assumptions.
- Break condition: If the problem geometry is mismatched (e.g., using a Euclidean potential for a probability simplex constraint without proper projection), the "natural" acceleration is lost, and the method reverts to standard SGD behavior or instability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Legendre Function (φ)**
  - Why needed here: It serves as the "potential" defining the geometry. It must be strictly convex and differentiable to ensure the duality map ∇φ is invertible, mapping primal updates to dual updates and back.
  - Quick check question: Does the function f(x) = x² satisfy the Legendre properties on ℝ? (Yes. What about f(x) = 1/x on (0, ∞)?)

- **Bregman Divergence (D_φ)**
  - Why needed here: It replaces Euclidean distance. It measures the "gap" between a convex function and its linear approximation, acting as the Lyapunov function for convergence proofs.
  - Quick check question: For φ(x) = Σx_i log x_i, what does D_φ(p, q) represent? (KL-Divergence).

- **Robbins–Siegmund Theorem**
  - Why needed here: This is the core probabilistic machinery (Theorem A.1). It proves that a stochastic sequence bounded by a recursive inequality converges almost surely, provided perturbation terms are summable.
  - Quick check question: If E[X_{n+1} | F_n] ≤ X_n + b_n, what condition on b_n ensures X_n converges? (Σb_n < ∞).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Potential (φ) -> Mirror Map (∇φ) -> Stochastic Oracle (u_n^*) -> Relaxation (λ_n)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Initialize: Select G_0 in the interior of φ's domain.
  2. Dual Step: Compute ∇φ(G_n) - λ_n U_n u_n^* in the dual space.
  3. Primal Map: Invert via G_{n+1} = (∇φ)^{-1}(...) to return to the original space.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Geometry Choice: Entropic potential handles probability constraints naturally (good for LLMs) but involves expensive exp/log operations. Euclidean is cheap but requires explicit projection for constraints.
  - Relaxation: High λ (> 1) accelerates early training but risks divergence if independence assumptions fail or if E[λ(2-λ)] < 0.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Domain Error: Iterates leaving int dom φ (e.g., probabilities ≤ 0). Fix: Use safer potentials or step-size damping.
  - Variance Explosion: Large gradients coupled with λ > 2 causing numerical blow-up. Fix: Ensure λ is decorrelated from gradients or use gradient clipping.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify Fejér Monotonicity: Run SMD on a simple logistic regression task; plot D_φ(z*, G_n) vs. iterations to confirm the descent trend predicted by Theorem 3.1.
  2. Super-relaxation Sweep: On WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2, sweep λ ∈ {1.0, 1.3, 1.6, 1.8} to replicate the "20% faster convergence" and variance reduction claims in Section 6.2.
  3. Geometry Ablation: Compare standard SGD (Euclidean) vs. SMD (Entropic) on a constrained RL task (e.g., Actor-Critic) to validate the geometric unification claims.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the Banach-Bregman framework be extended to Finsler geometries to theoretically capture adaptive methods like Adam and AdamW via variable-metric approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Outlook" section lists "Finsler extensions to capture adaptive methods like Adam and AdamW via flexible variable-metric geometries" as an immediate extension.
- Why unresolved: The current theory is confined to Banach spaces; Adam's sign-based updates require the more general, non-symmetric Finsler metric structure.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical derivation of the Bregman–Fejér monotonicity principle for Finsler manifolds and empirical convergence proofs for Adam/AdamW.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can this framework be generalized to Wasserstein spaces to handle distributionally robust learning and KL-regularized RLHF?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The "Outlook" section identifies "Wasserstein extensions for robust learning... in distributionally robust settings" as a specific future direction.
- Why unresolved: The current iteration analysis operates within L² Banach spaces, whereas RLHF often requires optimization over the space of probability measures (Wasserstein space).
- What evidence would resolve it: Convergence theorems for stochastic iterations derived directly on the Wasserstein manifold with applications to robust policy optimization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do the observed convergence accelerations and reduced variance persist when scaling from distilGPT-2 to billion-parameter Large Language Models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims to unify "LLM training" and demonstrate empirical success, but Section 6.2 validates this only on "Tiny-scale LLMs" (distilgpt2).
- Why unresolved: The optimization landscape, gradient noise, and compute constraints of 7B+ parameter models differ significantly from the tiny-scale benchmarks used.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarks demonstrating the framework's stability and speedups on standard large-scale LLM pre-training or fine-tuning tasks (e.g., LLaMA-scale).

## Limitations

- The framework's convergence guarantees depend on strong independence assumptions for super-relaxation parameters that may not hold in practical adaptive methods
- Theoretical results primarily apply to compact constraint sets, with incomplete treatment of unbounded domains
- Empirical validation is limited to relatively simple models (distilGPT-2) rather than state-of-the-art architectures
- The extension to unbounded domains and large-scale models remains incompletely addressed

## Confidence

- **Bregman-Fejér monotonicity convergence theorem (Theorem 3.1)**: High confidence - follows standard supermartingale arguments with well-established proof techniques
- **Super-relaxation acceleration without divergence**: Medium confidence - theoretically justified under independence assumptions, but practical implementations often violate these assumptions
- **Equivalence of adaptive methods to SMD**: Medium confidence - structural equivalences are proven, but practical implications for optimization performance remain partially demonstrated
- **20% faster convergence in LLM experiments**: Medium confidence - empirical results show improvement, but comparisons are primarily against SGD rather than more competitive baselines

## Next Checks

1. **Validate independence assumption**: Implement a version tracking gradient-gradient correlations in super-relaxed updates. Measure how often the independence condition is violated in practical settings and quantify the impact on stability.

2. **Stress test unbounded domains**: Apply the framework to logistic regression on datasets with outliers or to unbounded RL action spaces. Monitor whether the iterates remain in the domain of the potential and whether convergence rates degrade.

3. **Benchmark against modern optimizers**: Extend experiments to compare against AdamW, Lion, and other state-of-the-art optimizers on transformer architectures. Test whether Bregman geometry provides advantages beyond what adaptive methods already deliver.
