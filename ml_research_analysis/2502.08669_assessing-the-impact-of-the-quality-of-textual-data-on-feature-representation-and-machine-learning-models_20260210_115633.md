# Assessing the Impact of the Quality of Textual Data on Feature Representation and Machine Learning Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.08669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08669
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Datasets with error rates below 10% maintain acceptable model performance; higher error rates necessitate corrective measures

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates how textual data quality affects feature representation and machine learning model performance in healthcare settings. The research introduces a rudimentary error rate metric to quantify spelling and whitespace errors at the token level, using Mixtral LLM to both introduce errors into clean data and correct errors in lower-quality datasets. The study focuses on mortality prediction using MIMIC-III data and various clinical tasks in aged care homes data, finding that TF-IDF features generally outperform embedding-based methods. A critical finding is that model performance remains stable with error rates below 10% but degrades significantly at higher rates, establishing a practical threshold for acceptable data quality in healthcare applications.

## Method Summary
The research developed a systematic approach to assess textual data quality by creating a token-level error rate metric focused on spelling and whitespace errors. Using Mixtral LLM, researchers artificially introduced controlled error rates into the high-quality MIMIC-III dataset and corrected errors in the lower-quality aged care homes dataset. The methodology compared TF-IDF features against embedding-based representations across multiple machine learning models for different clinical tasks. Error rates were varied systematically to understand the relationship between data quality degradation and model performance, with ROC-AUC metrics used as the primary evaluation measure. The approach allowed for controlled experimentation on the impact of data quality on model effectiveness.

## Key Results
- ROC-AUC performance remained stable with error rates below 10% but declined significantly at higher rates
- Datasets with average error rates around 8% showed no substantial impact on model performance
- TF-IDF features consistently outperformed embedding-based methods across both datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The stability of model performance below 10% error rate may be attributed to the robustness of modern ML algorithms in handling minor noise in feature representations. TF-IDF's superior performance with noisy data likely stems from its frequency-based weighting scheme, which can better handle spelling variations compared to continuous embedding representations that require precise token matching. The threshold effect suggests there may be a critical point where accumulated errors begin to significantly distort semantic relationships between tokens, overwhelming the model's ability to extract meaningful patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- Token-level error rate metric: Why needed - provides quantifiable measure of textual data quality degradation
  Quick check - count spelling and whitespace errors per token
- Mixtral LLM error generation/correction: Why needed - enables controlled experimentation with data quality
  Quick check - verify error types and correction accuracy
- TF-IDF vs embedding comparison: Why needed - determines optimal feature representation for noisy data
  Quick check - benchmark both methods across error rate ranges
- 10% error rate threshold: Why needed - establishes practical limit for acceptable data quality
  Quick check - validate across multiple healthcare datasets
- ROC-AUC evaluation: Why needed - standard metric for binary classification in healthcare
  Quick check - ensure consistent threshold selection across experiments

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: MIMIC-III/aged care data -> Error injection/correction -> Feature extraction (TF-IDF/embeddings) -> ML models -> Performance evaluation

Critical path: Data quality assessment -> Error manipulation -> Feature representation -> Model training -> Performance validation

Design tradeoffs: Controlled error introduction vs. natural data variation; TF-IDF simplicity vs. embedding richness; error rate quantification vs. semantic error detection

Failure signatures: Performance degradation above 10% error rate; TF-IDF underperformance vs. embeddings; inconsistent error correction by LLM

First experiments:
1. Validate error rate threshold across multiple healthcare datasets
2. Test error correction accuracy with different LLM models
3. Benchmark feature representations on synthetic datasets with controlled error patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the 10% threshold vary across different clinical domains and tasks?
- What specific types of errors (spelling vs. whitespace) have the most significant impact on model performance?
- Can more sophisticated error correction techniques improve performance beyond the 10% threshold?

## Limitations
- The 10% error rate threshold was derived from a single healthcare dataset and may not generalize
- Focus on spelling and whitespace errors may overlook other important quality issues
- The error generation and correction process using Mixtral LLM may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Limited exploration of semantic errors that could impact clinical meaning despite correct spelling

## Confidence
High Confidence:
- Comparative performance of TF-IDF vs embedding methods
- Decline in performance above 10% error rate in MIMIC-III

Medium Confidence:
- General applicability of 10% threshold across healthcare datasets
- Mixtral LLM effectiveness for error correction

Low Confidence:
- Extrapolation to non-healthcare domains
- Long-term stability of performance improvements

## Next Checks
1. Replicate error threshold analysis using diverse healthcare datasets from multiple institutions
2. Conduct comprehensive error type analysis to identify which specific error types most impact performance
3. Implement longitudinal study to assess stability of model performance improvements over time in real-world deployment
4. Test the threshold with other error types beyond spelling and whitespace errors
5. Validate findings with different ML architectures and hyperparameter configurations
