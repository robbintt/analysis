# Trust-Based Social Learning for Communication (TSLEC) Protocol Evolution in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19562
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19562
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Trust-based social learning accelerates emergent communication by 23.9% with compositional protocols that remain robust under dynamic objectives

## Executive Summary
TSLEC introduces a novel trust-based social learning mechanism for emergent communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. The approach enables agents to explicitly teach successful communication strategies to peers while using learned trust relationships to filter and prioritize knowledge transfer. This framework addresses the challenge of slow convergence in traditional emergent communication approaches by leveraging social learning dynamics. Through extensive experiments across 30 random seeds and 100 episodes, TSLEC demonstrates statistically significant improvements in both convergence speed and protocol quality compared to independent emergence baselines.

## Method Summary
The TSLEC framework implements a three-stage process where agents first learn communication strategies through individual reinforcement learning, then share successful strategies with peers, and finally use trust-weighted aggregation to incorporate received knowledge. Trust relationships are learned through experience, with agents evaluating the quality of received teachings and adjusting trust scores accordingly. The mechanism uses a differentiable trust weighting function that modulates the influence of peer teachings based on historical performance. The protocol evolution process occurs within a population of agents that can both send and receive communication signals, with trust scores updated continuously based on teaching effectiveness.

## Key Results
- 23.9% reduction in episodes-to-convergence compared to independent emergence (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.98)
- Compositional protocols with C = 0.38 quality metric indicating meaningful structure
- Robust decoding accuracy (Φ > 0.867) maintained under dynamic objectives
- Strong correlation between trust scores and teaching quality (r = 0.743, p < 0.001)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by combining explicit knowledge sharing with trust-based filtering, allowing high-quality teachings to propagate more effectively through the agent population. Trust scores create a dynamic selection pressure that amplifies successful strategies while damping ineffective ones. The social learning component accelerates convergence by leveraging successful experiences across multiple agents rather than relying solely on individual exploration. This creates a positive feedback loop where successful teachers gain influence, leading to faster adoption of effective communication protocols.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Emergent Communication in MARL**: Agents must learn to communicate without pre-defined protocols, requiring mechanisms for protocol evolution and standardization. Needed to establish baseline problem and TSLEC's solution space. Quick check: Compare convergence curves between TSLEC and vanilla emergent communication approaches.

2. **Social Learning Dynamics**: Agents can accelerate learning by sharing successful strategies, but require mechanisms to evaluate teaching quality. Needed to justify trust-based filtering approach. Quick check: Measure knowledge transfer effectiveness with and without trust weighting.

3. **Trust-Based Knowledge Filtering**: Trust scores modulate information flow between agents, preventing low-quality teachings from dominating. Needed to explain TSLEC's improved performance over simple knowledge sharing. Quick check: Analyze protocol evolution trajectories with different trust update mechanisms.

4. **Compositional Protocol Emergence**: Protocols should exhibit systematic structure that generalizes to novel situations. Needed to evaluate TSLEC's contribution beyond speed improvements. Quick check: Test protocol generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Agent RL Learner -> Trust Module -> Social Teaching Module -> Protocol Aggregator -> Agent RL Learner

Critical Path: Each agent independently learns communication → Successful strategies are shared with trusted peers → Trust-weighted aggregation updates individual policies → Convergence accelerates through social learning

Design Tradeoffs: Explicit teaching vs. pure exploration balance, trust computation overhead vs. convergence benefits, knowledge sharing frequency vs. protocol stability

Failure Signatures: Slow convergence indicates poor trust formation or teaching quality issues, protocol fragmentation suggests trust weighting problems, communication inefficiency may indicate RL component issues

First Experiments:
1. Single-agent vs. multi-agent comparison with identical objectives
2. Trust score evolution tracking during learning process
3. Protocol compositionality analysis under varying population sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effect size (Cohen's d = 1.98) suggests practical impact may vary across different problem domains
- Compositional quality metric (C = 0.38) sensitivity to evaluation methods remains unclear
- Performance in highly volatile or adversarial environments not extensively tested

## Confidence

High Confidence: Statistical significance of convergence improvements, trust-quality correlation

Medium Confidence: Protocol compositional quality metrics, decoding accuracy robustness

Low Confidence: Generalization to highly dynamic environments, scalability to larger agent populations

## Next Checks

1. Test TSLEC in environments with rapid, non-stationary objective shifts to evaluate trust mechanism adaptability under extreme dynamics

2. Scale experiments to 50+ agents to assess trust network scalability and computational efficiency constraints

3. Compare TSLEC against alternative social learning mechanisms (peer-review, imitation learning) in identical environments to isolate trust mechanism contributions
