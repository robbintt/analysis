# SWITCH: Benchmarking Modeling and Handling of Tangible Interfaces in Long-horizon Embodied Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.17649
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17649
- **Reference count:** 36
- **Key outcome:** Introduces SWITCH benchmark to evaluate LMMs on tangible control interface (TCI) tasks like light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, revealing systematic failures in integrating visual and textual evidence.

## Executive Summary
SWITCH is a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal models on tangible control interface (TCI) tasks, addressing a gap in current benchmarks that focus on object interactions or abstract digital actions. The benchmark includes five complementary tasks: task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state transition prediction, and result verification, using 351 tasks across 98 real devices. Commercial and open LMMs show inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues while under-utilizing visual or video evidence. The benchmark provides reproducible data, code, and held-out splits to support evaluation and future community contributions.

## Method Summary
SWITCH evaluates LMMs on five TCI-centric tasks using a zero-shot protocol with MCQ format and varying modality combinations (image/video in question, text/image/video in answer choices). The benchmark uses 193 egocentric RGB video samples and 351 tasks across 98 real devices spanning four categories. Tested models include Claude Sonnet 4 (image+text only), Gemini 2.5 Flash (full multimodal), and Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct (full multimodal). Each model receives multimodal context plus MCQ options and selects one answer. The benchmark provides evaluation scripts and requires API access or local inference for target models.

## Key Results
- Commercial and open LMMs show inconsistent performance on single-step TCI interactions, with aggregate accuracy masking modality-specific weaknesses.
- Models over-rely on textual cues and under-utilize visual or video evidence, particularly evident in image-image and video-video question formats.
- Fine-grained visual perception errors significantly impact action generation tasks, with accuracy dropping when visual context is added due to abstraction burden.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive coverage of tangible interface interactions through five complementary tasks that test different aspects of multimodal reasoning. By using real devices and egocentric video data, SWITCH creates ecologically valid scenarios that require models to integrate visual perception, causal reasoning, and state tracking. The MCQ format with varying modality combinations allows systematic evaluation of how models handle different evidence types, revealing specific failure modes in visual reasoning and evidence integration.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tangible Control Interfaces (TCI):** Physical devices like switches, panels, and embedded GUIs that require direct interaction. Why needed: Benchmark focuses specifically on these real-world control scenarios. Quick check: Identify examples of TCI in everyday environments.
- **Multimodal Reasoning:** Integration of visual, textual, and temporal information for decision-making. Why needed: Models must process video, images, and text to solve TCI tasks. Quick check: Verify model can answer questions requiring cross-modal evidence.
- **State Transition Prediction:** Inferring device state changes from interaction sequences. Why needed: Core to understanding cause-effect relationships in tangible interfaces. Quick check: Test model on before-after state comparison questions.
- **Egocentric Video Understanding:** Interpreting first-person perspective video data. Why needed: Benchmark uses egocentric viewpoints for ecological validity. Quick check: Confirm model can extract relevant actions from egocentric sequences.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Collection -> Annotation Pipeline -> Task Generation -> Evaluation Framework -> Model Testing

**Critical Path:** Real device videos → Fine-grained action/state annotations → MCQ question generation → Zero-shot model evaluation → Accuracy computation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The benchmark prioritizes ecological validity (real devices, egocentric video) over scalability (193 videos, manual annotations), trading breadth for depth in evaluating real-world interaction scenarios.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Over-reliance on textual answer choices over visual evidence
- Performance degradation with video input due to abstraction burden
- Device-specific learning failures that don't generalize to new interfaces

**First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline accuracy on text-only questions (IT format) across all five tasks
2. Compare performance on image-option vs text-option questions for same tasks
3. Evaluate model accuracy on held-out device categories to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can multimodal architectures be modified to better handle the "abstraction burden" of raw visual data in TCI tasks, preventing performance degradation when models switch from text-only to image/video inputs? The paper demonstrates current models struggle to ground reasoning in visual evidence without textual shortcuts.

### Open Question 2
What mechanisms are required for autonomous agents to detect and recover from execution errors in multi-step TCI interactions? The benchmark currently covers only 5 instances of canceling or restarting interactions.

### Open Question 3
Can models learn to infer the state of tangible interfaces solely from indirect environmental cues when the interface itself is partially occluded? This "context-aware inference" capability is proposed for future extensions but untested in current benchmark.

## Limitations
- Zero-shot evaluation without fine-tuning may underrepresent practical deployment capabilities
- 98 real devices introduce device-specific bias that may not generalize to broader TCI categories
- MCQ format may not fully capture sequential decision-making and error recovery processes in real-world interactions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The benchmark successfully identifies systematic failures in LMMs' ability to integrate visual and textual evidence for tangible control tasks. The finding that aggregate accuracy masks modality-specific weaknesses is well-supported.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about commercial models' poor visual reasoning capabilities are supported but could be strengthened by testing additional model families and varying prompt engineering approaches.

**Medium Confidence:** The assertion that fine-grained visual perception is a bottleneck for Action Generation tasks is plausible but requires additional ablation studies isolating visual vs textual components.

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Engineering Validation:** Test whether systematic prompt optimization improves performance on visual-option questions without degrading text-option performance.
2. **Generalization Study:** Evaluate model performance on held-out device categories not present in the training split to assess whether failures stem from device-specific learning or fundamental reasoning limitations.
3. **Error Analysis Framework:** Implement detailed error categorization to quantify which failure modes contribute most to accuracy gaps across different task types.
