# Structured AI Decision-Making in Disaster Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.01576
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01576
- Authors: Julian Gerald Dcruz; Argyrios Zolotas; Niall Ross Greenwood; Miguel Arana-Catania
- Reference count: 40
- The framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions and 38.93% higher accuracy than human operators across multiple scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a structured decision-making framework for AI systems in disaster management that uses Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios to enhance traceability and reliability. The framework addresses the critical need for accountable AI decision-making in safety-critical domains where errors can have severe consequences. By implementing a structured approach to decision flows, the system demonstrates significant improvements over both judgement-based systems and human operators in terms of stability and accuracy across multiple disaster scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework introduces a structured decision-making architecture that organizes AI agents into Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios to create a traceable decision flow. The evaluation methodology compared the framework's performance against judgement-based systems and human operators (victims, volunteers, and stakeholders) across multiple disaster scenarios. Performance metrics focused on decision stability and accuracy, with the structured framework showing superior consistency and correctness compared to baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- The structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple scenarios compared to judgement-based systems
- Framework outperforms human operators with 38.93% higher accuracy across various disaster scenarios
- The structured approach demonstrates enhanced traceability and reliability in safety-critical AI decision-making contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by introducing structured decision-making through Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios that create a systematic approach to AI decision flows. This structure enables traceability and consistency in decision-making processes, reducing the variability and potential errors associated with less structured approaches. The hierarchical organization allows for better coordination between different AI components and provides clear accountability paths for each decision made.

## Foundational Learning

**Structured Decision-Making** - Why needed: Ensures consistent, traceable AI decisions in safety-critical contexts; Quick check: Verify decision paths are documented and auditable

**Enabler Agents** - Why needed: Specialized AI components that facilitate specific decision-making capabilities; Quick check: Confirm each agent has clearly defined roles and responsibilities

**Scenario-Based Evaluation** - Why needed: Tests system performance across diverse disaster situations; Quick check: Ensure evaluation scenarios cover multiple disaster types and complexity levels

**Traceability Framework** - Why needed: Provides accountability and auditability for AI decisions; Quick check: Validate that each decision can be traced back through the decision-making hierarchy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Enabler Agents -> Levels -> Scenarios -> Decision Output

**Critical Path**: Input Data -> Enabler Agent Processing -> Level Coordination -> Scenario Integration -> Final Decision

**Design Tradeoffs**: The structured approach sacrifices some flexibility for increased reliability and traceability, prioritizing safety-critical requirements over adaptability in rapidly changing conditions.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent decision-making patterns may indicate Level coordination failures; lack of traceability suggests Enabler agent communication breakdowns; scenario integration errors point to framework configuration issues.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement a simple disaster scenario with one Enabler agent and two Levels to validate basic decision flow
2. Test traceability by logging all decision paths and verifying auditability
3. Compare decision consistency across three different scenarios with identical inputs to measure stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The 60.94% stability improvement is measured against unspecified judgement-based systems, limiting comparison validity
- Human operator comparison uses non-professional stakeholders rather than trained emergency responders, potentially limiting real-world applicability
- Limited technical detail on Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios structure prevents independent replication and validation

## Confidence
High: Framework's relative performance improvements over judgement-based systems
Medium: Human operator comparison due to participant selection concerns
Low: Real-world applicability without additional operational validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework against trained emergency response professionals rather than general stakeholders to establish baseline performance in realistic operational contexts
2. Conduct field validation during actual disaster simulations or controlled emergency exercises to measure real-world effectiveness
3. Implement cross-scenario stress testing with increasingly complex disaster scenarios to evaluate framework robustness beyond the current test set
