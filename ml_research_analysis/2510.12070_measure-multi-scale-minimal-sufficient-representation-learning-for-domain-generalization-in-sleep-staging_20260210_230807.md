# MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.12070
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12070
- Reference count: 40
- Accuracy: 87.3% on SleepEDF-20, 88.3% on MASS

## Executive Summary
MEASURE addresses domain generalization challenges in automatic sleep staging by introducing a novel framework that combines multi-scale feature learning with minimal sufficient representation learning. The approach reduces excess domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features across multiple encoder layers. By leveraging von Mises-Fisher distribution approximation and Stein gradient estimation, MEASURE effectively minimizes conditional entropy H(z|d) without requiring additional adversarial training modules.

## Method Summary
The MEASURE framework integrates multi-scale feature learning with minimal sufficient representation learning to achieve domain generalization in sleep staging. The method employs von Mises-Fisher distribution approximation combined with Stein gradient estimation to minimize conditional entropy H(z|d), effectively reducing domain-specific information while preserving discriminative features. Multi-scale feature extraction is achieved through multiple encoder layers, capturing temporal and spectral characteristics across different scales. The framework was evaluated on SleepEDF-20 and MASS datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved 87.3% accuracy on SleepEDF-20 dataset
- Achieved 88.3% accuracy on MASS dataset
- Cohen's Kappa of 0.826 for both datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by simultaneously learning multi-scale features while minimizing domain-specific information through conditional entropy reduction. The von Mises-Fisher distribution approximation allows for efficient representation of high-dimensional features on a hypersphere, while Stein gradient estimation provides a way to estimate gradients without requiring explicit density models. This combination enables effective domain generalization without the need for adversarial training modules.

## Foundational Learning

**von Mises-Fisher Distribution**: A probability distribution on the unit hypersphere used to model directional data. Why needed: To represent high-dimensional feature vectors in a normalized space for efficient domain generalization. Quick check: Verify the distribution parameters (mean direction and concentration) are correctly estimated from the data.

**Stein Gradient Estimation**: A method for estimating gradients of distributions using Stein's identity without requiring explicit density models. Why needed: To optimize the conditional entropy H(z|d) without computing intractable integrals. Quick check: Validate gradient estimates against finite-difference approximations.

**Multi-scale Feature Learning**: Extracting features at multiple temporal and spectral resolutions. Why needed: To capture diverse characteristics of sleep EEG signals across different scales. Quick check: Confirm that features at different scales are complementary and not redundant.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input EEG -> Multi-scale Encoder Layers -> von Mises-Fisher Approximation -> Stein Gradient Estimation -> Minimal Sufficient Representation -> Classifier

Critical Path: The core pipeline involves multi-scale feature extraction through encoder layers, followed by distribution approximation and entropy minimization, culminating in classification. The conditional entropy minimization via Stein gradients is the critical component enabling domain generalization.

Design Tradeoffs: The multi-scale approach provides comprehensive feature coverage but increases computational complexity. The von Mises-Fisher approximation simplifies representation learning but may not capture all distributional characteristics. The entropy minimization approach avoids adversarial training but requires careful gradient estimation.

Failure Signatures: Poor domain generalization may manifest as overfitting to training domain statistics, degraded performance on out-of-distribution samples, or failure to capture relevant temporal dynamics. Computational bottlenecks may arise from the multi-scale processing pipeline.

First Experiments:
1. Validate multi-scale feature extraction by comparing feature importance across different scales
2. Test von Mises-Fisher approximation quality on synthetic directional data
3. Evaluate conditional entropy reduction on domain-shifted validation sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Potential overfitting to specific EEG signal characteristics in the evaluated datasets
- Computational complexity from multi-scale feature extraction may limit real-time applications
- Evaluation restricted to SleepEDF-20 and MASS datasets without testing on more diverse populations
- No exploration of alternative architectural choices or hyperparameter sensitivities

## Next Checks

1. Test MEASURE on additional sleep staging datasets with varying signal qualities and recording protocols to assess robustness to domain shifts.
2. Conduct ablation studies with alternative distribution approximations and feature extraction methods to isolate the contribution of the von Mises-Fisher component.
3. Evaluate the computational overhead and latency of the multi-scale learning approach in a real-time sleep staging pipeline to assess practical deployment feasibility.
