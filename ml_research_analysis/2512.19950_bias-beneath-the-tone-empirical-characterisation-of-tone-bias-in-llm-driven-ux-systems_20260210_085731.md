# Bias Beneath the Tone: Empirical Characterisation of Tone Bias in LLM-Driven UX Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19950
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19950
- Reference count: 32
- Core finding: LLM-generated dialogues exhibit measurable tonal bias even when neutrality is requested, with ensemble classifiers achieving up to 0.92 macro-F1 in bias detection

## Executive Summary
This study investigates tonal bias in LLM-generated dialogues for conversational AI systems, where models consistently convey subtle emotional tones (e.g., overly polite, cheerful) even when neutral responses are requested. The research introduces a novel methodology combining controllable LLM-based dialogue synthesis with weak supervision using DistilBERT for scalable, ethical emotion recognition. By creating synthetic datasets of neutral and tone-conditioned dialogues, the study trains multiple classifiers to detect these biases, revealing that even "neutral" prompts produce systematically polite or positive framing. This work provides a lightweight, interpretable diagnostic pipeline for auditing and improving tone fairness in conversational AI systems.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines controllable LLM-based dialogue synthesis with weak supervision using a pretrained DistilBERT model to label tones in generated conversations. Two synthetic datasets were created: one with neutral dialogues and another with tone-conditioned dialogues (polite, cheerful). Multiple classifiers were trained on these datasets, including Logistic Regression, SVM, ensemble models, and neural variants like DMN and NSE. The weak supervision approach enables scalable, ethical emotion recognition without requiring extensive human annotation. Ensemble models achieved the highest performance with macro-F1 scores up to 0.92, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for detecting tonal bias in LLM outputs.

## Key Results
- Ensemble classifiers achieved macro-F1 scores up to 0.92 in detecting tonal bias
- Even "neutral" prompts consistently produced polite or positive framing in LLM outputs
- Systematic, measurable tonal bias was detected across multiple LLM-generated dialogue datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The detection pipeline works by first generating synthetic dialogues using LLMs under different tone conditions, then applying weak supervision with DistilBERT to label emotional tones. This labeled data trains multiple classifiers to recognize patterns of tonal bias. The approach is effective because it combines the generative power of LLMs with the classification capabilities of pretrained models, creating a scalable system for bias detection that doesn't require extensive human annotation.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM Dialogue Generation**: Needed to create controlled, synthetic datasets for bias analysis; quick check: verify generation prompts produce consistent tone patterns
- **Weak Supervision with DistilBERT**: Enables scalable labeling without human annotation; quick check: validate DistilBERT's tone classification accuracy on test data
- **Ensemble Classification**: Combines multiple models to improve detection accuracy; quick check: compare ensemble performance against individual models
- **Synthetic Dataset Creation**: Provides ethical, controlled data for bias research; quick check: ensure dataset diversity and representativeness
- **Tone Attribute Definition**: Critical for consistent bias measurement; quick check: validate tone attribute definitions with domain experts
- **Classification Metrics (Macro-F1)**: Measures performance across all tone classes; quick check: ensure balanced evaluation across classes

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: LLM Generation -> Weak Supervision (DistilBERT) -> Classification Training -> Bias Detection
**Critical Path**: Dialogue generation → Tone labeling → Classifier training → Bias measurement
**Design Tradeoffs**: Synthetic data vs. real conversations (ethical concerns vs. authenticity), weak supervision vs. manual annotation (scalability vs. accuracy)
**Failure Signatures**: Poor classifier performance indicates issues with weak supervision quality, insufficient training data, or overly subtle tone differences
**First Experiments**: 1) Test DistilBERT tone labeling accuracy on held-out data, 2) Compare classifier performance across different LLM architectures, 3) Validate synthetic dataset quality with human reviewers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic datasets may not fully capture real-world conversational complexity
- Weak supervision introduces uncertainty in tone labeling accuracy
- Limited set of tonal attributes examined (polite, cheerful) may miss other bias types
- Single LLM (ChatGPT-4) used may introduce model-specific biases

## Confidence
- Measurable tonal bias in LLM outputs: High
- Precise quantification of bias implications for real systems: Medium
- Generalizability across LLM architectures: Medium

## Next Checks
1) Conduct user study with real human-machine interactions to validate synthetic dataset findings
2) Test detection pipeline across multiple LLM architectures to assess generalizability
3) Expand tone attribute set and validate weak supervision labels with human annotators for comprehensive bias coverage
