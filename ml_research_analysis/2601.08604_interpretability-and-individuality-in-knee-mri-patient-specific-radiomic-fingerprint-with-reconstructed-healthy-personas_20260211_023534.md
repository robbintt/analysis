# Interpretability and Individuality in Knee MRI: Patient-Specific Radiomic Fingerprint with Reconstructed Healthy Personas

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08604
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08604
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Patient-specific radiomic fingerprint framework with healthy personas achieves interpretable knee MRI classification performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel radiomic framework that dynamically selects patient-specific radiomic features and synthesizes a healthy anatomical baseline for each individual. The method combines a diffusion model trained exclusively on healthy knees to generate "healthy personas" with a neural network that predicts image-conditioned feature relevance. This enables interpretable biomarker discovery by allowing clinicians to see which features are used for each patient and compare pathological regions to healthy baselines. Experiments on MRNet and ACL tear datasets demonstrate that the approach achieves AUCs up to 0.88 for meniscus tear detection while maintaining feature-level transparency.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates three key components: (1) a DDPM trained only on healthy knee MRIs to synthesize healthy personas via inpainting masked pathological regions, (2) a usage predictor (3D ResNet-18) that learns image-conditioned probabilities over a large radiomic feature pool, and (3) a logistic regression classifier with global coefficients. The model jointly trains usage predictor and classifier using only condition labels, with L1 regularization encouraging sparse per-subject feature selection. Radiomic features (first-order + shape) are extracted from both pathological images and healthy personas across multiple subpatch grids and anatomical views, creating a comprehensive interpretable feature space.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUC up to 0.88 for meniscus tear detection with high sensitivity
- Healthy personas improve sensitivity for ACL tear detection (AUC 0.80 vs 0.68 without persona)
- Ablation studies show clear contributions of persona synthesis and feature selection
- Maintains interpretability through transparent feature selection and visual comparison with healthy personas

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Patient-specific feature weighting via learned usage probabilities improves discriminative power while maintaining interpretability compared to fixed population-level radiomic signatures. A neural network predicts image-conditioned usage probabilities u ∈ [0,1]^N over candidate features, gating each feature's contribution to a logistic regression classifier. This separates population-level effect directions (β) from subject-specific feature relevance (u).

### Mechanism 2
Synthesizing patient-specific healthy baselines via diffusion inpainting provides residual representations that amplify pathological deviations while suppressing anatomical nuisance variation. A DDPM trained on healthy knee MRIs inpaints masked ROIs to reconstruct healthy personas, and residual features capture deviations from normal anatomy.

### Mechanism 3
Joint end-to-end training of usage predictor and logistic classifier with L1/L2 regularization enables coherent feature selection without requiring explicit feature labels. The full objective L = E[L_cross_entropy(c, p(c|α,β))] + λ_u||u||_1 + λ_β||β||_2 is differentiable w.r.t. both predictor and classifier parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Radiomic Feature Extraction**
  - Why needed: Framework relies on handcrafted features as interpretable substrate
  - Quick check: Given an ROI mask, can you explain what First-Order Entropy and 3D Compactness measure, and why they might change with pathology?

- **Concept: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)**
  - Why needed: Healthy persona generated via 3D DDPM; understanding diffusion process explains healthy reconstruction
  - Quick check: In a DDPM with T=1000 timesteps and linear noise schedule γ_t ∈ [10^-4, 2×10^-2], what does the model learn to predict at each step, and how does masking enable conditional inpainting?

- **Concept: Latent-Variable Models with Marginalization**
  - Why needed: Probabilistic interpretation frames feature selection as marginalizing over binary usage indicators
  - Quick check: If z_n ∈ {0,1} is a latent usage indicator with p(z_n=1|I) = u_n, write the marginalized prediction p(c|I) in terms of u_n and β_n. Why is soft selection (using u_n directly) a practical relaxation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Input preprocessing -> DDPM training on healthy volumes -> Healthy persona synthesis via inpainting -> Radiomic feature extraction (pathological + persona) -> Usage predictor (3D ResNet-18) -> Logistic regression classifier -> Joint α-β training

- **Critical path:**
  1. DDPM training must precede main training on healthy subset
  2. Feature extraction pipeline: verify numerical stability and standardize features
  3. Joint α-β training: initialize with pretrained weights, monitor u sparsity
  4. Threshold selection: re-estimate decision threshold every 10 epochs

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Interpretability vs. sensitivity: First-order + shape features are more interpretable but less sensitive than higher-order texture
  - Persona inclusion: Improves sensitivity but can over-amplify subtle variations, reducing specificity
  - Patch granularity: 3×3×3 better for focal pathologies; 2×2×2 better for global abnormalities
  - Registration: Critical for alignment; removing registration drastically reduces ACL sensitivity

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Usage predictor collapse: u ≈ uniform or all near 0/1
  - Persona artifacts: anatomically implausible inpainting
  - Overfitting on small feature pool: with n=1, AUC drops significantly
  - Registration failure causing misalignment: sensitivity plummets

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. DDPM reconstruction validation: train DDPM3D on healthy subset, evaluate SSIM/MSE, compare vs. GAN and ViT3D-AE
  2. Ablation of core components: run 4 conditions (full, no predictor, no persona, no registration) on MRNet validation
  3. Patch granularity sweep: compare 1×1×1, 2×2×2, 3×3×3 configurations on all three tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can adaptive spatial decomposition tailored to individual anatomical presentations improve classification performance over fixed grid sampling? The current study uses fixed regular grids which may not optimally align with variable patient anatomy or pathology locations.

### Open Question 2
Does the reconstructed healthy persona introduce misleading artifacts or reduce diagnostic utility in low-data regimes or for subtle pathologies? Current experiments focus on distinct tears; failure modes in low-resource or subtle clinical settings remain unexplored.

### Open Question 3
Is it possible to utilize higher-order texture features without sacrificing the feature-level transparency required for clinical adoption? The most performant features (texture) are less directly relatable to radiological reasoning compared to the proposed First-Order + Shape baseline.

## Limitations
- Interpretability claims rely on user interpretation without quantitative validation through clinician studies
- Performance gains measured against simple MRNet baseline; comparison with modern foundation models would strengthen claims
- Diffusion model assumes clean separation between anatomy and pathology, which may not hold for early-stage or diffuse disease

## Confidence

- **High**: DDPM3D achieves state-of-the-art SSIM/MSE for healthy MRI reconstruction; ablation studies show clear contributions
- **Medium**: Joint α-β training framework works as described; end-to-end optimization improves AUC over static radiomics
- **Low**: Clinical interpretability claims lack quantitative validation; diffusion model may not generalize to unseen anatomical variations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a clinician study to quantify whether healthy personas and interpretable features actually improve diagnostic understanding vs. black-box models
2. Test diffusion model robustness by introducing pathology simulations into healthy scans and measuring reconstruction fidelity
3. Benchmark against modern self-supervised and multimodal foundation models to establish true performance frontier
