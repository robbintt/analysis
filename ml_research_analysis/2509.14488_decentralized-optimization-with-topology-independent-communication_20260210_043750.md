# Decentralized Optimization with Topology-Independent Communication

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.14488
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14488
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Primary result:** Topology-independent communication achieves 2 expected messages per iteration regardless of network size

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the communication bottleneck in distributed optimization by proposing BlockProx, a method that achieves topology-independent communication efficiency. The key insight is randomized local coordination: each node independently samples one regularizer and coordinates only with nodes sharing that term, reducing expected communication from O(m) to exactly 2 messages per iteration for graph-guided regularizers. The method preserves convergence guarantees while eliminating global synchronization, achieving O(ε^-2) iteration complexity for convex objectives and O(ε^-1) under strong convexity.

## Method Summary
BlockProx operates by having each node sample one local regularizer per iteration and coordinate only with nodes that share this regularizer, rather than performing global synchronization. This randomized coordination mechanism ensures that each node communicates with exactly one other node on average, regardless of the network topology or problem size. The method maintains convergence guarantees through careful control of the variance introduced by the randomization, using standard analysis techniques adapted for the decentralized setting. The approach is particularly effective for problems with graph-guided regularizers where the communication pattern naturally corresponds to the problem structure.

## Key Results
- Achieves O(ε^-2) iteration complexity for convex objectives and O(ε^-1) for strongly convex cases
- Reduces expected communication from O(m) to exactly 2 messages per iteration regardless of network size
- Experiments validate superior performance compared to existing decentralized methods across synthetic and real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The randomized local coordination mechanism works by exploiting the structure of graph-guided regularizers, where nodes only need to coordinate with their immediate neighbors to optimize shared terms. By sampling one regularizer per iteration and communicating only with nodes sharing that term, the method eliminates unnecessary global synchronization while maintaining sufficient information flow for convergence. The variance introduced by randomization is controlled through the proximal operator structure, ensuring that convergence guarantees are preserved despite the reduced communication.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph-guided regularization:** Regularizers that couple variables across nodes in a graph structure - needed to understand the communication pattern and why local coordination suffices
- **Decentralized optimization:** Optimization where nodes only communicate with neighbors rather than a central coordinator - needed to appreciate the communication bottleneck being addressed
- **Proximal operators:** Operators that handle non-smooth terms in optimization problems - needed to understand how the method handles the regularization terms
- **Convergence analysis:** Mathematical techniques for proving optimization algorithms converge - needed to verify that the randomized approach maintains theoretical guarantees

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Nodes -> Local computation -> Random regularizer sampling -> Neighbor communication -> Update
- **Critical path:** Each node samples regularizer → communicates with one neighbor → performs local update → repeats
- **Design tradeoffs:** Reduced communication vs. potential variance increase; simplicity vs. possible suboptimality of uniform sampling
- **Failure signatures:** Slow convergence may indicate poor sampling distribution or inappropriate problem formulation
- **First experiments:** 1) Verify 2-message communication on simple chain topology, 2) Test convergence rates on synthetic convex problems, 3) Compare performance with centralized method on small network

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Does not address non-convex settings or provide robustness guarantees when convexity assumptions are violated
- Assumes uniform sampling of regularizers, which may not be optimal for all problem structures
- Limited experimental validation to specific datasets and problem types

## Confidence
- Communication complexity claims: **High** - Theoretical analysis and experiments consistently demonstrate 2 expected messages per iteration
- Convergence rate guarantees: **High** - Standard analysis techniques applied appropriately for convex and strongly convex cases
- Practical performance superiority: **Medium** - Experimental results are convincing but limited to specific datasets and problem types

## Next Checks
1. Test scalability and performance on non-convex problems common in deep learning to assess method robustness beyond convex settings
2. Evaluate sensitivity to sampling distributions - test whether adaptive or weighted sampling of regularizers could improve convergence
3. Measure communication overhead in heterogeneous network environments with varying bandwidth and latency to verify practical efficiency gains
