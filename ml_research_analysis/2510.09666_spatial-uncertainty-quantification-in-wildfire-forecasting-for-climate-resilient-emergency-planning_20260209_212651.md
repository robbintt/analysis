# Spatial Uncertainty Quantification in Wildfire Forecasting for Climate-Resilient Emergency Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.09666
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09666
- Reference count: 10
- Authors: Aditya Chakravarty
- Primary result: First systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in high-resolution wildfire forecasting, identifying coherent 20-60 meter buffer zones near fire perimeters

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in high-resolution wildfire forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. The authors demonstrate that predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near fire perimeters, forming consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines. Through feature attribution, they identify vegetation health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. Deep Ensembles achieve the strongest calibration with Brier Score of 0.265±0.009 and NLL of 0.731±0.023. This uncertainty quantification framework enables more robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to increasing fire risk under climate change, providing actionable insights for emergency planning and resource allocation.

## Method Summary
The method employs a UTAE (Uncertainty-aware Temporal Attention Encoder) architecture with temporal attention blocks and dropout for epistemic uncertainty quantification. The model processes 5-day sequences of VIIRS bands (I1, I2, M11), NDVI, EVI2, and active fire masks, outputting 64×64 burn probability maps at 375m resolution. Uncertainty is quantified through MC Dropout (20 passes) and Deep Ensembles (multiple independently-trained models). The framework includes weighted BCE loss with AdamW optimization (lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.01), 10,000 training steps, batch size 32, and data augmentations including random cropping to 128×128, flips, and 90° rotations. Feature attribution uses Integrated Gradients to identify vegetation health and fire activity as primary drivers of both predictions and uncertainty patterns.

## Key Results
- Predictive uncertainty forms coherent spatial structures concentrated near fire perimeters (20-60 meter buffer zones)
- Deep Ensembles achieve best calibration with Brier Score 0.265±0.009 and NLL 0.731±0.023
- Vegetation health indices (NDVI, EVI2) and active fire presence drive both prediction accuracy and uncertainty patterns
- Feature attribution identifies vegetation health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Predictive uncertainty forms coherent spatial structures concentrated near fire perimeters rather than random noise.
- Mechanism: The UTAE architecture learns to associate high-uncertainty regions with boundary conditions where fire spread is inherently less predictable—the transition zone between burned and unburned areas exhibits competing influences from vegetation, terrain, and weather that create epistemic uncertainty.
- Core assumption: Fire perimeter dynamics are the primary source of model uncertainty, not data quality or sensor noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near fire perimeters"
  - [Section 4.3] "Uncertainty estimates form coherent spatial patterns concentrated near predicted fire perimeters rather than scattered noise"
  - [corpus] Related work "Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Wildfire Danger Forecasting" (FMR 0.569) addresses uncertainty but at coarser danger forecasting scales; this paper extends to fine-grained spatial structure
- Break condition: If uncertainty maps appear randomly distributed without spatial coherence, or if high-uncertainty regions do not correlate with perimeter proximity, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vegetation health indices (NDVI, EVI2) and active fire presence drive both prediction accuracy and uncertainty patterns.
- Mechanism: The model's temporal attention mechanism prioritizes vegetation state changes and thermal anomalies as primary signals—when these features are ambiguous (e.g., mixed vegetation health, partial fire detection), uncertainty increases proportionally in adjacent spatial regions.
- Core assumption: Vegetation features contain the most predictive signal for next-day fire spread; weather and topography features introduce noise at the 375m/24hr resolution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Feature attribution identifies vegetation health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers"
  - [Table 1] Vegetation + active fire achieves AP 0.378±0.083, outperforming weather (0.323), land cover (0.319), and topography (0.317)
  - [Appendix A.1] "Active fire presence dominates attribution, followed by vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI2)"
  - [corpus] "A Probabilistic Approach to Wildfire Spread Prediction Using a Denoising Diffusion Surrogate Model" (FMR 0.551) uses different generative approach but does not provide feature attribution for uncertainty
- Break condition: If ablation studies show weather or topography features improve performance, or if Integrated Gradients attribution shows different feature importance, the claimed mechanism is incomplete.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Deep Ensembles provide better-calibrated uncertainty than MC Dropout or Bayesian Neural Networks for this task.
- Mechanism: Ensembling multiple independently-trained UTAE models captures uncertainty from weight initialization, training stochasticity, AND dropout randomness—providing broader coverage of the posterior than single-model approximations.
- Core assumption: Model uncertainty in wildfire forecasting is primarily epistemic (model-dependent) rather than aleatoric (data noise); ensemble diversity captures meaningful posterior variance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [Table 2] Deep Ensembles: Brier Score 0.265±0.009 vs MC Dropout 0.294±0.012 vs BNN 0.283±0.019
  - [Section 3.3] "Predictions are aggregated to quantify uncertainty from weight initialization, training stochasticity, and dropout randomness"
  - [corpus] Limited direct comparison in corpus; probabilistic GAN and diffusion approaches offer alternative uncertainty frameworks but calibration metrics not directly comparable
- Break condition: If ensemble members converge to similar solutions (low diversity), or if NLL/Brier scores degrade with more ensemble members, the mechanism weakens.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**
  - Why needed here: Evaluates whether predicted probabilities match empirical accuracy—critical for trusting uncertainty estimates in emergency planning contexts.
  - Quick check question: If a model predicts 70% confidence across 100 samples, do approximately 70 of them actually burn?

- Concept: **Temporal Attention in Encoder-Decoder Architectures**
  - Why needed here: UTAE uses multi-head self-attention across the 5-day input sequence to weight which temporal observations matter most for predicting next-day spread.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how attention weights from the bottleneck get upsampled and applied to skip connections?

- Concept: **Centroid-Oriented Boundary Distance vs Hausdorff Distance**
  - Why needed here: Different distance metrics capture different operational needs—centroid distance for typical offset, Hausdorff for worst-case scenarios in evacuation planning.
  - Quick check question: Which metric would you use to guarantee no evacuation route falls within predicted error bounds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing → temporal encoding → attention-weighted decoding → ensemble aggregation → buffer zone extraction via centroid/ASD/Hausdorff metrics
- Critical path: Input preprocessing → temporal encoding → attention-weighted decoding → ensemble aggregation → buffer zone extraction via centroid/ASD/Hausdorff metrics
- Design tradeoffs:
  - UTAE (1M params) chosen over Swin Transformer (27M params): trades capacity for reduced overfitting risk on limited wildfire data
  - Vegetation-only features vs all features: sacrificing 0.059 AP for more interpretable uncertainty attribution
  - Centroid metric vs Hausdorff: computational efficiency vs worst-case guarantees
- Failure signatures:
  - Disconnected fire fronts cause centroid metric misalignment (per Appendix limitations)
  - Small/fragmented fires show diffuse uncertainty rather than tight perimeter bands
  - Adding weather/topography features unexpectedly degrades performance (resolution mismatch suspected)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Reproduce calibration hierarchy**: Train 5 UTAE ensemble members with different seeds; verify Deep Ensembles achieve Brier Score ~0.265 and outperform single-model MC Dropout
  2. **Spatial structure validation**: Compute uncertainty maps for 3 test fires of varying sizes; quantify buffer zones using centroid, ASD, and Hausdorff metrics to confirm 20-60m range
  3. **Feature ablation with uncertainty**: Retrain with weather+active fire features only; compare not just AP but uncertainty spatial coherence to vegetation-based model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does incorporating aleatoric uncertainty quantification alongside epistemic uncertainty affect the spatial structure and calibration of wildfire forecasting uncertainty estimates?
- Can the identified uncertainty buffer zones (20-60 meters) generalize to fire regimes outside the western United States with different vegetation, climate, and topography characteristics?
- Would improving the spatial and temporal resolution alignment of weather and topography features enable these inputs to improve—rather than degrade—predictive performance and uncertainty quantification?
- How does predictive uncertainty compound or propagate across multi-day forecast horizons beyond the single next-day prediction evaluated in this study?

## Limitations
- Spatial coherence of uncertainty patterns may depend on specific dataset composition and fire behavior characteristics
- UTAE architecture's effectiveness relies on adequate temporal attention modeling within 5-day sequence constraints
- Calibration superiority of Deep Ensembles assumes epistemic uncertainty dominates

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Spatial uncertainty patterns near fire perimeters (supported by clear metrics across multiple distance measures and coherent visual patterns)
- **Medium confidence**: Deep Ensembles calibration performance (consistent improvement over alternatives but dependent on ensemble size and diversity assumptions)
- **Low confidence**: Feature attribution mechanism (dominance of vegetation/active fire features shown but complex interactions with weather/topography not fully explored)

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset generalization test**: Apply the trained UTAE ensemble to fire events from different geographic regions or ecosystems not represented in the original training set, measuring whether the 20-60m buffer zone pattern holds.
2. **Resolution sensitivity analysis**: Retrain with 250m resolution inputs (if available) to verify that the uncertainty quantification framework maintains coherence when sensor resolution changes, testing the mechanism's robustness to spatial scale.
3. **Ensemble diversity quantification**: Measure pairwise cosine similarity between ensemble member predictions across all test samples to verify that Deep Ensembles capture meaningful uncertainty diversity rather than converging to similar solutions.
